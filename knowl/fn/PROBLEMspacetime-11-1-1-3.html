</h6>If <span class="process-math">\(x\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(y\text{,}\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(z\)</span> are spatial coordinates, <span class="process-math">\(t\)</span> is time, and the constant <span class="process-math">\(c\)</span> is the speed of light then the expression on the left-hand side represents the square of the distance between the origin and the point <span class="process-math">\((x,y,z,t)\)</span> in <span class="process-math">\(4\)</span> dimensional, relativistic, spacetime.  Setting this equal to zero allows us to identify all of the events that an observer at the origin is observing at a given instant. For example, if there is a solar flare happening on the sun <span class="process-math">\(93\)</span> million miles away from the earth, then we observe it <span class="process-math">\(8\)</span> minutes later.  The spacetime distance is zero to allow for the simultaneity of the event happening and us observing it.  The closest galaxy to the Milky Way Galaxy is the Andromeda Galaxy which is approximately <span class="process-math">\(2.5\)</span> million light-years away.  This means that the light we are observing now originated 2.5 million years ago but the spacetime distance between the two events (called the <a class="external" href="https://mathshistory.st-andrews.ac.uk/Biographies/Minkowski/" target="_blank">Minkowski</a> distance) is still zero.</div>
