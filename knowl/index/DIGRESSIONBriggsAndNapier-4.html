<div class="para"> Napier had had the same idea himself, but was unable to pursue it “on account of ill-health.” As a result, Briggs took on the task of computing tables of base–<span class="process-math">\(10\)</span> logarithms, collaborating with Napier until the latter’s death two years later. The results of their collaboration are known as the Briggsian or <dfn class="terminology">Common Logarithms</dfn>. Common Logarithms are the base <span class="process-math">\(10\)</span> logarithms we discussed earlier and were an important computational aid for nearly <span class="process-math">\(400\)</span> years until the invention of modern computational technologies.</div>
