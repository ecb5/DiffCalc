<section class="paragraphs"><h4 class="heading"><span class="title">DIGRESSION: The Art of Guessing Effectively.</span></h4>  <div class="para">No, really.  Guessing can be surprisingly effective.</div> <div class="para">You know this of course. You’ve been doing it all of your life, but in the past -- especially in math classes -- guessing was probably discouraged so you tend to deny doing it, possibly even to yourself. It’s OK. Guess anyway. We won’t tell anyone.</div> <div class="para">The fact is that guessing is a tried and true solution technique and we encourage you to use it regularly.  Guessing is nothing more, or less, than relying on your native intuition.</div> <div class="para">Effective guessing is a skill. You need practice to do it well and, unfortunately, you have probably not had much chance to practice that skill in the context of mathematics.  So we encourage you to guess often from now on. But be aware that making a guess is a process, not an event. If you guess wrong, which is most likely, then you have a new, related problem to think about: All of your intuition said this was a good guess.  Why didn’t it work?  The answer to that question almost always gives some insight into the original problem.  Even a bad guess can be useful.</div> <div class="para">However a bad guess, indeed any guess,  in isolation is a waste of time. You must also take the time to figure out why your bad guess doesn’t work.</div> <div class="para">But the real danger in guessing -- the reason it is usually discouraged -- is that when you do guess correctly, or nearly so, it is  very tempting to just move on from there. Don’t do that.</div> <div class="para">Guessing correctly means that your intuition was very good. But intuition is unconscious.  It is at least as important to understand where a good guess came from, and why it worked as it is to understand why a bad guess didn’t work.  But when you guess well it is extremely tempting to just take your good guess and run with it. This will invariably lead to confusion later. So, when you guess correctly take a few moments to think about the intuition that led you to that guess.  Bring that intuition out of your unconscious mind and into your conscious mind.  If you don’t do that your guesses are a waste of your time.</div> <div class="para">So let’s take a guess. There is no need to get really crazy about it though. We already know that the Taylor polynomial of <span class="process-math">\(\exp(x)\)</span> approximates <span class="process-math">\(\exp(x)\text{.}\)</span> Maybe we can find an <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span> large enough that the approximation becomes exact.</div> <article class="problem example-like"><h5 class="heading">

<div class="para">In fact, we almost have a solution here. One million is a very large number, so one million factorial (<span class="process-math">\(1000000!\)</span>) is inconceivably large.

<div class="para">are pretty much the same thing.</div>
</div> <div class="para">So we’re .\ .\ . done, .\ .\ . right?</div> <div class="para">No, of course not. Although that last term really is practically zero it is not actually zero, no matter how small it is.  As Newton said, “In mathematics the smallest of errors must be dealt with\aside{Newton wrote his scientific works in Latin.

In particular we know that the Taylor polynomial <span class="process-math">\(1+x+\frac{x^2}{2!}+\frac{x^3}{3!} + \ldots +
\frac{x^{999999}}{999999!} + \frac{x^{1000000}}{1000000!}\)</span> will be a very good approximation of <span class="process-math">\(\exp(x)\text{,}\)</span> at least for  values of <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> near zero.</div> <div class="para">But if there is no polynomial that solves <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/xref/IVPExpDiffeq.html" title="Equation 8.1">equation~ (8.1)</a>) does that mean there is no solution at all? Certainly not. In fact, since that last term of the polynomial seems to be the stumbling block the solution is clear: All we need to do is not have a last term.</div> <div class="para logical">
<div class="para">This is a startling idea but before we dismiss it, let’s take our own advice from <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">[cross-reference to target(s) "DIGRESSEffectiveGuessing" missing or not unique]</code>. We’ll trust our intuition, but also examine it closely.

</div>
<div class="para">where the dots at the end mean that the summation goes on forever. There is no last term.</div>
</div> <div class="para">You would expect a polynomial that doesn’t end to be called an infinite polynomial but it is not. Such an expression is called an <dfn class="terminology">infinite series.</dfn> Usually we  just call it a series. A series is not a polynomial. That is, a polynomial is defined to have only finitely many terms and a series is defined to have infinitely many terms. We distinguish them from each other specifically so that we don’t confuse a series with a polynomial.</div> <div class="para">An obvious question to ask is, “Does this infinite series even mean anything?” Or, equivalently, “What does it mean to add up infinitely many numbers?”  These are excellent questions which will have to be addressed eventually. But for now we won’t let them trouble us. We’ll just assume that <span class="process-math">\(y=1+x+\frac{x^2}{2!}+\frac{x^3}{3!}+\ldots\)</span> makes sense, in the same way we assumed that differentials make sense and defer those questions until later.</div> <article class="problem example-like"><h5 class="heading">
