<div class="para">Do you think the function <span class="process-math">\(y(x) = \sqrt{x^2+2}-\sqrt{x^2+x}\)</span> has any horizontal asymptotes? Take your best guess before we begin this example. To find any horizontal asymptotes we have to evaluate the two limits</div>

<div class="para">First we’ll find the limit as <span class="process-math">\(x\rightarrow\infty\)</span> and leave the limit as <span class="process-math">\(x\rightarrow-\infty\)</span> as a drill  for you.</div>

<div class="para">As always the trick is to rearrange this expression inside the limit algebraically — without changing its value — until we can see clearly what happens as <span class="process-math">\(x\rightarrow\infty\text{.}\)</span> The square roots seem to be the difficulty here.

<div class="para">Did you guess right? If you did, either you have a very strong intuition for these kinds of problems or you just had a moment of blind luck. So don’t just pat yourself on the back and walk away. Be sure to take a moment to figure out whether it was intuition or luck. You don’t want to confuse them.</div>
<div class="para">If you guessed wrong, or (most likely) were unable to come up with a guess don’t fret about it. You’re normal. But be sure you review and understand the steps to this solution so you can begin to build some intuition about such problems. This problem looked pretty intimidating, but once we got going in the right direction, it was all Algebra from there.  Notice how the absolute value came into play. In this problem it wasn’t an issue since we were considering only positive values of <span class="process-math">\(x\text{.}\)</span> But consider what would happen if <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> was negative, if <span class="process-math">\(x\rightarrow-\infty\text{.}\)</span> In this case, <span class="process-math">\(\abs{x}=-x.\)</span>
