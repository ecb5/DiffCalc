<div class="para">Before  reading further consider reviewing <a href="SECTIONinverse-tan-and-cot.html#DIGRESSIONInverse-function-notation" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/xref/DIGRESSIONInverse-function-notation.html" data-reveal-label="Reveal" data-close-label="Close" title="Digression: DIGRESSION: Inverse Function Notation">Inverse Function Notation</a>. It will probably help.</div>
<div class="para"> As we’ve observed the <dfn class="terminology">natural logarithm</dfn> function is, by definition, the inverse of the <dfn class="terminology">natural exponential</dfn> in precisely the same way that <span class="process-math">\(\inverse\tan(x)\)</span> is, by definition, the inverse of <span class="process-math">\(\tan(x)\)</span> .  Unfortunately the notation that is used for the <dfn class="terminology">natural exponential</dfn> and the <dfn class="terminology">natural logarithm</dfn> is not helpful.</div>
<div class="para logical">
<div class="para">It has become standard practice to notate a function using the first three letters of its name. That is why the trigonometric functions are denoted</div>
<div class="displaymath process-math">
\begin{align*}
\sin,\amp{}\amp{} \cos,\amp{}\amp{}
\tan,\amp{}\amp{} \cot,\amp{}\amp{}  \sec,\amp{}\amp{}
\text{and} \amp{}\amp{}\csc.
\end{align*}
</div>
<div class="para">By that standard we should properly denote the natural exponential with “<span class="process-math">\(\exp(x)\)</span>” and the natural logarithm with “<span class="process-math">\(\log(x)
\text{.}\)</span>” But instead we use <span class="process-math">\(e^x\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(\ln(x) \text{.}\)</span>
</div>
</div>
<div class="para">We have used <span class="process-math">\(\exp(x) \)</span> for the natural exponential in the past and will continue to use it when we want to emphasize the functional nature of the natural exponential, but most of the time it is more helpful to think of it as the number “<span class="process-math">\(e\)</span> raised to a power” and to denote it with <span class="process-math">\(e^x\)</span> which, unfortunately, doesn’t look like the name of a function at all.</div>
<div class="para">Even worse, when we talk among ourselves mathematicians tend to use the natural logarithm because for us it is the most important, but we often denote it as “<span class="process-math">\(\log(x)\text{.}\)</span>” When we are talking to scientists and engineers we use whichever notation is appropriate to their discipline.</div>
<div class="para">Sometimes there are reasons to use logarithms with bases other than <span class="process-math">\(10\)</span> or <span class="process-math">\(e\text{.}\)</span> For example, computer scientists frequently use logarithms with a base of <span class="process-math">\(2\)</span> which they denote <span class="process-math">\(\text{lb}(x)\)</span> (binary logarithm).</div>
<div class="para">None of this affects what the natural logarithm is, how we use it, or how we think about it. Only how we write it. We only bring this up to warn you that because of this wide variation in usage logarithmic notation can be hard to get comfortable with. Be careful. The generic notation is <span class="process-math">\(\log_b(x)\)</span> where <span class="process-math">\(b\)</span> indicates the base. In this scheme the natural logarithm is <span class="process-math">\(\log_{e}(x)\text{,}\)</span> the common logarithm is <span class="process-math">\(\log_{10}(x)\text{,}\)</span> and the binary logarithm is <span class="process-math">\(\log_{2}(x)\text{.}\)</span> If you find yourself getting confused it can help to revert to this generic notation.</div>
<div class="para">It is, after all, just notation. Do not confuse the name of a concept with the concept itself. Conceptually the natural logarithm  is the inverse of the natural exponential and you should think of it as such.</div>
<div class="para">It is often helpful to think of <span class="process-math">\(\ln(x)\)</span> as the function that peels the exponent off of <span class="process-math">\(e^x\)</span> as in <a href="SECTIONnatural-logarithm-1.html#LogProp1" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/xref/LogProp1.html" data-reveal-label="Reveal" data-close-label="Close" title="Logarithm Property 8.8.0.3">Logarithm Property #1</a>  <span class="process-math">\(\ln(e^x)=x\text{.}\)</span>
