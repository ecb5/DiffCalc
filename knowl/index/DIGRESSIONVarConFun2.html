<div class="para">Suppose that <span class="process-math">\(y=x^3\text{.}\)</span> It is clear that <span class="process-math">\(y\)</span> depends on <span class="process-math">\(x\text{,}\)</span> so we denote this functional dependence with the notation</div>

<div class="para"> Lagrange called the differential ratio <span class="process-math">\(\dfdx{y}{x}\text{,}\)</span> a derived function. The “derived” part seems clear enough. After all, if <span class="process-math">\(y=x^3\)</span> them <span class="process-math">\(\dfdx{y}{x}\)</span> is obtained (derived) from <span class="process-math">\(y\)</span> as follows:</div>

<div class="para"> Since  <span class="process-math">\(\dfdx{y}{x}\)</span> depends on <span class="process-math">\(3x^2\)</span> as a function it would not be wrong  to denote this functional dependence as</div>
<div class="displaymath process-math">
\begin{equation*}
\dfdx{y}{x}(x) = 3x^2
\end{equation*}
</div>
<div class="para">but it would be awkward. Moreover, Lagrange was trying to get away from the use of differentials so instead he wrote</div>
<div class="displaymath process-math">
\begin{equation*}
y^\prime(x)=3x^2
\end{equation*}
</div>
<div class="para">and called <span class="process-math">\(y^\prime(x)\)</span> the  <i class="foreign">fonction dérivée</i> of <span class="process-math">\(y(x)\text{.}\)</span> In English the phrase <i class="foreign">fonction dérivée</i> has been shortened to the <dfn class="terminology">derivative</dfn>.</div>
</div>
<div class="para"> In some contexts Lagrange’s prime notation has several advantages over the differential notation we’ve been using. Over time it has become the most common notation for the <dfn class="terminology">derivative</dfn> in mathematics. But the fact that it took over <span class="process-math">\(100\)</span> years to develop suggests that something more than mere notation is in play here.</div>
<div class="para">Using multiple equivalent notations can be very confusing for beginners. Since our current task is simply to master the differentiation rules we will stick to Leibniz’s differential notation as much as possible.  But there will come a time when Lagrange’s prime notation will be much more convenient.  At that point we will casually use the two expressions <span class="process-math">\(\dfdx{y}{x}\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(y^\prime(x)\)</span> interchangeably and we will think of them both as a function <em class="emphasis">derived from</em> the function <span class="process-math">\(y(x)\text{.}\)</span>
</div>
<div class="para">When we do this the differential notation we’re currently emphasizing will take on two distinct “personalities.” On the one hand <span class="process-math">\(\dfdx{y}{x}\)</span> represents a ratio of the differentials <span class="process-math">\(\dx{y}\text{,}\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(\dx{x}\)</span> which are distinct infinitesimal quantities. On the other hand <span class="process-math">\(\dfdx{y}{x}\)</span> is the name of a function -- it is all one symbol. When we are thinking of <span class="process-math">\(\dfdx{y}{x}\)</span> as the derivative function we cannot detach the pieces of <span class="process-math">\(\dfdx{y}{x}\)</span> any more than can delete the letter “n” from <span class="process-math">\(\sin(x)\)</span> because <span class="process-math">\(\text{si}(x)\)</span> has no meaning.</div>
<div class="para">Eventually the differentials we’ve been using so casually will become a guilty secret. Given <span class="process-math">\(y=y(x)\)</span> we’ll use them as a helpful aid while we <em class="emphasis">compute</em>. But as soon as we have <span class="process-math">\(\dfdx{y}{x}\)</span> in hand we will view it as a single, complete symbol representing the (finite) derivative function. Often we will simply replace it with <span class="process-math">\(y^\prime(x)\)</span> as if we are ashamed of having used differentials at all.</div>
<div class="para">This more advanced viewpoint will become commonplace later, but to give you a preview, consider the following problem.</div>

<div class="introduction">
<div class="para">Recall that in Descartes’ Method of Normals, we had to find a double root of a polynomial.  To deal with this problem, <a class="external" href="https://mathshistory.st-andrews.ac.uk/Biographies/Hudde/" target="_blank">Johann van Waveren Hudde</a><details class="ptx-footnote" aria-live="polite" id="PROBLEMHuddesRule-1-1-3"><summary class="ptx-footnote__number" title="Footnote 5.21"><sup> 21 </sup></summary><div class="ptx-footnote__contents" id="PROBLEMHuddesRule-1-1-3"><code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">https://mathshistory.st-andrews.ac.uk/Biographies/Hudde/</code></div></details> (1628–1704) developed an algebraic tool for determining such double roots.  Calculus allows a development of Hudde’s Rule that does not require the complex algebraic reasoning that Hudde used and is much easier to follow.</div>
<aside class="aside aside-like"><h5 class="heading"><span class="title">Historical Background.</span></h5>
<div class="para">Actually Hudde did considerably more than this. His method for finding double roots was a part of what has been called the “Lost Calculus” of algebraic functions.
