For example, suppose we have a point <span class="process-math">\((x,y)\)</span> lying on the unit circle so that the quantities <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(y\)</span> are related by the equation <span class="process-math">\(x^2+y^2=1\text{.}\)</span>

<div class="para">Let’s look at this geometrically and focus on the first quadrant. The sketch above shows what happens to the quantities <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(y\)</span> as the point changes its position on the circle.</div>
<div class="para"> The smaller triangle is called a <dfn class="terminology">differential triangle</dfn> and it is infinitely small. Differential triangles were a favorite tool of Leibniz. He assumed without justification (as we will, for now) that they are just like ordinary (finite) triangles.</div>
<div class="para">Notice that <span class="process-math">\(\dx{x}\)</span> is negative since the <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> coordinate is moving to the left, and that <span class="process-math">\(\dx{y}\)</span> is positive since the <span class="process-math">\(y\)</span> coordinate is moving upward. We need positive quantities to represent the length of the triangle’s legs. Therefore we use <span class="process-math">\(-\dx{x}\)</span> to represent a positive length for the horizontal leg of our differential triangle.</div>
<div class="para">A little more mysterious is the (correct) observation that the smaller triangle isn’t really a triangle at all. Because it is part of the circle the line connecting <span class="process-math">\((x,y)\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\((x+\dx{x},
y+\dx{y})\)</span> — the hypotenuse of the triangle — is curved.  But there is nothing lost by thinking of the hypotenuse as a straight line because according to the <dfn class="terminology">Principle of Local Linearity</dfn> at an infinitely small scale lines and curves are indistinguishable.  At least in part, this why Newton, Leibniz, and their contemporaries worked with differentials. At that scale they could replace curves with straight lines.</div></article><span class="incontext"><a class="internal" href="SECTIONsome-rules-diff.html#EXAMPLELocalLinearityCircle">in-context</a></span>
