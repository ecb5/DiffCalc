<div class="para">Since we know the lengths of the sides <span class="process-math">\(a\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(b\)</span> of our triangle let’s draw it. The sketch below would be typical. The question is, what length for side <span class="process-math">\(c\)</span> makes the total area enclosed by the triangle as large as it can possibly be?</div>

<div class="para">Now what?</div>
<div class="para">Well, this looks like a right triangle doesn’t it? If it is a right triangle, then we can find the length of <span class="process-math">\(c\)</span> via the Pythagorean Theorem: <span class="process-math">\(c=\sqrt{a^2+b^2},\)</span> right?</div>
<div class="para">Before you go on take a moment and really think about this problem. Can it really be that simple? Can you find any flaws in our reasoning.</div>
<div class="para">Once you think about it you see that we have no reason to believe that the triangle we seek must be a right triangle. It was completely accidental that we drew our diagram that way. If this seems like a simple-minded mistake, the sort of mistake that you would never make, be careful. It is a mistake to rely too heavily on the diagrams we draw. But it is an easy mistake to make, especially when the problems are more complicated, because as problems get complex we will need to rely on visualization more and more. This was not a dumb mistake. It was just a bit careless, and it is easy to be careless, especially when we first start thinking about a problem.</div>
