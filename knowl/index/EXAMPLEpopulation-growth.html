<div class="para">Suppose we start with a colony of <span class="process-math">\(10\)</span> grams of bacteria in a Petri dish and we wish to model the growth of the population as a function of time. In order to keep our initial discussion simple we begin by assuming that <span class="process-math">\(30\)</span>% of our bacteria divide once per day at the same time.  Such a population is growing at a rate of <span class="process-math">\(30\)</span>% per day.  If we start with <span class="process-math">\(10\)</span> grams of bacteria on day zero, then on day one we’ll have <span class="process-math">\(30%\)</span> more, or <span class="process-math">\(13\)</span> grams. On day two we’ll have <span class="process-math">\(30\%\)</span> more than on day one, or <span class="process-math">\(16.9\)</span> grams. It should be clear that the rate of growth from day <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span> to day <span class="process-math">\(n+1\)</span> is proportional to how many bacteria we have on day <span class="process-math">\(n\text{.}\)</span> Thus from any one day to the next we see that the change in <span class="process-math">\(P\)</span> (that is,  <span class="process-math">\(\Delta P\)</span>) is given by</div>
<div class="displaymath process-math">
\begin{equation}
\Delta P = 0.3 P\Delta t\tag{8.17}
\end{equation}
</div>
<div class="para">where <span class="process-math">\(\Delta t = 1\)</span> day, and <span class="process-math">\(\Delta P\)</span> is the change in population on that day.</div>
</div> <div class="para">But we assumed that <span class="process-math">\(30\)</span>% of the bacteria were dividing in sync once per day, which is unrealistic. To get closer to reality suppose next that enough of them divide during any one hour so that at the end of one day the population has still grown by <span class="process-math">\(30\)</span>%. Then from any one hour to the next we again have <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/xref/EQUATIONDiscBacterModel.html" title="Equation 8.17">equation (8.17)</a> but this time <span class="process-math">\(\Delta t\)</span> is equal to one hour, or <span class="process-math">\(\frac{1}{24}\)</span> day.  However, we don’t have to measure time in days. If we measure it in hours instead we again have <span class="process-math">\(\Delta t=1 \text{ hour } = \frac{1}{24} \text{ day}\text{.}\)</span> The constant factor is still <span class="process-math">\(0.3\)</span> because we assumed that the population was growing at <span class="process-math">\(30%\)</span> per day, and this is still true. That factor is called the <dfn class="terminology">nominal</dfn> growth rate.</div> <aside class="aside aside-like"><h5 class="heading"><span class="title">Mathematical Terminology.</span></h5>
<div class="para">The word nominal means “in name or thought” so this is the named growth rate. It is not always the actual growth rate as we will see soon.</div></aside> <div class="para logical">
<div class="para">If we measure time in seconds the same reasoning will give us <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/xref/EQUATIONDiscBacterModel.html" title="Equation 8.17">equation (8.17)</a>, with <span class="process-math">\(\Delta t=1 \text{ second }

<div class="para">Since we started with <span class="process-math">\(10\)</span> grams of bacteria we have the initial condition <span class="process-math">\(P(0)=10\text{.}\)</span> This says that the amount of bacteria at time <span class="process-math">\(t\)</span> must satisfy the IVP:</div>
