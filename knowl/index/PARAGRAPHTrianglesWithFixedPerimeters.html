Is this also true of triangles? More precisely, does an equilateral triangle have the largest area out of all triangles with a fixed perimeter?  This may sound like a simpler problem but it is actually a bit harder.</div> <div class="para">Here’s why. With a rectangle each set of parallel sides varied together so we only had two independent parameters to deal with. For triangles all three sides vary independently, giving us three independently varying parameters, which is inherently more complex than two.</div> <div class="para">How might we address this question?</div> <div class="para">A standard ploy for solving difficult problems is to first try a simpler “adjacent” problem. To create such a problem in this case we hold one side fixed and only allow two sides of our triangle to vary. We’ll show that when the area of the triangle is maximal the two varying sides must be the same length. We want to use this adjacent problem to gain some insight into how to solve our actual problem.</div> <div class="para">So our adjacent problem is this: Given all triangles with a fixed base and a fixed perimeter, does an isosceles triangle have the largest area?  The sketch below has all of the pertinent parameters labeled.</div> <figure class="figure figure-like"><div class="image-box" style="width: 40%; margin-left: 30%; margin-right: 30%;"><img src="external/DC/Optimization3.png" class="contained"></div>

<div class="para"> Holmes is using a tried and true mathematical proof technique, known colloquially as “the process of elimination.” In mathematics it goes by its Latin name <i class="foreign"><dfn class="terminology">Reductio Ad Absurdum</dfn></i> (RAA). If only one of two statements can be true — for example a triangle is either equilateral or it is not — we show logically that one of them is impossible under the constraints of the problem. We then conclude that the other statement must be true. In this way we “eliminate the impossible” so what is left “must be the truth.” \\ If more than two statements are possible and we can eliminate all but one, that one “must be the truth.” If only two statements are possible, as in this problem, the method is also called <dfn class="terminology">Proof by Contradiction</dfn>.</div></aside> <div class="para">Our solution will follow Holmes’ lead: We will eliminate what is impossible leaving only the truth behind.</div> <article class="problem example-like"><h5 class="heading">
