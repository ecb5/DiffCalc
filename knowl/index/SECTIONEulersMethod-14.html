<div class="para"> Next we increment <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> by <span class="process-math">\(0.1\)</span> again, to <span class="process-math">\(x=0.2\text{.}\)</span>  We would really like to have the equation of the line tangent to the curve at <span class="process-math">\((0.1, y(0.1))\)</span> but we simply have no way to obtain it. All we have is the point <span class="process-math">\((0.1, 1.1)\text{.}\)</span> But we know that <span class="process-math">\(y(0.1)\approx1.1\)</span> so the differential equation from <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/xref/IVPExpDiffeq1.html" title="Equation 7.6">IVP (7.6)</a>) tells us that <span class="process-math">\(\eval{\dfdx{y}{x}}{x}{0.1}\approx1.1\)</span> also. Thus we see that the curve will pass (approximately) through the point <span class="process-math">\((0.1, 1.1)\)</span> with slope (approximately) equal to <span class="process-math">\(1.1\text{.}\)</span> Therefore the equation of the line tangent to the curve at (approximately) <span class="process-math">\((0.1, 1.1)\)</span> will be <span class="process-math">\(y-1.1=1.1(x-0.1)\)</span> and as long as we don’t move too far the Principle of Local Linearity guarantees that this line and the curve we seek are close together. So we use the blue line segment from <span class="process-math">\((0.1, 1.1)\)</span> to <span class="process-math">\((0.2, 1.21)\)</span> in our figure above to approximate the curve on the interval <span class="process-math">\((0.1, 0.2)\text{.}\)</span>
