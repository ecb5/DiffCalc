<div class="para"> You would expect a polynomial that doesn’t end to be called an infinite polynomial but it is not. Such an expression is called an <dfn class="terminology">infinite series.</dfn> Usually we  just call it a series. A series is not a polynomial. That is, a polynomial is defined to have only finitely many terms and a series is defined to have infinitely many terms. We distinguish them from each other specifically so that we don’t confuse a series with a polynomial.</div>
