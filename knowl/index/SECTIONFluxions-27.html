<div class="introduction"><div class="para">The strength of a signal from a cell tower, measured in decibels is inversely proportional to the square of the distance between the tower and the cell phone.  Suppose you have a <span class="process-math">\(200\)</span> foot tall cell tower and a car driving away from the tower at a rate of <span class="process-math">\(100 \frac{\text{
ft}}{\text{second}}\)</span> (approximately <span class="process-math">\(68\)</span> mph). (The icon on your cell phone probably uses bars, but there is no universally agreed upon standard for what “one bar” means. There is a standard for decibels.)</div></div>
<article class="task exercise-like"><h5 class="heading"><span class="codenumber">(a)</span></h5>
<div class="para">Find a formula for the rate at which the signal is decreasing in terms of the distance <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> from the car to the base of the tower. (We suggest that you use <span class="process-math">\(k\)</span> to denote the constant of proportionality.)</div></article><article class="task exercise-like"><h5 class="heading"><span class="codenumber">(b)</span></h5>
<div class="para">Plot a graph of the formula in part (a) with <span class="process-math">\(x \ge 0\)</span> and use this to approximate the distance from the base of the tower where the signal decreases fastest. (Use <span class="process-math">\(k = 1000000\text{.}\)</span> You’ll see why we chose this scale once you’ve plotted it.)</div></article><article class="task exercise-like"><h5 class="heading"><span class="codenumber">(c)</span></h5>
<div class="para">Based on the graph, what is happening to the rate at which the signal is decreasing as the car moves farther away from the tower?</div></article></article><span class="incontext"><a class="internal" href="CHAPTERPTERVelocitySlopeTangent.html#SECTIONFluxions-27">in-context</a></span>
