<div class="para"> Mathematically speaking all optimization starts in the same place: We have some quantity (revenue, tax liability, temperature, resource consumption, travel time, potential energy, volume, surface area, whatever), which depends on one or more variables. The variables are (usually) constrained in some way, and we need to find conditions that make the quantity as large, or as small as possible within those constraints.  The “thing to be optimized” is called the <dfn class="terminology">objective function</dfn> and the constraints on the variables are called . . . well, they’re called the <dfn class="terminology">constraints</dfn>.</div>
