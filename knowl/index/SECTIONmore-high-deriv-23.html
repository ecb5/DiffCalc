<div class="para"> It seems clear that we could use this procedure in a “machine-like” way to produce a polynomial approximation of any degree.  In fact, this “machine” for producing approximating polynomials was known long before Lagrange, but he made it more tractable by replacing differentials and differential notation, which are very cumbersome to use here, with derivatives and his prime notation. In general this approximating polynomial is called a <dfn class="terminology">Taylor Polynomial</dfn> named after the English mathematician <a class="external" href="https://mathshistory.st-andrews.ac.uk/Biographies/Taylor/" target="_blank">Brook Taylor</a><details class="ptx-footnote" aria-live="polite" id="SECTIONmore-high-deriv-23-6"><summary class="ptx-footnote__number" title="Footnote 7.6"><sup> 6 </sup></summary><div class="ptx-footnote__contents" id="SECTIONmore-high-deriv-23-6"><code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">https://mathshistory.st-andrews.ac.uk/Biographies/Taylor/</code></div></details> (<span class="process-math">\(1685-1731\)</span>), but was known to mathematiciasn before Taylor (including Newton and Leibniz).</div>
