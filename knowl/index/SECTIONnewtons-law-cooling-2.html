<div class="para">Suppose a container of water at a temperature of <span class="process-math">\(40^\circ F\)</span> is placed into a freezer maintained at a constant temperature of <span class="process-math">\(5^\circ F.\)</span> We’d like to have a model that will allow us to compute how long it will take for the water to cool down to a temperature of, for example, <span class="process-math">\(32^\circ F\)</span> where it will start to freeze.</div> <div class="para"> In the late <span class="process-math">\(17\)</span>th century Isaac Newton showed experimentally that the rate at which the water cools will be proportional to the difference between its current temperature and the ambient (surrounding) temperature.

Then the difference between the current temperature and the ambient temperature is <span class="process-math">\(T-5\text{,}\)</span> and (as always) the rate of change of the temperature of the water with respect to time is <span class="process-math">\(\dfdx{T}{t}\text{,}\)</span> (or <span class="process-math">\(\dot{T}\)</span> if you are Newton).
