Does this rephrasing  work for you?</div> <blockquote class="blockquote"><div class="para">If <span class="process-math">\(y=\frac1x\text{,}\)</span> what does <span class="process-math">\(y\)</span> get close to as <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> grows larger and larger?</div></blockquote> <div class="para">This seems to be better. We have side-stepped the issue of the infinitely large by saying “larger and larger.” But unfortunately this rephrasing of the question changes its meaning.  To see what we mean, think of <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> as the radius of a balloon which we want to inflate as much as we possibly can. Suppose we know that when the radius of the balloon is <span class="process-math">\(8\)</span> it will pop. To avoid popping our balloon, we blow in enough air during the first second to expand the radius to <span class="process-math">\(x(1)=4\text{.}\)</span> In the next second we expand the radius to fill half of the remaining distance to <span class="process-math">\(x(2)=6\text{.}\)</span>  In the third we repeat the process, expanding it to <span class="process-math">\(x(3)=7\text{.}\)</span> And we continue in this fashion. At each second the radius of our balloon expands to half of the remaining distance to <span class="process-math">\(8\text{.}\)</span>
</div> <div class="para">Clearly the balloon’s radius grows larger each second, so <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> grows “larger and larger” as required. But the intent of our original question was for <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> to become “infinitely large,” not for <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> to remain smaller than <span class="process-math">\(8\text{.}\)</span>
</div> <div class="para">And there is nothing special about <span class="process-math">\(8\text{.}\)</span> If <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> moves half of the distance to <span class="process-math">\(16\)</span> each second, or halfway to <span class="process-math">\(32\text{,}\)</span> or even if it moves halfway to <span class="process-math">\(1,048,576\)</span> at each step we have the same problem.  In each case <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> is growing “larger and larger” but it is not growing in a manner that reflects what we think we mean when we say that <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> is growing “infinitely large.”</div> <article class="exercise exercise-like"><h5 class="heading">
