Try that some time when you have time to kill. Lots of time.</div>
</div>
<div class="para logical">
<div class="para">Instead, we’ll just apply our differentiation rules to <a href="SECTIONsome-rules-diff.html#EQUATIONQuadImpl" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/xref/EQUATIONQuadImpl.html" data-reveal-label="Reveal" data-close-label="Close" title="Equation 4.11">equation (4.11)</a> as it is.

<div class="para">At first this may look very difficult to solve for <span class="process-math">\(\dx{y}\)</span> but look again.

This will always happen. When we differentiate any expression the result will always be linear in the differentials involved.</div>
</div>
<div class="para logical">
<div class="para">The word “linear” has a very specific meaning in mathematics, but the precise definition isn’t relevant at the moment. For our current purpose it simply means that we can rearrange our equation algebraically so that it has the following form.</div>

<div class="para">Some problems are legitimately hard, and some only look hard. So remember that as bleak as things may look sometimes, you should always keep your goal in view. In this case we were trying to isolate <span class="process-math">\(\dx{y}\text{,}\)</span> so we gathered all of the terms that had <span class="process-math">\(\dx{y}\)</span> in them, put all the other terms on the other side of the equation, factored out the <span class="process-math">\(\dx{y}\)</span> and divided by the “stuff” that formed the coefficient of <span class="process-math">\(\dx{y}\text{.}\)</span>  This process is often easier than trying to solve for <span class="process-math">\(y\)</span> before differentiating.</div></article><span class="incontext"><a class="internal" href="SECTIONsome-rules-diff.html#SUBSECTIONPowerRule-45">in-context</a></span>
