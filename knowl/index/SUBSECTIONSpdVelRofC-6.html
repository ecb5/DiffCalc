<div class="para"> Speed is the rate of change we are most familiar with in daily life. If you are driving on a flat, straight, road your speed is the <dfn class="terminology">rate of change</dfn> of your position, <span class="process-math">\(\Delta x\text{,}\)</span> <dfn class="terminology">with respect to</dfn> the passage (change) of time, <span class="process-math">\(\Delta t\text{.}\)</span>  If your speedometer reads <span class="process-math">\(60\)</span> we say your speed is sixty miles per hour: <span class="process-math">\(60 \frac{\text{miles}}{\text{hour}}\text{,}\)</span> meaning of course that in one hour you will travel sixty miles. This is often abbreviated to <span class="process-math">\(60\)</span> mph. We will model a flat, straight, road as the <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span>-axis with the positive direction to the right, as is customary. Of course, on this flat, straight, road we could be going <span class="process-math">\(60 \frac{\text{miles}}{\text{hour}}\)</span> to the right or to the left. Since there are only two directions possible, we can again use negative numbers to indicate the direction of travel as depicted in the sketch below.</div>
