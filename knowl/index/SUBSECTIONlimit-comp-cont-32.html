<div class="para"> The concept of <dfn class="terminology">continuity</dfn> is essential to Calculus, but you may have noticed that we have carefully avoided it as much as possible until now. This is because defining continuity is similar to defining the line tagent to a curve (<a href="CHAPTERPTERVelocitySlopeTangent.html#DEFINITIONTangentLine" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/xref/DEFINITIONTangentLine.html" data-reveal-label="Reveal" data-close-label="Close" title="Definition 5.7: The Line Tangent to a Curve  at a Point">DefinitionÂ 5.7</a>). We need to think carefully about what we want the term <dfn class="terminology">continuous</dfn> to mean, and then craft our definition to capture that meaning. This would have been very difficult to do without a fairly sophisticated understanding of the limit concept.</div>
