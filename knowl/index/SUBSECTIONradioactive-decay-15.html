<div class="introduction">
<div class="para">The Shroud of Turin, shown below, is a Christian religious relic which bears an image of a man. Some people believe it is the burial cloth of Jesus and that the image is that of Jesus himself. In <span class="process-math">\(1987\)</span> the Vatican agreed to subject pieces of the shroud to radiocarbon dating. In this problem we will recreate the computations done to determine the age of the Shroud. Let <span class="process-math">\(A=A(t)\)</span> be the amount of <span class="process-math">\(C_{14}\)</span> (in mg) at time <span class="process-math">\(t\)</span> years, where <span class="process-math">\(t=0\)</span> represents when the shroud was used.  Let <span class="process-math">\(A(0)=A_0\)</span> be the initial amount of <span class="process-math">\(C_{14}\)</span> present in the sample.</div>

The technique of carbon dating is not in dispute, but there are other issues including questions about the quality of the samples.
