<div class="para"> In this sketch the horizontal axis is time so it shows the same bouncing spring at three different times. Assume that our spring is anchored in some way at the top. When the weight of the object and the restoring force of the spring balance exactly we say that they are in equilibrium as illustrated by the leftmost spring in our sketch. <a class="external" href="https://mathshistory.st-andrews.ac.uk/Biographies/Hooke/" target="_blank">Robert Hooke</a><details class="ptx-footnote" aria-live="polite" id="SUBSECTIONsimple-harm-oscill-11-3"><summary class="ptx-footnote__number" title="Footnote 6.8"><sup> 8 </sup></summary><div class="ptx-footnote__contents" id="SUBSECTIONsimple-harm-oscill-11-3"><code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">https://mathshistory.st-andrews.ac.uk/Biographies/Hooke/</code></div></details> (1635–1703), who we encountered back in <a href="CHAPTERPTERVelocitySlopeTangent.html#SECTIONbridg-chains-telesc" class="internal" title="Section 5.10: Bridges, Chains, Domes, and Telescopes">Section 5.10</a>, was a leading elder scientist when Newton was young and a rising star in English science. Hooke was the first to show that the restoring force exerted by a spring (the force back toward equilibrium) is directly proportional to the length of its extension beyond equilibrium.  This is known today as <dfn class="terminology">Hooke’s Law for Springs</dfn> (or just <dfn class="terminology">Hooke’s Law</dfn>) and it is true whether the spring is stretched or compressed.</div>
