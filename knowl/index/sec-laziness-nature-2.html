<div class="para"> In order to apply mathematical principles to the study of physical phenomena we need to agree on some foundational assumptions which seem to govern the behavior of nature.  A fundamental tenet that scientists use is this: <em class="emphasis">Nature is lazy!</em> That is, nature optimizes. It tries to do things in the most efficient (optimal) manner possible. The most common form such <dfn class="terminology">Optimization Problems</dfn> take is to find the value of the independent variable (often denoted <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span>) which makes the dependent variable (often denoted <span class="process-math">\(y\)</span>) as large or as small as possible.</div>
