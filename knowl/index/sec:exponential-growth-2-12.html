<div class="para"> Guessing correctly means that your intuition was very good. But intuition is unconscious.  It is at least as important to understand where a good guess came from, and why it worked as it is to understand why a bad guess didn’t work.  But when you guess well it is extremely tempting to just take your good guess and run with it. This will invariably lead to confusion later. So, when you guess correctly take a few moments to think about the intuition that led you to that guess.  Bring that intuition out of your unconscious mind and into your conscious mind.  If you don’t do that your guesses are a waste of your time. % When you guess well</div>
