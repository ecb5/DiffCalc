<div class="para"> Effective guessing is a skill. You need practice to do it well and, unfortunately, you have probably not had much chance to practice that skill in the context of mathematics.  So we encourage you to guess often from now on. But be aware that making a guess is a process, not an event. If you guess wrong, which is most likely, then you have a new, related problem to think about: All of your intuition said this was a good guess.  Why didnâ€™t it work?  The answer to that question almost always gives some insight into the original problem.  Even a bad guess can be useful.</div>
