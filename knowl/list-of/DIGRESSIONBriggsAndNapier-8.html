<div class="para">A calculator is a useful tool, but only if the human operating it understands what to calculate, and why. Blind computation is pointless and wasteful. As powerful and convenient as our modern technology is, there is still no substitution for a deep understanding of basic principles.</div>
<div class="para">For example, how many baseâ€“<span class="process-math">\(10\)</span> digits long do you suppose the number <span class="process-math">\(2^{1234567890}\)</span> is? You cannot solve this by punching <span class="process-math">\(2^{1234567890}\)</span> into a calculator and counting the digits. Try it and see.  If you can solve this by punching <span class="process-math">\(2^{1234567890}\)</span> into a calculator, that just means that technology has outpaced this particular problem. In that case use a bigger exponent, say <span class="process-math">\(12345678901234567890\text{.}\)</span>
</div>
<div class="para">This feels like the sort of problem a math professor might make up just for fun (though it often feels like we do it just to torment our students), but it is not. Computer programmers routinely have to allocate space in memory to hold information. If the information being held happens to be the value of a large number like <span class="process-math">\(2^{1234567890}\)</span> the programmer will need to know how much memory space to allocate to hold the number.</div></article><span class="incontext"><a class="internal" href="SECTIONgener-logar-expon.html#DIGRESSIONBriggsAndNapier-8">in-context</a></span>
