<div class="para">It is a well worn truism among research mathematicians that the first solution of a substantial problem is frequently both very hard to understand and very hard to convey to others, even to other mathematicians. We publish our solutions, in part, so that others can look at the problem, consider the approach used,  and find simplifications that the original investigator missed.</div>
<div class="para">This is what happened to Napier. Although his original scheme allowed him to convert multiplication to addition it was more complicated than necessary.  Shortly after Napier published his work in <span class="process-math">\(1614\text{,}\)</span> <a class="external" href="https://mathshistory.st-andrews.ac.uk/Biographies/Briggs/" target="_blank">Henry Briggs</a><details class="ptx-footnote" aria-live="polite" id="DIGRESSIONBriggsAndNapier-3-3"><summary class="ptx-footnote__number" title="Footnote 8.16"><sup> 16 </sup></summary><div class="ptx-footnote__contents" id="DIGRESSIONBriggsAndNapier-3-3"><code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">https://mathshistory.st-andrews.ac.uk/Biographies/Briggs/</code></div></details> (1561–1630), Professor of Geometry at Gresham College in London, visited Napier and suggested that a few simple changes to his logarithm table would make it more practical. In particular it was Briggs who suggested that since our number system is in base–<span class="process-math">\(10\text{,}\)</span> creating a table of base-<span class="process-math">\(10\)</span> logarithms might be more useful.</div>
<div class="para"> Napier had had the same idea himself, but was unable to pursue it “on account of ill-health.” As a result, Briggs took on the task of computing tables of base–<span class="process-math">\(10\)</span> logarithms, collaborating with Napier until the latter’s death two years later. The results of their collaboration are known as the Briggsian or <dfn class="terminology">Common Logarithms</dfn>. Common Logarithms are the base <span class="process-math">\(10\)</span> logarithms we discussed earlier and were an important computational aid for nearly <span class="process-math">\(400\)</span> years until the invention of modern computational technologies.</div>
<div class="para">As the mathematical historian Howard Eves put it, the invention of (common) logarithms literally “doubled the life of the astronomer,” because they so drastically reduced the time spent doing arithmetic.</div>
<div class="para"> Most modern scientific calculators have both the natural and the common logarithms built in.  The “<dfn class="terminology">ln</dfn>” button on a calculator computes natural logarithms while the “<dfn class="terminology">log</dfn>” computes common logarithms.</div>

<div class="para">A calculator is a useful tool, but only if the human operating it understands what to calculate, and why. Blind computation is pointless and wasteful.

If you can solve this by punching <span class="process-math">\(2^{1234567890}\)</span> into a calculator, that just means that technology has outpaced this particular problem.

<div class="para">This feels like the sort of problem a math professor might make up just for fun (though it often feels like we do it just to torment our students), but it is not.
