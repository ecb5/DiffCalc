<div class="para">We will pause here for a moment to take explicit notice of the notational convenience we used in part (a) of <a href="SECTIONsome-rules-diff.html#PROBLEMCircleDifferential" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/xref/PROBLEMCircleDifferential.html" data-reveal-label="Reveal" data-close-label="Close" title="Problem 4.3.11">Problem 4.3.11</a> because it will be useful later.  We have used the expression <span class="process-math">\(\dx{x}\)</span> to represent an infinitesimal displacement of <span class="process-math">\(x\text{,}\)</span> but it will be useful to think of the “<span class="process-math">\(\dx{ }\)</span>” as meaningful in itself. That is, in the expression <span class="process-math">\(\dx(\pi
r^2)\)</span> we think of the “d” as “operating on” the expression <span class="process-math">\(\pi r^2.\)</span> Thus when <span class="process-math">\(\dx{}\)</span> “operates on” the expression <span class="process-math">\(\pi r^2\)</span> it returns the expression <span class="process-math">\(2\pi r\dx{r}\)</span> and we have <span class="process-math">\(\dx{A}=\dx(\pi r^2) = 2\pi r \dx{r}.\)</span> This is actually consistent with our previous usage if we think of <span class="process-math">\(\dx(A)\)</span> as “operating on” the area <span class="process-math">\(A\)</span> and returning the differential <span class="process-math">\(\dx{A}.\)</span>
</div>
<div class="para">This is akin to the way we think about the square root symbol. The symbol <span class="process-math">\(\sqrt{\phantom{4}}\)</span> “operates on” the expression underneath it so we have <span class="process-math">\(\sqrt{4}=2.\)</span> Just as <span class="process-math">\(\sqrt{\phantom{4}}\)</span> is always reserved for the square root <em class="emphasis">of some quantity</em>, <span class="process-math">\(\dx{}\)</span> is always reserved for the differential <em class="emphasis">of some quantity</em>. In both cases the quantity needs to be named. It is as meaningless to write <span class="process-math">\(\pi r^2\dx{}\)</span> as it is to write <span class="process-math">\(\pi r^2\sqrt{\phantom{4}}.\)</span> It is important to use the notation as it was designed to be used.</div>
<div class="para">Also, notice that on the left side of <span class="process-math">\(\dx{A}=\dx(\pi
r^2) = 2\pi r \dx{r}\)</span> we have the infinitesimal quantity, <span class="process-math">\(\dx{A}\text{.}\)</span>  Since the two sides of the equation are equal it follows that the quantity on the right side is also an infinitesimal. The obvious conclusion is that the ordinary real number <span class="process-math">\(2\pi r\)</span> multiplied by the infinitesimal <span class="process-math">\(\dx{r}\)</span> must result in an infinitesimal quantity. Dividing both sides by <span class="process-math">\(\dx{r}\)</span> we have <span class="process-math">\(\dfdx{A}{r}=2\pi r\text{,}\)</span> which seems to indicate that the quotient of two differentials will be an ordinary real number. Does this make intuitive sense to you?</div>
<div class="para">Notice that we asked if it makes <em class="emphasis">intuitive</em> sense. When working with differentials it frequently happens that a statement feels right (makes intuitive sense) but begins to fall apart when examined more carefully.</div>
