<div class="para">No, really.  Guessing can be surprisingly effective.</div>
<div class="para">You know this of course. You’ve been doing it all of your life, but in the past — especially in math classes — guessing was probably discouraged so you tend to deny doing it, possibly even to yourself. It’s OK. Guess anyway. We won’t tell anyone.</div>
<div class="para">The fact is that guessing is a tried and true solution technique and we encourage you to use it regularly.  Guessing is nothing more, or less, than relying on your native intuition.</div>
<div class="para">But effective guessing is a skill. You need practice to do it well and, unfortunately, you have probably not had much chance to practice that skill in the context of mathematics.  So we encourage you to guess often from now on. But be aware that making a guess is a process, not an event. If you guess wrong, which is most likely, then you have a new, related problem to think about: All of your intuition said this was a good guess.  Why didn’t it work?  The answer to that question almost always gives some insight into the original problem.  Even a bad guess can be useful.</div>
<div class="para">However a bad guess, indeed any guess,  in isolation is a waste of time. You must also take the time to figure out why your bad guess doesn’t work.</div>
<div class="para">But the real danger in guessing — the reason it is usually discouraged — is that when you do guess correctly, or nearly so, it is  very tempting to just move on from there. Don’t do that.</div>
<div class="para">Guessing correctly means that your intuition was very good. But intuition is unconscious.  It is at least as important to understand where a good guess came from, and why it worked as it is to understand why a bad guess didn’t work.  But when you guess well it is extremely tempting to just take your good guess and run with it. This will invariably lead to confusion later. So, when you guess correctly take a few moments to think about the intuition that led you to that guess.  Bring that intuition out of your unconscious mind and into your conscious mind.  If you don’t do that your guesses are a waste of your time.</div>
