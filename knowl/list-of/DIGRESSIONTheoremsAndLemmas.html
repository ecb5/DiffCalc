<div class="para">Technically speaking, a statement is not a theorem until it has actually been proved. Until then it is a conjecture.</div></aside><div class="para">The distinction between a theorem and a lemma is very slight and rather arbitrary. Typically we call a statement a theorem if it is important and requires proof. We call it a lemma if it requires proof itself, and is used to simplify the proof of a theorem.  This is not a hard-and-fast rule by any means. Sometimes we first prove a lemma as an aid to proving a theorem, only to find that the lemma is actually more important. However, having been originally dubbed a lemma the result is known ever after as a lemma.  For example, in the present instance we will be using the Extreme Value, and Fermat’s <em class="emphasis">Theorems</em> to prove what often called Rolle’s <em class="emphasis">Lemma</em>, and then use use Rolle’s <em class="emphasis">Lemma</em> to prove the Mean Value <em class="emphasis">Theorem</em>.  Then we will use the Mean Value <em class="emphasis">Theorem</em> to prove the First Derivative <em class="emphasis">Test</em>. It is all very chaotic.</div>
<aside class="aside aside-like"><h4 class="heading"><span class="title">Comment.</span></h4>
<div class="para">We will not be proving the Extreme Value Theorem in this text. Although it appears to be obviously true (read it again and see), it is remarkably hard to prove in a fully rigorous fashion. If you feel that you must see the proof you should change your major to mathematics and take a course in Real Analysis.</div></aside><div class="para"><em class="alert">END OF DIGRESSION</em></div></section><span class="incontext"><a class="internal" href="SECTIONrolles-lemma-mean.html#DIGRESSIONTheoremsAndLemmas">in-context</a></span>
