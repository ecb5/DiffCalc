<div class="para logical">
<div class="para">It is easy to have the impression that using a letter, like <span class="process-math">\(s\text{,}\)</span> to represent quantity automatically means that the quantity can vary — that it is “variable.” This is not true.  There are three situations in which a letter is used to represent a given quantity.</div>
<dl class="description-list">
<dt>Variables:</dt>
<dd><div class="para"> For example, the area of a square is given by <span class="process-math">\(A=x^2,\)</span> where <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> is the length of one side. If we think of <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> as a <dfn class="terminology">variable</dfn> — if it can take on any positive value — then this expression gives us the area of all possible squares.</div></dd>
<dt>Constants:</dt>
<dd>
<div class="para">Sometimes letters are used to designate unchanging quantities — <dfn class="terminology">constants</dfn> (also called <dfn class="terminology">parameters</dfn>) — when the actual value of the constant is irrelevant. For example, the area of all rectangles where one side is some fixed value, say <span class="process-math">\(c\text{,}\)</span> but the other varies is given by <span class="process-math">\(A = c\cdot
x,\)</span> where <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> is variable as before. Since we don’t care what the size of the fixed side is we don’t choose a specific length for it. We just let <span class="process-math">\(c\)</span> represent that fixed size, whatever it is.  The crucial fact here is that we have a rectangle, not what size the rectangle is.</div>
<div class="para">The difference between <dfn class="terminology">variables</dfn> and <dfn class="terminology">constants</dfn> is mostly in the way we think about them. Constants are fixed, but unknown. Variables are not fixed.</div>
</dd>
<dt>Functions:</dt>
<dd>
<div class="para logical">
<div class="para"> Sometimes a varying quantity depends on the values of one or more other varying quantities. In that case the dependent variable is said to be a <dfn class="terminology">function</dfn> of the independent variable. We saw this above when we said the area of a rectangle with a fixed side length, <span class="process-math">\(c\text{,}\)</span> was</div>
<div class="displaymath process-math">
\begin{equation*}
A=c\cdot x.
\end{equation*}
</div>
<div class="para">Most often we would write this as</div>
<div class="displaymath process-math">
\begin{equation*}
A(x)=c\cdot x.
\end{equation*}
</div>
<div class="para">The “<span class="process-math">\((x)\)</span>” part of “<span class="process-math">\(A(x)\)</span>” just tells us that that the dependent variable <span class="process-math">\(A\)</span> depends on is the independent variable <span class="process-math">\(x\text{.}\)</span>
</div>
</div>
<div class="para">If you are inclined to be persnickety, you can make a reasonable argument that if <span class="process-math">\(A(x)=cx\)</span> then <span class="process-math">\(A\)</span> depends on both <span class="process-math">\(c\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(x\text{.}\)</span> And you’d be right. But the tradition is to only put variables inside the parentheses, not parameters.</div>
</dd>
</dl>
<div class="para">These are simple distinctions now, but it will be useful for you to get in the habit of making sure it is clear in your mind what is variable, what is constant, and which variables are functions of other variables. As the problems get more complex and we need several variables, parameters, and functions, just untangling all of this can become problematic. Keep in mind that the distinction is purely in how we choose to “think about” a given symbol, not in how we manipulate it algebraically.</div>

This says that <span class="process-math">\(-s\lt x\lt\infty\text{.}\)</span> (In theory, we can make the lengths of the base as long as we wish.)
