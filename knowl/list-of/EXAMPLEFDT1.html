<div class="para">For this example we strongly suggest that you do not graph the objective functions first. Yes, we know this goes directly against our previous advice to always visualize your problem when you can, but one purpose of this section is for you to learn to analyze a problem using only your Calculus tools. Much as an airline pilot must train to fly using only the cockpit instruments in case poor visibility gives them no other choice, you should also practice “flying blind” so you can be successful even when you are not able to draw a useful graph.  You will learn more, and you will learn better, that way.</div>
<div class="para">Of course, once we’ve moved beyond this section you should visualize your problem if you possibly can. We weren’t kidding about that. You don’t want to fly blind, you just need to be able to when it is necessary.</div>
<div class="para">From the information gathered in <a href="SECTIONconc-second-deriv-1.html#DRILLO1O2" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/xref/DRILLO1O2.html" data-reveal-label="Reveal" data-close-label="Close" title="Problem 9.6.1.4">Problem 9.6.1.4</a> can we conclude that either <span class="process-math">\(O_1(x)\)</span> or <span class="process-math">\(O_2(x)\)</span> has a global maximum at <span class="process-math">\(x=-1\)</span> and a global minimum at <span class="process-math">\(x=1\text{?}\)</span>
</div>
<div class="para">No we can’t.  They both have local maxima and minima at those points since both functions increase on <span class="process-math">\((-\infty,-1)\text{,}\)</span> decrease on <span class="process-math">\((-1,1)\text{,}\)</span> and then increase again on <span class="process-math">\((1,\infty)\text{.}\)</span> But from the information we have gathered so far we can’t tell if the graph of either function rises above its value at <span class="process-math">\(x=-1\)</span> or drops below its value at <span class="process-math">\(x=1\)</span> .</div>
<div class="para">When we analyze <span class="process-math">\(O_1(x)\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(O_2(x)\)</span> using the <a href="SUBSECTIONoptim-abstr-probl.html#THEOREMFDT" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/xref/THEOREMFDT.html" data-reveal-label="Reveal" data-close-label="Close" title="Theorem 9.5.2.2: The First Derivative Test">First Derivative Test 9.5.2.2</a> we get exactly the same information from both functions. But they are very different functions. In particular, <span class="process-math">\(O_1(x)\)</span> does not have any global extrema, while <span class="process-math">\(O_2(x)\)</span> has both a global maximum and a global minimum. Graph them now and see.</div>
<div class="para">To distinguish, analytically, between <span class="process-math">\(O_1(x)\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(O_2(x)\)</span> we will need a new tool called the Second Derivative Test.</div>
<div class="para">But before we leave this example we need to address a small issue with our language.  The phrase “<span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> gets farther from zero in the positive (or negative) direction so does <span class="process-math">\(O_1(x)\)</span>” is both awkward and a bit imprecise for our purposes.  In the future we will usually abbreviate this as: “as <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> goes to positive (or negative) infinity, <span class="process-math">\(O_1(x)\)</span> also goes to positive (or negative) infinity.”</div>
<div class="para">Do not invest too much in these phrases.  They cannot possibly mean what they pretend to mean. “Infinity” is neither a number nor a place so it is meaningless to say that <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> “goes to” infinity. Think of this phrasing as a kind of verbal shorthand, or notation.</div></article><span class="incontext"><a class="internal" href="SECTIONconc-second-deriv-1.html#EXAMPLEFDT1">in-context</a></span>
