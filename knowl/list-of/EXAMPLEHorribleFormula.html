<div class="para logical">
<div class="para">For example, suppose you were asked to solve the following equation for <span class="process-math">\(x\text{:}\)</span>
</div>
<div class="displaymath process-math">
\begin{equation*}
\frac{\frac{\pi x}{\sqrt{(28-\sqrt[3]{26})^{\frac{1}{3}}}}}{\pi^2-\sqrt{3}}
- \sqrt[21]{2^{\frac{11}{2}}}= (\pi^3-\sqrt{2})x.
\end{equation*}
</div>
<div class="para">At first glance this looks horribly complicated.  But look at it again.  On the right the coefficient of <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> is <span class="process-math">\(\pi^3-\sqrt{2}\text{.}\)</span> That’s just a number. It is approximately <span class="process-math">\(29.6\)</span> but who cares? For purposes of algebraically isolating <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> all we need to know is that it is a number. Rather than calling it <span class="process-math">\(\pi^3-\sqrt{2}\text{,}\)</span> let’s just call it something simple, like <span class="process-math">\(A\text{.}\)</span> Think of it as giving the expression <span class="process-math">\(\pi^3-\sqrt{2}\)</span> a nickname; something shorter, and easier to remember.</div>
</div>
<div class="para logical">
<div class="para">If we make that substitution our equation is now</div>
<div class="displaymath process-math">
\begin{equation*}
\frac{\frac{\pi x}{\sqrt{(28-\sqrt[3]{26})^{\frac{1}{3}}}}}{\pi^2-\sqrt{3}}
- \sqrt[21]{2^{\frac{11}{2}}}= Ax.
\end{equation*}
</div>
<div class="para">which is a bit “easier on the eyes.”</div>
</div>
<div class="para logical">
<div class="para">But wait. The expression <span class="process-math">\(\sqrt[21]{2^{\frac{11}{2}}}\)</span> is also just a number. Let’s make it “easier on the eyes,” too. If we let <span class="process-math">\(B=\sqrt[21]{2^{\frac{11}{2}}}\)</span> we have</div>
<div class="displaymath process-math">
\begin{equation*}
\frac{\frac{\pi x}{\sqrt{(28-\sqrt[3]{26})^{\frac{1}{3}}}}}{\pi^2-\sqrt{3}}
- B= Ax.
\end{equation*}
</div>
<div class="para">which is even easier to look at. By now you see where this is going. If we let <span class="process-math">\(C=\frac{\frac{\pi}{\sqrt{(28-\sqrt[3]{26})^{\frac{1}{3}}}}}{\pi^2-\sqrt{3}}\)</span> then our equation is <span class="process-math">\(Cx-B=Ax\)</span> which is much “easier on the eyes” than the original equation was. In fact, we can now see that this is really a very simple equation and the solution is <span class="process-math">\(x=\frac{B}{C-A}\text{.}\)</span> Of course we inserted <span class="process-math">\(A\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(B\text{,}\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(C\)</span> into the problem so now we need to unwind our substitutions. When we do that we get</div>
<div class="displaymath process-math">
\begin{equation*}
x=\frac{\sqrt[21]{2^{\frac{11}{2}}}}{\frac{\frac{\pi}{\sqrt{(28-\sqrt[3]{26})^{\frac{1}{3}}}}}{\pi^2-\sqrt{3}}
- (\pi^3-\sqrt{2})}.
\end{equation*}

<div class="para">If a decimal number is required we could enter this formula into whatever computational tool we’re using. Good luck with that.</div>
