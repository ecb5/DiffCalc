\begin{align*}
O(x) = x^2, \amp{}\amp{} -1\le x\le 2.

<div class="para">From the graph below we can see that this function has a global minimum at <span class="process-math">\((0,0)\text{.}\)</span> We can find this minimum by the methods we are already familiar with.  But it also has a local maximum at <span class="process-math">\((-1,1)\)</span> and global maximum at <span class="process-math">\((2,4)\text{,}\)</span> and nothing we’ve done so far would identify these two points as possible extrema.</div>
</div>
<div class="image-box" style="width: 30%; margin-left: 35%; margin-right: 35%;"><img src="external/DC/ObjSqr.png" class="contained"></div>
<div class="para">It is clear from the graph what is happening, though. If we hadn’t restricted the domain of our function then the graph would continue to rise on both sides and there would be no local or global maximum at all.  The restriction on the domain forces the graph to stop rising at the endpoints of the interval which makes each of these endpoints a local maximum.</div>
<div class="para">Thus we see that when the domain of our function is a closed interval there is also the possibility that a local or global extremum might occur at the endpoints of the interval as well. As a result, when searching for extrema we must always check the endpoints of the domain interval (if there are any).</div>
<div class="para">To be clear, the end points of a closed interval are not transition points because there can be no transition between increasing and decreasing at an endpoint. It simply stops. However, since it is possible to have extrema at the endpoints they must also be checked whenever they are in play.</div>
<div class="para">Be careful. When the domain of a function is artificially constrained like this it is easy to forget that the constraint is present. We tend to think of it as “not really there.”  This is a mistake. Recall from <a href="SECTIONinverse-tan-and-cot.html#DIGRESSIONTangentHasNoInverse" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/xref/DIGRESSIONTangentHasNoInverse.html" data-reveal-label="Reveal" data-close-label="Close" title="Digression: DIGRESSION: The Tangent Function Has No Inverse">Digression: The Tangent Function Has No Inverse</a> that the definition of the domain is a part of the definition of a function. Think of the function’s domain as the “universe” for that particular problem. Nothing exists outside of the domain. Thus in this example nothing exists outside of the interval (universe) <span class="process-math">\([-1,2]\text{.}\)</span>
