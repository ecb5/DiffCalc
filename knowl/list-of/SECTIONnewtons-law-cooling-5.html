<div class="para">The  rule of thumb forensic scientist use to  determine at person’s the time of death is to start with a body temperature of <span class="process-math">\(37^\circ C\)</span> and subtract <span class="process-math">\(1.5^\circ C\)</span> for each hour the person is dead.  Of course, this simple linear model isn’t as accurate as Newton’s Law of Cooling since it does not take into account the surrounding temperature, size of the body, etc. and can only be applied until the temperature of the body reaches the surrounding temperature.</div>

<div class="para">Suppose the ambient temperature is <span class="process-math">\(20^\circ C.\)</span> Using the forensic rule of thumb, how long would it take for the body to reach the ambient temperature?  Using the forensic rule of thumb, what would the body temperature be halfway through the cooling process.</div></article><article class="task exercise-like"><h5 class="heading"><span class="codenumber">(b)</span></h5>
<div class="para">Use the temperature predicted by the rule of thumb at the halfway point to give a complete model of the body’s cooling as predicted by Newton’s Law of Cooling.</div></article><article class="task exercise-like"><h5 class="heading"><span class="codenumber">(c)</span></h5>
<div class="para">Of course, in Newton’s Law of Cooling, the body temperature will never quite reach the ambient temperature, but just for comparison, substitute the time when the rule of thumb predicts that the body temperature is <span class="process-math">\(20^\circ C\)</span> and see how close it is to the ambient temperature.</div></article><article class="task exercise-like"><h5 class="heading"><span class="codenumber">(d)</span></h5>
<div class="para">Using the answer you obtained in part (c), find the rate of change of the body temperature at the beginning of the time interval and the rate of change of the body temperature at the end of the time interval.  How do these compare with the rule of thumb rate of change?</div></article></article><span class="incontext"><a class="internal" href="SECTIONLogApps.html#SECTIONnewtons-law-cooling-5">in-context</a></span>
