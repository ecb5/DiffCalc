<div class="introduction"><div class="para">The radioactive isotope Potassium–<span class="process-math">\(40\)</span> <span class="process-math">\((K_{40})\)</span> has a half life of <span class="process-math">\(1.25\)</span> billion years. Radiometric dating using <span class="process-math">\(K_{40}\)</span> is especially effective for dating very old volcanic rock as the quickly cooling lava traps the Argon formed by the decaying of <span class="process-math">\(K_{40}.\)</span> This has been used by scientists to study the frequency of geomagnetic reversals.  A geomagnetic reversal is a change in the earth’s magnetic polarity where the magnetic north and south poles (not to be confused with the geographic north and south poles) are switched. The latest such reversal is called the <a class="external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brunhes%E2%80%93Matuyama_reversal" target="_blank">Brunhes-Matuyama</a><details class="ptx-footnote" aria-live="polite" id="SUBSECTIONradioactive-decay-18-1-1-9"><summary class="ptx-footnote__number" title="Footnote 8.14"><sup> 14 </sup></summary><div class="ptx-footnote__contents" id="SUBSECTIONradioactive-decay-18-1-1-9"><code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brunhes%E2%80%93Matuyama_reversal</code></div></details> reversal. Basically, the magnetic polarity of the planet is “recorded” in cooled lava flows.  By dating the age of the lava flows, scientists can date these reversals. There are limitations to this dating method, as the smallest percentage of <span class="process-math">\(K_{40}\)</span> that can be detected is about <span class="process-math">\(0.0053\%\text{.}\)</span>

<div class="para">According to the Wikipedia article we referenced above the the Brunhes–Matuyama reversal occured approximately <span class="process-math">\(781,000\)</span> years ago. A rock sample which appears to have a magnetic reversal  contains between <span class="process-math">\(99.9541\%\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(99.9593\%\)</span> of the <span class="process-math">\(K_{40}\)</span> that it originally contained. Is this consistent with the Brunhes–Matuyama reversal?</div></article><article class="task exercise-like"><h5 class="heading"><span class="codenumber">(b)</span></h5>
