This is one of the things that makes it difficult to read mathematics. We routinely co-opt words from natural languages (like English) and redefine them to fit our needs. In this case our purpose requires that we change the definition of “near” slightly as you’ve seen.  Because “near” is a common word and you have a lifetime of experience using it, it can be very difficult to cast off your preconceptions.  The familiar definition you learned in childhood will intrude and cause confusion. It is hard to overcome this. Refer back to the definition frequently until you have internalized the mathematical definition.  } <span class="process-math">\(x=a\)</span> if <span class="process-math">\(f(x)\)</span> has that property on an open interval about <span class="process-math">\(x=a\text{,}\)</span> except possibly at <span class="process-math">\(a\)</span> itself.</div></article><span class="incontext"><a class="internal" href="CHAPTERdiff-rules-with-limits.html#DEFINITIONnear">in-context</a></span>
