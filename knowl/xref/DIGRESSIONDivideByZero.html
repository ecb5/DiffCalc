<div class="para">In <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/xref/DRILLZeroDenominator1.html" title="Drill 5.16">Drill 5.16</a> it is tempting to to say that <span class="process-math">\(\dfdx{y}{x}=\frac{3x^2-3}{2y}\)</span> will give us the slope of the tangent line tangent to the curve at <em class="emphasis">any</em> point <span class="process-math">\((x,y).\)</span> Typically this would be correct.  But not always. For example  the tangent line of this curve  is horizontal (has slope equal to zero) when</div>
<div class="displaymath process-math" data-contains-math-knowls="./knowl/xref/DRILLZeroDenominator1.html">
\begin{equation*}
0=\dfdx{y}{x}=\frac{3x^2-3}{2y}.
\end{equation*}
</div>
</div>        <div class="para">Solving this gives <span class="process-math">\(x=\pm1\text{.}\)</span> It is plainly visible on the graph below that there is a horizontal tangent line when <span class="process-math">\(x=-1\text{.}\)</span>  But notice that there is no point on the graph where <span class="process-math">\(x=1\text{!}\)</span>  Obviously it is meaningless to ask for the slope of a curve at a point that isn’t on the curve.</div> <div class="image-box" style="width: 40%; margin-left: 30%; margin-right: 30%;"><img src="external/images/EllipticCurve2.png" class="contained"></div> <div class="para">Even if we didn’t have the graph to look at we could still tell that at <span class="process-math">\(x=1\)</span> there is no tangent line.  Setting <span class="process-math">\(x=1\)</span> and trying to solve for the corresponding <span class="process-math">\(y\)</span> values we get <span class="process-math">\(y^2=1-3+1=-1\text{.}\)</span> Since there is no real number that satisfies the equation <span class="process-math">\(y^2=-1\)</span> we conclude that there is no point on the graph with <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span>-coordinate equal to <span class="process-math">\(1\text{.}\)</span>
</div> <div class="para">On the other hand, there are three values of <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> that correspond to <span class="process-math">\(y=0\text{.}\)</span>  These would be difficult to compute but from the graph we can see that the tangent line is most likely vertical at all three points. To compute <span class="process-math">\(\dfdx{y}{x}=\frac{3x^2-3}{2y}\)</span> at each of these points we would have to divide by <span class="process-math">\(y=0\text{.}\)</span>
</div> <div class="para">Obviously when we divide a number by zero we get infinity, and just as obviously the slope of a vertical line is also infinity so everything fits. Right? No, of course not. This is just a very deceptive coincidence.</div> <div class="para">Many students come into a Calculus with the impression that dividing by zero results in either zero or infinity.  It does not. Division by zero is not meaningful.</div> <div class="para">Mathematicians say that division by zero is an <dfn class="terminology">undefined operation</dfn> or simply that it is <dfn class="terminology">undefined</dfn>. At first it is not at all clear why this is, so let’s take look at this question.</div> <aside class="aside aside-like"><h5 class="heading"><span class="title">Comment.</span></h5>
<div class="para">The units could be inches, picometers, or light-years. We don’t care.</div></aside> <div class="para">What does it mean to divide by any number? To take a very concrete example, what does it mean to divide a length of five units by seventeen? It means we want to divide the length into seventeen equally sized pieces, right?  But if we want to divided <span class="process-math">\(5\)</span> units by zero, obviously we can’rsq/&gt;t divide five into zero pieces. So in this very concrete example the phrase “five divided by zero” is simply and utterly without meaning.</div> <div class="para">From a slightly more abstract viewpoint we could ask for the length of each piece when we divide a length of five into seventeen pieces. We get <span class="process-math">\(\frac{5}{17}\)</span> of course. That’rsq/&gt;s what the fraction notation means</div> <aside class="aside aside-like"><h5 class="heading"><span class="title">Comment.</span></h5>
<div class="para">Just as <span class="process-math">\(\frac12\)</span> is the number we get when we divide one into two pieces.</div></aside> <div class="para">But what number do we get when we divide five into zero pieces. Once again the idea has no meaning.</div> <div class="para">Taking an even more abstract point of view,  observe that multiplication and division are inverse operations (they undo each other). Twelve divided by three is four <span class="process-math">\(\left(\frac{12}{3}=4\right)\)</span> precisely because when we multiply three times four we get twelve (<span class="process-math">\(3\times 4 =12\)</span>).</div> <div class="para">Now don’t think of five as a length to be divided, think of it instead as simply a number. So what number can we multiply by zero to get five? Obviously there isn’t any such number so this is a meaningless question.</div> <div class="para">No matter what we try or how we look at it we cannot find any way to make  division by zero meaningful.</div> <div class="para">Since we can’t divide by zero we will need to be a bit more careful about how we interpret the symbol <span class="process-math">\(\dfdx{y}{x}\text{.}\)</span> It will give us the slope of the curve (equivalently, the slope of the tangent line) as long as <span class="process-math">\(\dfdx{y}{x}\)</span> has meaning. But when <span class="process-math">\(y\)</span> is zero <span class="process-math">\(\dfdx{y}{x}=\frac{3x^2-3}{2y}\)</span> is meaningless.  Thus it appears that for this particular curve we can draw no conclusions whatsoever from our formula about the tangent line when <span class="process-math">\(y=0\text{.}\)</span> In this case we say that the differential quotient is <dfn class="terminology">undefined</dfn>. In general, the differential quotient is <dfn class="terminology">undefined</dfn> at any point where evaluating <span class="process-math">\(\dfdx{y}{x}\)</span> requires a division by zero.</div> <div class="para">Does this mean we can draw no conclusions at all? Certainly not. In fact those values of <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> or <span class="process-math">\(y\)</span> where <span class="process-math">\(\dfdx{y}{x}\)</span> is undefined will often turn out to be the most useful. But we are not yet quite prepared to see how to deal with them properly so we will defer this discussion until a later point.</div> <div class="para">At the very least this warns us that there are subtleties that must be dealt with when using a powerful tool like Calculus. We will avoid these subtleties for a bit longer, but you need to know that they exist. Don’t try to force matters by, for example, blindly dividing by zero as if it is meaningful. We will return to these matters when we have a better understanding of the underlying principles.</div> <div class="para"><em class="alert">END OF DIGRESSION</em></div></section><span class="incontext"><a class="internal" href="CHAPTERPTERVelocitySlopeTangent.html#DIGRESSIONDivideByZero">in-context</a></span>
