<div class="para">\setcounter{TmpCtr1}{\value{myexample}} The previous example was fairly simple so it was easy to keep all of the important information in mind at the same time. This will not always be the case so we will need ways to organize the data we collect. This will ensure that it is not overwhelming.  Below we demonstrate one way to do this. It is not the only way. Let’s sketch the graph of</div>
<div class="displaymath process-math" data-contains-math-knowls="  ./knowl/xref/SECTIONhoriz-asympt-as.html">
\begin{equation*}
y=\frac{2+2x^2+2x^4}{1+x^4}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<div class="para">using Calculus.   To use the First Derivative Test we’ll need  the derivative. \begin{ProficiencyDrill-1line} Confirm that the derivative is <span class="process-math">\(\dfdx{y}{x} =y^\prime(x)= \frac{4x(1-x^4)}{(1+x^4)^2}
\text{.}\)</span> \end{ProficiencyDrill-1line} Setting the first derivative equal to zero and solving we see that we have a POTP at <span class="process-math">\(x=-1\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(x=0\text{,}\)</span> and at <span class="process-math">\(x=1\text{.}\)</span>  To make all of this easier to see we arrange this data in the following table.  Notice that we have organized our POTPs (and hence the intervals that we are testing) from left to right, just as they would appear on a number line. \begin{center} \begin{tabular}[h]{|c||c|c|c|c|c|c|c|}\hline POTP  \amp              \amp <span class="process-math">\(-1\)</span>                     \amp            \amp <span class="process-math">\(0\)</span>                      \amp            \amp  <span class="process-math">\(1\)</span>\amp            \bigstrut \hline Interval    \amp <span class="process-math">\((\infty,-1)\)</span>\amp                          \amp <span class="process-math">\((-1,0)\)</span>   \amp                          \amp <span class="process-math">\((0,1)\)</span>    \amp     \amp <span class="process-math">\((1,\infty)\)</span> \bigstrut \hline\hline <span class="process-math">\(y^\prime(x)\)</span>\amp <span class="process-math">\(\gt 0\)</span>     \amp                          \amp <span class="process-math">\(\lt 0\)</span>   \amp                          \amp <span class="process-math">\(\gt 0\)</span>   \amp                         \amp <span class="process-math">\(\lt 0\)</span>\bigstrut <span class="process-math">\(y(t)\)</span>          \amp  <span class="process-math">\(\nearrow\)</span> \amp <span class="process-math">\(3\)</span>                         \amp  <span class="process-math">\(\searrow\)</span>\amp <span class="process-math">\(2\)</span>                         \amp  <span class="process-math">\(\nearrow\)</span>\amp  <span class="process-math">\(3\)</span>                        \amp  <span class="process-math">\(\searrow\)</span> \bigstrut \amp             \amp \rotatebox{90}{{\tiny {\tiny local max}}}\amp            \amp \rotatebox{90}{{\tiny local min}}\amp            \amp \rotatebox{90}{{\tiny local max}}\amp \bigstrut \hline \end{tabular} \end{center} \begin{wrapfigure}[]{r}{1in} \vskip-3mm \captionsetup{labelformat=empty} \centerline{\includegraphics*[height=.4in,width=1in]{../Figures/GraphingWith11}} \label{fig:GraphingWith1} \end{wrapfigure} Based on the table above we could reasonably infer that the graph might might have the shape shown at the right. The next step is to locate this graph on the <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span>-<span class="process-math">\(y\)</span> plane. From our table above we see that the local minimum is at <span class="process-math">\(y(0)=2\text{,}\)</span> and the two local maxima are at <span class="process-math">\(y(-1)=y(1)=3\text{.}\)</span> \begin{wrapfigure}[]{l}{1.2in} \vskip-3mm \captionsetup{labelformat=empty} \centerline{\includegraphics*[height=1.2in,width=1.2in]{../Figures/GraphingWith12}} \label{fig:GraphingWith2} \end{wrapfigure} Thus we can, again reasonably, infer that the graph of <span class="process-math">\(y(x)\)</span> is located on the plane as shown at the left. Unfortunately, we don’t know that our graph is correct\aside{In fact, it is not.} because we’ve made assumptions regarding its concavity that we haven’t justified. This is the same error we made in the discussion following <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">[cross-reference to target(s) "EXAMPLEMaxTriangle" missing or not unique]</code>, back in <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">[cross-reference to target(s) "CHAPTERPTERproblem-solving" missing or not unique]</code> when we drew a right triangle because it “seemed to be” correct. It is very easy to make this sort of mistake. Be careful. We can analyze the concavity of the graph using the second derivative in a manner very similar to what we did earlier with first derivative. \begin{ProficiencyDrill-enumerate} \begin{enumerate}[label={  (\alph*)}] \item   Confirm that the second derivative of our function is: <span class="process-math">\(\dfdxn{y}{x}{2} = \frac{4(1-12x^4+3x^8)}{(1+x^4)^3}\text{.}\)</span> \item Use an appropriate computational tool, or Newton’s Method, to show that the PITPs of <span class="process-math">\(y(x)\)</span> are: <span class="process-math">\(x\approx -1.41\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(x\approx -0.54\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(x\approx 0.54 \text{,}\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(x\approx 1.41 \text{.}\)</span> \item The approximations in part (b) can actually be computed exactly. Find the exact solutions and confirm the approximations. \end{enumerate} \end{ProficiencyDrill-enumerate} Now set up a table to analyze concavity. \centerline{\includegraphics*[height=1.5in,width=5.5in]{../Figures/GraphingWith13}} \begin{wrapfigure}[]{r}{2in} \captionsetup{labelformat=empty} \centerline{\includegraphics*[height=1.2in,width=2in]{../Figures/GraphingWith14}} \label{fig:GraphingWith14} \end{wrapfigure} Combining the data in this table with the data in our previous table it would seem reasonable to infer that the graph of our function looks like the one at the right. Does this graph above seem complete to you now?  Obviously it is not, or we would not have asked, but do you see what is missing?  What happens to <span class="process-math">\(y(x)\)</span> as <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> is very far from zero either the positive or the negative direction? Does <span class="process-math">\(y(x)\)</span> continue to drop? Or does it eventually level off? We’re not quite ready to talk about this yet, so give it some thought and take you best guess. We’ll come back and finish this example in <a href="CHAPTERlimits-lhop-rule.html#SECTIONhoriz-asympt-as" class="internal" title='Section 12.1: Horizontal Asymptotes as Limits "at Infinity"'>~ 12.1</a> after we’ve developed some essential notation and definitions.</div>
