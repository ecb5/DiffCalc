<div class="para"> To get a sense of how we will be using differentials consider the line which is the graph of the equation <span class="process-math">\(3x+2y=5\text{.}\)</span> Let’s differentiate both sides of this formula using the tools we have so far. Obviously if two quantities are equal then their differentials are also equal. So,</div>
