<div class="para">Out of all rectangles with a given fixed perimeter, which one encompasses the greatest area?</div>
<div class="para">A reasonable guess is that the correct shape is a square. But a guess, no matter how much it feels right, is just a guess. We need a convincing demonstration.</div>
<div class="para logical">
<div class="para">To see that this actually is the correct shape, consider a square whose side is <span class="process-math">\(s\text{.}\)</span> If <span class="process-math">\(s\)</span> is the length of one side then the perimeter of our square is (the fixed value) <span class="process-math">\(4s\)</span> and the area is <span class="process-math">\(s^2\)</span> (also fixed). Suppose we now increase the length of one of the two pairs of opposite sides by <span class="process-math">\(x\text{.}\)</span> To maintain the same perimeter, we must also decrease the length of the other pair of sides by the same <span class="process-math">\(x\text{.}\)</span> The area of this new rectangle is</div>
<div class="displaymath process-math">
\begin{equation*}
(s-x)(s+x)=s^2-x^2\lt{}s^2
\end{equation*}
</div>
<div class="para">but its perimeter is still <span class="process-math">\(4s\text{.}\)</span>
</div>
</div>
<div class="para">Thus the <span class="process-math">\(s\times s\)</span> square has a larger area than the  <span class="process-math">\((s-x) \times (s+x)\)</span> rectangle with the same perimeter. Moreover, since we didnâ€™t specify a value for <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> our conclusion holds for all possible values of <span class="process-math">\(x\text{.}\)</span> That is, every rectangle with perimeter <span class="process-math">\(4s\)</span> has a smaller area than the square with perimeter <span class="process-math">\(4s\text{.}\)</span>
