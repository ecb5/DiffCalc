</h5> <div class="para">Out of all rectangles with a given fixed perimeter, which one encompasses the greatest area?</div> <div class="para">A reasonable guess is that the correct shape is a square. But a guess, no matter how much it feels right, is just a guess. We need a convincing demonstration.</div> <div class="para">To see that this actually is the correct shape, consider a square whose side is <span class="process-math">\(s.\)</span> If <span class="process-math">\(s\)</span> is the length of one side then the perimeter of our square is (the fixed value) <span class="process-math">\(4s\)</span> and the area is <span class="process-math">\(s^2\)</span> (also fixed). Suppose we now increase of two opposite sides the length by <span class="process-math">\(x.\)</span> To maintain the same perimeter, we must now decrease the width by the same <span class="process-math">\(x.\)</span> The area of this new rectangle is <span class="process-math">\((s-x) \times (s+x)\)</span> is <span class="process-math">\((s-x)(s+x)=s^2-x^2\lt{}s^2\)</span> but its perimeter is still <span class="process-math">\(4s\text{.}\)</span>
</div> <div class="para">Thus the square has a larger area than this rectangle with the same perimeter. Moreover, since we didnâ€™t specify a value for <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> our conclusion holds for all possible values of <span class="process-math">\(x\text{.}\)</span> That is, every rectangle with perimeter <span class="process-math">\(4s\)</span> has a smaller area than the square with perimeter <span class="process-math">\(4s\text{.}\)</span>
