<div class="para">Let <span class="process-math">\(O(x)=x^3-3x\text{.}\)</span>  The solutions of <span class="process-math">\(\dfdx{O}{x}=3x^2-3=0\)</span> are <span class="process-math">\(x=-1\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(x=1\)</span> so these are the POTPs.  Sketch the graph of <span class="process-math">\(O(x)\)</span> and follow along with our reasoning below, confirming our conclusions visually.</div> <div class="para">To determine if they actually are transition points we proceed as follows: \begin{description} \item[At \boldmath <span class="process-math">\(x=-1\text{:}\)</span>] Pick a number less than <span class="process-math">\(-1\text{,}\)</span> say <span class="process-math">\(x=-2.\)</span> Since <span class="process-math">\(\dfdxat{O}{x}{-2}\gt 0\)</span> we see that <span class="process-math">\(O(x)\)</span> is increasing to the left of <span class="process-math">\(x=-1.\)</span> Next pick a number between <span class="process-math">\(-1\)</span> and the next POTP, <span class="process-math">\(x=1\text{.}\)</span> We’ll take <span class="process-math">\(x=0\text{.}\)</span> Since <span class="process-math">\(\dfdxat{O}{x}{0}\lt0\)</span> we see that <span class="process-math">\(O(x)\)</span> is decreasing to the right of <span class="process-math">\(x=-1\text{.}\)</span> Thus <span class="process-math">\(O(-1) =2\)</span> is a local maximum value of <span class="process-math">\(O(x)\text{.}\)</span> \item[At \boldmath  <span class="process-math">\(x=1\text{:}\)</span>] % Pick a number between the previous As we saw above <span class="process-math">\(O(x)\)</span> is decreasing to the left of <span class="process-math">\(x=1\)</span> since <span class="process-math">\(\dfdxat{O}{x}{0}\lt0\text{.}\)</span> (Zero is between <span class="process-math">\(x=-1\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(x=1\text{.}\)</span>) Next choose any number to the right of <span class="process-math">\(x=1\text{.}\)</span> We’ll choose <span class="process-math">\(x=2\text{.}\)</span> Since <span class="process-math">\(\dfdxat{O}{x}{2}\gt0\)</span> we see that <span class="process-math">\(O(x)\)</span> is increasing to the right of <span class="process-math">\(x=1\text{.}\)</span> Thus <span class="process-math">\(O(1)=-2\)</span> is a local minimum of <span class="process-math">\(O(x)\text{.}\)</span> \end{description}</div> <div class="para">In this example we only tested one number between adjacent POTPs. Is that enough? Give this some thought before reading on.</div> <div class="para">Of course it is. Consider that the POTPs are precisely those places where <span class="process-math">\(O^\prime(x)\)</span> might change sign. Therefore the sign of <span class="process-math">\(O^\prime(x)\)</span> must either be always positive or always negative in between POTPs. Therefore, we only need to test at one value of <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> to find the sign of <span class="process-math">\(O(x)\)</span> on the entire interval between POTPs.</div> <div class="para">If <span class="process-math">\(a\)</span> is the greatest POTP we need only test the sign of one number greater than <span class="process-math">\(a\)</span> to determine the sign of <span class="process-math">\(O^\prime(x)\)</span> for every value of <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> greater than <span class="process-math">\(a\text{.}\)</span>
</div> <div class="para">Similarly, if <span class="process-math">\(a\)</span> is the least POTP we need only test the sign of one number less than <span class="process-math">\(a\)</span> to determine the sign of <span class="process-math">\(O^\prime(x)\)</span> for every value of <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> less than <span class="process-math">\(a\text{.}\)</span>
