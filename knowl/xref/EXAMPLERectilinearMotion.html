<div class="para">Suppose a point is moving in the plane so that its horizontal speed is <span class="process-math">\(1\)</span> unit per second and its vertical velocity is <span class="process-math">\(2\)</span> units per second as in the diagram at the right.

<div class="para">Observe that <span class="process-math">\(x(t) = t\)</span> is the algebraic representation of a horizontal arrow with length <span class="process-math">\(t\text{,}\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(y(t) =

<div class="para">If <span class="process-math">\(t\)</span> represents time in seconds and if the point starts at the origin, then its coordinates are given by <span class="process-math">\(x(t)=t\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(y(t)=2t\text{.}\)</span>  Since both <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(y\)</span> are needed to locate the point we will join them together notationally like this:</div>

\ParamEqTwo{x(t)}{y(t)} \)</span> there is an implicit understanding that (<span class="process-math">\(t\)</span>)ime is passing and we are thinking about the motion of the point.

</div> <div class="para">Think of the line as a road. The formula <span class="process-math">\(y=2x\)</span> describes the entire road, whereas the expression <span class="process-math">\(P(t)=

</div> <div class="para">The idea of representing velocities with arrows is quite a powerful and common technique for representing non-linear motion. Roberval used this technique to find the tangent lines of the conic sections (as we will soon see) as well as more general curves. Since Roberval’s time this idea has been developed considerably beyond what Roberval did. In fact we are skirting the edge of some very deep ideas here. In modern terms these arrows would be called <dfn class="terminology">vectors</dfn>. <dfn class="terminology">Vector Addition</dfn> is then done by the <dfn class="terminology">Parallelogram Rule</dfn>, which is essentially what we did with our arrows above: Form the parallelogram and find its diagonal.  The full force of vector analysis was not available to Roberval, and we won’t need it, so we will not take you any further down this path but we encourage you visualize velocities, and any other directed quantity, as composed of horizontal and vertical components whenever you can. You will see this representation in more detail later in your education and it will help if you have already begun thinking in these terms.</div></article><span class="incontext"><a class="internal" href="CHAPTERScienceBeforeCalc.html#EXAMPLERectilinearMotion">in-context</a></span>
