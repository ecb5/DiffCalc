As a result it is easy to get the impression that this is a a simple problem.  But, imagine yourself back in the late <span class="process-math">\(17\)</span>th century for a moment. The only computation technology available is paper and pencil. How would you solve this problem? How would you even generate an approximate solution?</div> <div class="para">One possibility is to graph <span class="process-math">\(y=x^3-3x^2\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(y=5x+6\)</span> on the same set of axes and look for the value of <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> where the two graphs intersect as in the figure above at the right. This seems like a good idea until we actually try it.  Immediately we realize that accurately graphing even simple equations would have been an almost insurmountable task in those days. We clearly used modern technology to draw the graph pictured. Drawing it by hand accurately enough to glean useful information from it would have been virtually impossible.</div> <div class="para logical">
<div class="para">Here’s another idea. If we rearrange the equation just a little we get</div>
<div class="displaymath process-math" data-contains-math-knowls="">
\begin{equation*}
x^3-3x^2-(5x+6)=0.\label{eq:NewtonMethod1}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<div class="para">Now define <span class="process-math">\(f(x)\)</span> to be the expression on the left of <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">[cross-reference to target(s) "EQUATIONNewtonMethod1" missing or not unique]</code>): <span class="process-math">\(f(x) = x^3-3x^2-(5x+6)\text{.}\)</span> The graph of this function, seen at the left, will cross the <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span>-axis (that is <span class="process-math">\(f(x)=0\)</span>) at the same <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> coordinate where the equation <span class="process-math">\(x^3-3x^2 = 5x+6\)</span> is satisfied. This simple observation allows us to think of the problem in a slightly different way: We are looking for the <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> value which is a root of the function <span class="process-math">\(f(x)\text{.}\)</span>

But it does. Now, instead of looking for both the <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(y\)</span> coordinates of an intersection point we need only  search for the  value of <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> where the graph of the function <span class="process-math">\(f(x)=x^3-3x^2-(5x+6) \)</span> crosses the <span class="process-math">\(x-\)</span>axis. This gives us just a little more information because we know that the <span class="process-math">\(y\)</span> coordinate is zero if a point is on the <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span>-axis.</div> <div class="para">As before we will need an initial guess to get started. Since the root seems to be close to <span class="process-math">\(4\)</span> we’ll use <span class="process-math">\(r_1=4\)</span> as our first approximation. Now  find and sketch the line tangent to <span class="process-math">\(f(x)\)</span> at <span class="process-math">\(r_1=4\)</span> as seen in the sketch at the left (in red). If our first guess is close to the actual root the Principle of Local Linearity guarantees that the tangent line will cross the <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span>-axis very near to the actual root.  So the value of <span class="process-math">\(x\text{,}\)</span> whatever it is, where the tangent line crosses seems like it would be a pretty good second approximation <span class="process-math">\(r_2\text{,}\)</span> of the root of <span class="process-math">\(f(x) = x^3-3x^2-(5x+6)\text{.}\)</span> If we zoom in on this part of our graph, as in the figure, this is easy to see.</div> <div class="para">Apparently all we have to do now is determine the slope of the line tangent to the graph at <span class="process-math">\(r_1= 4\text{,}\)</span> then find the equation of the line and its <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span>-intercept.</div></article><span class="incontext"><a class="internal" href="CHAPTApproximation.html#EXAMPLEnewtons-method1">in-context</a></span>
