Setting this equal to zero allows us to identify all of the events that an observer at the origin is observing at a given instant. For example, if there is a solar flare happening on the sun <span class="process-math">\(93\)</span> million miles away from the earth, then we observe it <span class="process-math">\(8\)</span> minutes later.  The spacetime distance is zero to allow for the simultaneity of the event happening and us observing it.  The closest galaxy to the Milky Way Galaxy is the Andromeda Galaxy which is approximately <span class="process-math">\(2.5\)</span> million light-years away.  This means that the light we are observing now originated 2.5 million years ago but the spacetime distance between the two events (called the <a class="external" href="https://mathshistory.st-andrews.ac.uk/Biographies/Minkowski/" target="_blank">Minkowski</a> distance) is still zero.</div></details>.</div></article><span class="incontext"><a class="internal" href="SECTIONsome-rules-diff.html#PROBLEMspacetimeJ">in-context</a></span>
