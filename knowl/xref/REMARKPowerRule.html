<div class="para">Having an irrational exponent is a bigger problem than it seems to be.  We have no way (so far) to interpret the meaning of an expression like <span class="process-math">\(x^{\sqrt{2}}\text{.}\)</span>  So trying to find its differential using the techniques we have is hopeless.  Take a moment to consider what an expression like <span class="process-math">\(x^{\sqrt{2}}\)</span> could even mean.</div>

<div class="para">Don’t keep reading as if we didn’t just tell you to stop. We’re serious. Take a moment and think about this. How do you multiply <span class="process-math">\(\sqrt{2}\)</span> copies of <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> together? Does that even mean anything? If so, what?</div></aside><div class="para">In <a href="SECTIONExponentialFunction.html" class="internal" title="Section 8.3: Exponential Growth and Exponential Notation">Section 8.3</a> we will find two different ways to assign meaning to <span class="process-math">\(x^{\alpha }\)</span> when <span class="process-math">\(\alpha{}\)</span> is irrational. (Actually, we will invent a way. Meaning is not something we find, it is something we create.) When we do we will find that the Power Rule still works.
