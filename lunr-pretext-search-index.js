  "body": " The authors wish first and foremost to express our gratitude to the students who were subjected to various rough drafts of this textbook in a classroom setting. Our intention was always to write a student-centered textbook. To whatever extent we have succeeded in achieving that goal the insights and suggestions of these students were an invaluable help and we are very grateful to them for that.  Second, we wish to thank Dr. H. Joseph Straight, Distinguished Service Professor at SUNY, Fredonia for agreeing to use some of the earlier drafts in his classes. With grace and professionalism, he guided his students through, and sometimes around, the poor organization, murky examples, and innumerable typos of these early versions, simultaneously giving us precious insights and suggestions for improvement. His comments were always on point and we are deeply appreciative of all of his efforts.  We also wish to thank Allison Brown at Milne Open Textbooks for her patience with us. We are sure that she grew very tired of getting emails from us saying that we were almost done only to find that we still had a lot more polishing to do. Through it all her support was unwavering and we are deeply indebted to her for it.  Last, but certainly not least, we wish to thank our copy editor, Dr. Margo Boman, for all of her help in getting us to the current version of this book. When we employed her in this capacity, we thought that we were nearly done. It turned out that we were sadly mistaken. Margo's attention to detail and her pedagogical expertise were instrumental in transforming a collection of stories and problems into a much more coherent and polished narrative. It was more work than both she and we anticipated, but it was worth it and we are deeply beholden to her. Future teachers and students using this book will benefit enormously from her contribution.  Finally, any errors that might still appear in this text are the fault, and sole responsibility, of the authors.  "

  "body": " Epigraphs    Thus, a schism appeared between the theory and the practice of the calculus as the level of rigour in the calculus was raised: the foundationalists had one set of rules, the practitioners another. The situation has persisted to this day, with quite the unfortunate and unnecessary confusions for students. It is common experience for them to learn in calculus lectures that infinitesimally small differentials do not exist, but to use them constantly in the mathematical physics lectures. While Eulerian calculus is not rigorous, it should be taught for what it is: a powerful tool for the analysis of physical and geometric phenomena, which has left its considerable mark on the conceptions, terminology, and notations of later presentations of the subject. As things are, the treatment in textbooks is unsatisfactory. Some basically follow Cauchy's practice of notating the derivative by and defining the differential by some equivalent of this, while others notate the derivative by the single symbol and omit differentials altogether; and neither treatment warns the reader of the existence of the other. Further, both treatments give a prime place to limits without explaining why the standard of rigour and generality obtainable from this very difficult concept is desirable in the first place, or what kinds of less rigorous approaches are being superseded.    Ivor Grattan-Guinness, (1941-2014)       This modern limit-theory cannot be recommended to beginners of the calculus. The physical notion of 'velocity' and the 'slope of a curve' must be retained as great aids to the young student.    Florian Cajori, (1859-1930)       To think that there is one calculus for the pure mathematician and another for the physicist, the engineer, the geometer, or the cultured layman, is to fail to appreciate that that which is most central in the calculus is its quantitative character, through which it measures and estimates the things of the world of our senses. And instruction in the calculus that does not point out -- not merely at the beginning or at the end, but all through the course -- this close contact with nature, has not done its duty by the student.

  "title": "To the Instructor: Read This First",
  "body": " To the Instructor: Read This First   Teaching is to give a systematic opportunity to the learner to discover.   George Polya (1887-1985)     Teaching Calculus, a Personal Perspective  For many years we (the authors) taught Differential Calculus in what has become in the last century or so, the traditional format. Limit definitions and theorems came first (presented formally when we were young; less so as we gained experience). From there we built up the necessary logical structure piece by piece until we had, after much effort, constructed the tools our students would need to solve the traditional problems of Calculus. It usually took a significant fraction of the semester to reach this point and we often found that for many of our students any bright eyed enthusiasm they might have brought to the course had been washed away in a cascade of unmotivated definitions (limits and continuity, for example), apparently obvious statements made unnecessarily obscure (the limit of a constant is the constant), and rote computations utterly divorced from anything in the real world. We expect that you have encountered similar difficulties.  Even a cursory look at history shows us that new mathematics is almost never created by building it up logically from first principles in this fashion. New mathematics is created to solve a particular problem. It may or may not be a real-world problem, but always some specific problem is the focal point of our efforts. If new methods are needed then we invent, we try, we discard, invent again, try again, and discard again, ad nauseum until a viable approach is finally uncovered. Then, and only then, is a rigorous, logical foundation sought.  Think for a moment about how you do your research. First you identify a problem. Are the foundational issues at the front of your mind? Probably not. At first you re just curious. You kick ideas around, trying to find some workable approach. In short, you play with the problem. You have fun with it as a means to understanding it. When you solve your problem you probably believe your result long before you prove it. Foundational issues, proofs, come later when you need to show that your results are valid. This is usually less fun.  Creating new mathematics and learning new mathematics are very similar activities. Think about how you learn new mathematics. When reading a journal article do you plod from definition, to lemma, to proof, to theorem, to proof, entirely absorbing each before moving on to the next? Probably not. Most likely you read ahead to get an overall sense of the result. Then you backtrack, skip forward, play with the ideas, generate your own examples and counterexamples. When your example is inconsistent with a theorem in the article you examine it closely in order to resolve the discrepancy and better understand the ideas in the article. In short, you begin by playing with the ideas and having fun with them.  Mathematicians rarely focus on rigor when we start to learn new mathematics ourselves because experience has taught us that rigor usually proceeds from a deep intuitive understanding. And as a result of training. It does not come easily, but with effort rigor emerges. If we force our students to plow through formal definitions, theorems, lemmas, and proofs before showing them the intuitive beauty and usefulness of our topic, before they can see the need for formal definitions, theorems, lemmas, and proofs, then we are demanding of them what we rarely ask of ourselves. The first job of the teacher is to foster enthusiasm in the student, to pique their curiosity and to show them, in Descartes phrase, the pleasure of discovery. For those who need it there is time later for the hard work of rigor.       In the first part of this text ( From Practice . . . ) our audience is the usual mix of students in a typical first semester, college level, Calculus class. All of the students, not just the budding mathematicians, and certainly not the instructor. (Presumably we have nothing to teach the instructor, although we flatter ourselves that we might, occasionally, do so anyway.) We begin in part one as Leibniz did, with the highly intuitive if questionable notion of the differential. We do not hide the problems inherent in this approach. We simply don t dwell on them. We point out the logical problems that accompany the use of differentials whenever we can without breaking up the flow of the text. We do this because it is important for students, all students, to be aware of these issues. But we defer their resolution until part two ( . . . to Theory ) when, hopefully, they will have gained an appreciation of the need for rigor.  In part two ( To Theory . . . ) our purpose is to put a solid, rigorous foundation under the differentiation techniques derived in part one. Thus our style and approach changes. We become more formal, more mathematical. We define and prove limit theorems and use these to derive the differentiation rules. But in contrast with the traditional approach we are not deriving the differentiation techniques in order to use them. In part two the point is to formally, rigorously justify rules with which the student should already be quite conversant.  In part one we address the question, How can we use Calculus to explore, and explain, our world? In part two the question is Why does Calculus work?   In this we follow our history. Calculus existed as an intuitive set of computational tools for approximately years before the limit theory made it rigorous. Surely there is no harm in allowing our students to view it the same way for a few weeks.  Moreover proceeding in this way allows us to present the need for rigor itself as a problem to be solved, rather than an abstract theory untethered from reality. For example we do not pretend that the proof of the statement, If and both exist then also exists and is equal to the obvious sum, is useful for anything other than establishing with full rigor what we already believe, intuitively, to be true. We make no such pretense because the history of our topic shows that this is in fact the truth. Limits were not invented to create Calculus, they were invented to justify it after the fact, to make it rigorous.    What Do Students Need From Calculus?  A mechanical engineer who designs cars for a living must necessarily have a deep understanding of the inner workings of the propulsion, braking, cooling, and other systems built into every automobile.  A race car driver will understand some, but not necessarily all, of the mechanical principles underlying those systems. But the racer will have a much more comprehensive, and deeply intuitive, understanding of the physics of motion that keep the car on the road under the extreme conditions of a race.  A mathematician who merely drives to and from their workplace while daydreaming about mathematics needs to understand no more about the car than how to make it move, stop, and change direction. We may understand more than that, and many of us do, but this is all we need.  But all of these people start at the same point: They learn how to drive the car.  Much the same can be said of any tool. Some need to understand it thoroughly at every level. Some need a deep intuitive grasp of its extreme capabilities. And some need only know enough to keep from hurting themselves with it. But all begin by learning how to use the tool properly.  Calculus is a tool. It was invented to solve real world problems in science and engineering. The racers in our metaphor are scientists, engineers, and businessfolk. They need, and many frequently have, a deep intuitive feel for the kinds of problems Calculus can be used to solve, and their intuitive understanding enables them to adapt Calculus techniques to novel problems. But their understanding is necessarily qualitatively different from that of a mathematician.  As mathematicians we have (indeed we must have) a deep understanding of what Calculus is, what it does, and what it can not do. We see and understand the purpose of every nuance in phrasing, the role of every lemma and theorem, every small change in notation. We understand the immense need to state our assumptions, to formulate careful, precise definitions and to rigorously prove our theorems.   Comment  The ordinary drivers in our metaphor are those, sadly rare, students in the liberal arts who take Calculus out of simple curiosity.   Because most college level Calculus courses contain students with a wide variety of interests and goals a Calculus textbook must meet the needs of students with a wide variety of interests and goals. This seems like it must be nearly impossible until we think about it for a bit. Just as we can begin the education of engineers, racers, and ordinary drivers at the same point the location and use of the controls of a car we can begin the education of engineers, scientists, and mathematicians at the same point with the computational techniques from Calculus that are most useful and universal, with examples displaying how these techniques can be used to solve technical problems, and with problems and drills designed to develop skill with them. This is what we ve tried to do in this textbook.  After learning to drive racers will go on to become more skillful at using the car, and there is no point in bludgeoning them with the details of say, the compressibility characteristics of steering fluid. Certainly they must be familiar with the need for steering fluid, and they should have a passing familiarity with the role of steering fluid in the overall steering system. In short, they need to know that the tools they are using have been carefully designed and that they work. But no more than that is necessary until and unless they need to help design a new steering system for their car.  In the same way science, engineering and business students need to be aware of the need for rigor, even if it never impinges on their daily lives. They should be familiar with the need for limits as a means of providing rigor and they should have a passing familiarity with the role of epsilons and deltas. In short, they need to know that the tools they are using have been carefully designed and that they work. But no more than that is necessary until and unless there is some specific need.  On the other hand mathematics students do need a nuanced understanding of both the practice and theory of Calculus if they are to successfully continue their studies. In addition to the ability to use Calculus, they need to understand limits and they need to understand the role of epsilons and deltas  Calculus was invented as a problem solving tool, and in our opinion, this is how it is most easily and intuitively understood by the beginning student. So part one of this text is aimed at all of the students in a typical first year college class. As a result our approach is intuitive and problem oriented.  While the audience for part two is still all of the students in the class, it is aimed, primarily, at the budding mathematicians. You will see that in part two our language and presentation become more formal, more mathematical. This is deliberate. A young mathematician needs to be exposed to the formalisms of our discipline and this is an appropriate place to begin.  But this does not mean that part two should be reserved only for honors classes full of mathematics majors. The budding engineer, scientist, or financial analyst will most likely never need to use epsilons and deltas, or even limits, in their daily work. Like the racer who should understand the need for steering fluid, but does not need a detailed understanding of its essential characteristics, these students should understand the need for rigor, even if they do not understand it in the same detail that a mathematician must. Many of these students will probably view this as an unnecessary burden, and will complain about it. But an education should provide students with what they need, not what they enjoy.  And sometimes, every now and then, some of them will find, much to their surprise, that the beauty and intricacy of a rigorous, well formed argument is as captivating to them as it is to us. We should provide our students with the opportunity to be captivated.    Some (Possibly Startling) Choices We ve Made  You will very likely find some of the choices we ve made quite startling. We describe some of them here and explain our rationale.     Leibniz Differentials  We use Leibniz differentials almost exclusively throughout part one of the text. We state the differentiation rules in their differential form (as apposed to their derivative form), and we think of the expression as the ratio of the differentials and , just as Leibniz did. We do this for several reasons.  Of all the various notations for the derivative we believe that the differential ratio to be the most intuitively expressive for the beginner. For Leibniz, the Bernoullis, Euler, and and their peers was a fraction. They thought of it as a fraction and they worked with it as a fraction. And this worked for them. They got correct results thinking this way, and the results they obtained have come down to us with the name Calculus. There is no reason not to teach our students to use this highly intuitive (albeit questionable) approach to computations.  Indeed, most teachers already do this. If you doubt the truth of the previous statement give a moment s thought to how you teach students to do integration by substitution, integration by parts, or line and path integrals.  We believe that the best pedagogy is one which meets the students where they are. In our experience students at this level have only the most tenuous grasp of the function concept but they understand slopes, as fractions, very well. So they will naturally interpret the symbol as a slope, just as Leibniz did. Admittedly this is not a mathematically mature understanding, but mathematical maturity is a goal of the first course in Calculus, not its starting point.  Calling the derivative a derived function is not as helpful to beginning students as it would be to a mature mathematician. In our experience students will generally see and as the same thing, even if they are explicitly told that is a variable and is a constant. Function notation is not the cause of this misinterpretation, but it doesn t prevent it either. If you ask a student at this level If , is an alarming number will say yes.  The formula (some expression in ) appears frequently and we will refer to it variously as a graph, an equation, or a function. We realize how annoying this lack of precision will be to you, a mature mathematician. But remember that this text is not written for you. Except in the section you are reading now we speak directly to the student, not to you. In our experience most students have only the most tenuous grasp of the distinctions between an equation, its graph, and the underlying function (or functions). For that simple reason we don t distinguish between them either, at first.  You will, no doubt, argue that these distinctions need to be taught. And you are right of course. But taught by whom?  We do not believe that deep abstractions, the notion of a function for example, are best explained in a written textbook. Teaching an abstract concept requires many examples, drawings, verbal explanations and even, occasionally, vigorous hand waving.  In short, we believe this is the purview of the instructor who is physically in the classroom with the student you. If it helps to give the students an impassioned, wild-eyed rant about these lazy, or incompetent authors who aren t using mathematical terminology correctly then by all means do that. We won t mind. We think of ourselves as your partners, or co-teachers. In that role we ve tried to we create teachable moments for you to exploit. This is one such.  But, as a mature mathematician, you will surely find this very grating. Please know that our decision is not an oversight, and certainly not laziness. It is a deliberate pedagogical choice. When you find yourself being irritated by our choices we suggest you look for ways to use them effectively.    Rigor, and the (Apparent) Lack Thereof  There are places where we will seem to be playing very fast and loose with definitions and concepts, and this choice will also grate on the sensibilities of a mature mathematician. This will be more pronounced in the beginning, but it will occur throughout. As we observed before, this is the nature of doing mathematics. Definitions and concepts emerge from our attempts to solve specific problems and there is nothing wrong with letting the student see this process in action.  But some students will surely find this apparent lack of precision upsetting. That can be be counterproductive if it is ignored. We ve tried to anticipate this as much as possible by explicitly pointing out for example, that we are computing slopes of tangent lines before actually defining a tangent line and assuring them that a definition is coming (see Section ). Essentially we ask the student to be patient. We will eventually circle back with the rigorous definitions necessary to clarify concept.  But we cannot anticipate all possible questions. When a student displays this sort of frustration you may well have a fledgling mathematician on your hands. Point them to a place (either in this text or elsewhere) where their question is answered. Or answer it yourself.  Then invite them to major in mathematics. Tell them that in the mathematical community their detail-oriented predisposition for precision will make them welcome, not weird.    Fluxions, Fluents, and Newton s Dot Notation  When we have taught Calculus in the traditional format we have found that students come away believing that slope derivative with distressing regularity. In order to stress that this is not always the right way to understand the symbol we sometimes use the dot notation when the derivative represents a velocity; a change of position with respect to time. We are also careful to point out that if then is properly interpreted as the rate of change of with respect to and that it is only when and represent coordinates in the plane that this should be understood as a slope.  For Newton the only independent variable was time, and his dot notation reflects that assumption. If represents a flowing quantity (Newton s phrase) then indicates the velocity with which it flows. For Leibniz (and most of us) this is represented by . Although the dot notation has fallen out of favor in mathematics, it is still widely used in the sciences and engineering. We believe it is a disservice to students in those majors to pretend that Newton s dot notation does not exist in the modern world. Worse, since many of our students take introductory physics (where they see dotted derivatives daily) and Calculus at the same time we only make ourselves look insular and dogmatic by pretending that the dot notation doesn t exist.  Not only do we use Newton s notation, but in Section we also use his language. When time is the variable we call the fluxion of , just as Newton did.  We did not originally intend to go this far because fluxion (and its counterpart fluent ) are very decidedly archaic words. No one uses them any more. But having decided to use the dot notation we soon realized that we could also use Newton s language to emphasize that the derivative should not always be interpreted as a slope. And no one is harmed by learning more words.    Polar Coordinates and Parametric Equations  Traditionally parametric equations and polar coordinates have been taught in the second Calculus course. But we ve brought them, lightly, into the first course.  We have done this for a couple of reasons. First, we believe it is pedagogically advantageous to introduce new concepts, and the associated notation, in the simplest possible context first. Thus, in this text we go no further than to observe that if represents time then the parametric function can be thought of as representing the motion of a point in the plane.  A second impetus was our desire to address the derivative slope problem we mentioned above. When working with the formula in polar coordinates it is not at all helpful to think of the function as the slope of anything. A broader understanding of the symbolism is necessary.  Similarly if and coordinates are given by the parametric function above then is still the slope but and are velocities (or fluxions in Newton s phrase).    Problems in Context  You will notice that the problems do not appear all-in-a-lump at the ends of sections. They are embedded in the text at the point where we discuss the methods needed to solve them. This seems to us a much better practice than lumping them all together in Problem Sections and forcing students to search backward through each section for the appropriate discussion.  We find that it also encourages the students to actually read the text, since they know that the exposition near to their problem will be relevant to the problem. We suggest that you explicitly point out this aspect of our text to your students, since by the time they get to college many students have concluded that the only relevant parts of the textbook are the problems and the examples and they habitually skip everything else.    There is No Solution Manual  We have not written a solution manual for this text. Nor do we intend to. There are several reasons for this.  First, in an age when every college student can open a web browser and type in, for example, Differentiate and instantly get back not only the correct derivative, but also a step-by-step guide for how to do the computation, the point of spending any part of our lives providing the solution to such drill problems is completely lost on us. We have better things to do.  Second, many Calculus problems can be checked by an appropriately drawn graph. For example, if the problem is to find an equation of the line tangent to the graph of at the student need only graph the function and their solution to see if they have found the correct line. Until now it would have been unreasonable to ask students to check their work by graphing but modern students have access to a dizzying array of graphing tools at the click of a mouse. And this will most likely always be true. In our opinion they should be encouraged to use the resources available to them.  Third, as much as possible we have written the problems in such a way that the results of any computations needed are part of the problem statement. For example, one problem asks the student to show that if then . Notice that the value of the second derivative is given in the problem. As much as possible we want to keep the students focused on understanding the problem, rather than rote computations.       Some Practical Advice     Precalculus vs. Pre-Calculus   Chapter is about both precalculus (meaning that it uses only the tools students learn before taking Calculus) and pre-Calculus (meaning that it is about the mathematical tools that were the historical precursors of Calculus).  It is about precalculus because in this chapter we attempt to solve a number of Calculus-like problems using precalculus techniques (and clever tricks). As such, this chapter fulfills the customary purpose of the introductory chapter of a Calculus text. It reinforces the idea that the students already have many very powerful tools in hand that are supplemented, not replaced, by Calculus. And it gives them a quick reminder of how to use some of these.         Chapter is about pre-Calculus because we use it to set the stage for the new method (Leibniz phrase) of Differential Calculus. It is, after all, difficult to understand the point of a new method if the methods being replaced are unknown. In Chapter we examine a few of the very clever tools invented by Fermat, Descartes, and Roberval which anticipated the Calculus of Newton and Leibniz. These ideas were very influential and helped shape the form that modern Calculus has taken, and they can be understood, with effort, by anyone reasonably skillful with the tools of precalculus.  When we (the authors) have taught in the traditional format we ve tended to skip the introductory, or review chapter that appears in every Calculus text. Or, at least, we ve given it very short shrift. We ve done this because for the student it is frequently little more than a short recitation of previously studied algebraic, geometric, and trigonometric formulas. As faculty we of course see and understand the need for facility with these formulas in the upcoming material. But the student does not. From the point of view of the student this is simply a dull rehashing of known material. We serve neither our students nor ourselves if we start the semester out by boring them.  However we advise you very strongly to not give Chapter short shrift. We have not simply rehashed a set of algebraic and trigonometric facts. Instead we use some basic Algebra and Geometry to study and discuss a few of the optimization and slope finding techniques that were precursors of Calculus. These techniques Particularly Fermat s Method of Adequality  are very Calculus-like so they foreshadow the ideas to come. And the student has most likely never seen them before. Thus they are inherently interesting (or at least not mind-numbingly dull). It is useful to examine them, to see how they work and where they fall short, before diving into Calculus itself. Also later in the text, we return to some of the problems and examples from Chapter in order to compare and contrast the Calculus and pre-Calculus methods.     But be warned: The techniques developed by the pre-Calculus pioneers are very clever. They are so genuinely appealing that it is easy to get caught up in them and spend too much time on them. We speak from experience. Be careful.    Inquiry Based Learning (IBL)  We did not specifically design this to be an IBL text. However we are strong proponents of the idea that interesting and illuminative problems should drive any math course. We therefore believe that this text will work well in an IBL, as well as a more traditional environment.                      The problems in this book are paramount. We tried very hard to let the problems drive the presentation, and we recommend that you do the same. If you don t like our problems use your own. We won t mind. In fact, if you have better problems please share them with us (see A Plea For Help below).       The TRIUMPHS Project   Comment   TR ansfoming I nstruction in U ndergraduate M athematics I nstruction via P rimary H istorical S ources   The TRIUMPHS project consists of a collection of over Primary Source Projects (PSPs) on a wide range of topics from courses across the undergraduate mathematics curriculum and all are freely available for download at the TRIUMPHS website     We quote from the project website:   The TRIUMPHS project creates materials for use in the undergraduate mathematics classroom which teaches content based around original mathematical sources such as the writings of Poincarè, Euclid, Lobachevsky, Hausdorff, and many others. These materials are freely available and downloadable for use in the clasroom. The goal of the project is to write, develop, disseminate, and test these curricular materials.   The TRIUMPHS project was ongoing at the same time we were writing this textbook. Since both projects proceed from the premise that history is a useful organizing strategy for teaching mathematics, and both are published under a Creative Commons license it seemed to us that our text can be enhanced by  those TRIUMPHS PSPs which were relevant to Calculus.  At those points in the text which correspond to particular PSP a reference (and link) is provided.     We are grateful for the work of the specific TRIUMPHS authors we have included in this text, but we are also grateful for the TRIUMPHS project in general. There are TRIUMPHS PSPs for many, many more topics than we are able to include here and we highly recommend that you take a look at them and consider incorporating any appropriate PSPs into every course you teach.      Rantings From the Cranky Old Guys in the Back of the Room  We (the authors of this text) have watched the following scene play out over and over again at professional meetings. The actors change but the script is surprisingly stable.  A speaker is introduced, rises, and talks briefly about a problem they have encountered while teaching Calculus . . . or Basic Algebra . . . or Trigonometry . . . or whatever. At some point the talk is shanghaied by a Cranky Old Guy (it is usually a guy) in the back of the room. He has identified the solution to The Problem with teaching Calculus . . . or Basic Algebra . . . or Trigonometry . . . or whatever, and in order to fix The Problem all we have to do is follow his recipe. The audience is then treated to a sincere, vehement, wild-eyed, and often spittle-spewn description of his recipe that clearly emanates from the fervor of divine inspiration.  We do not criticize the Cranky Old Guy . We recognize that when you believe you have found a lighted path in a darkening forest it is hard to contain your excitement. Also we fear we may have more in common with him than we are entirely comfortable with.  This text grew from our conviction that an historical approach to Calculus, particularly the use of the highly intuitive notion of the differential, which was used to excellent effect by the likes of Leibniz, the Bernoullis, L Hopital, and the master, Euler, to name just a few, provides a viable, interesting, and useful framework for teaching Calculus.  As we complete our text we are more convinced than ever that this is true.   Comment  Well, OK, sure. We actually do believe this is the best way. Without that conviction we d never have finished. But we haven t completely lost touch with reality. As far-fetched as it seems to us, we recognize the possibility that we might be wrong.   But if we re being honest we must admit the possibility that we re wrong. We don t believe we ve found the only way to teach Calculus, or even the best, or that everyone should teach this way. What we do have is a way to teach Calculus that is very different from what has been done for the past century or so. You will have to decide whether or not it works for you.  It is also possible that in our conviction we may be edging into Cranky Old Guy territory. But we will leave that judgment to you. We don t really want to know.    A Plea For Help  This text is not finished. No textbook ever is. Eventually the authors simply stop writing.  But always there a very illuminating problem, a nice turn of phrase, a revealing metaphor, or a tangential subject which wasn t known at the time of writing that should have been included. And typos. Always, there are typos.  A nice feature of publishing an online Open Educational Resource (OER) text like this one is that it can be revised more-or-less continuously as needed.   Comment  Obviously some care must be taken. We would not, for example, want to insert a new problem thereby changing the numbers of all subsequent problems during a semester while the text is being used. But spelling errors and typos can be addressed at any time.   Even better, we are not limited to only using the work of the original authors. If you have a favorite problem that you use in your classroom and that you d be willing to share please share it with us. If yours works better than a problem we already have, we ll happily swap it in. If yours simply fills a need that we ve left unaddressed we ll be happy to include your problem. Naturally, we will give you credit for your work if you want.

  "title": "Calculus is a Rock",
  "body": " Calculus is a Rock    A medieval European counting board.      Commercial transactions were hard to do using Roman numerals. So in Europe during the Middle Ages such computations were usually done using pebbles on a small table called a counting board. The board was marked off so that placing a pebble here we meant one, there meant ten, over there meant a hundred, and so on. Think of an abacus. Obviously the only computational skills a merchant needed were a thorough knowledge of rules for moving the pebbles and how to read the board afterward.  The Latin word for rock or pebble is calculus. Thus the English word calculus has come to refer to any computational scheme where it was not really necessary to understand the computations in order to apply them, at least for basic applications.    A traditional Chinese suanpan (abacus).    An abacus    Nevertheless it is a calculus in the original sense. That is, it is possible to simply memorize the rules for manipulating symbols ( move the pebbles ) and thereby solve a great many otherwise very difficult problems without any very deep understanding. There is nothing wrong with using Calculus this way. Indeed, this is precisely what it was invented to do. The difficulty is that those who learn only to manipulate symbols are in a position similar to the merchants of the Middle Ages. They can do the calculations but they only understand how to move the pebbles (use the notation). If a problem comes up that is outside the reach of their pebbles they are completely helpless.  This was not a problem for say, Marco Polo. He rarely had to do much mathematics besides add, subtract, multiply and divide. A deep understanding of these operations is not needed for the simple financial transactions of the Middle Ages. However, in the modern era such routine, rudimentary computations are done by machines. The role of humans is to figure out how to apply the fundamental concepts in novel arenas and in novel ways. Simply learning to compute, without a deeper understanding of the principles involved, is not a foundation upon which a modern education can be built. Modern practioners must be flexible, and flexibility comes from a deep understanding of principles.  As you will soon see many otherwise very difficult problems become straightforward, even simple if we know how to manipulate Calculus notation (move the pebbles) correctly. So simple in fact, that it is easy to confuse the manipulation of notation with understanding. Don t make that mistake.  Notation is not mathematics. Notation is simply the best way we ve found for representing mathematical ideas and communicating them to other people. Notice that we did not say that it is the best way. Only that it is the best we ve found so far. Sometimes our notation falls short of our needs; sometimes far short. When it does only a deep understanding of fundamental concepts will clarify the problem for you.  Even though the rules for manipulating the notation of Calculus were designed to be used blindly, this does not make them unimportant. If anything it is more important in the modern era than it has ever been that students learn to read the notation with understanding and to use the computational rules skillfully because it is through mastering these fundamentals that the underlying concepts emerge and become clear.  So we will begin with the Calculus notation, and the rules for its manipulation. But we (your teacher, and the authors of this book) cannot master this for you. We are only your guides. You must stay focused on understanding not mere computation. The process is slow. It takes time and practice and it can be very frustrating. Prepare yourself. Arrange your study schedule to give yourself as much time for practice as you can possibly manage. Do not accept simply getting the right answer as good enough. If you can correctly perform some computation but don t take the time to understand why that particular manipulation of the symbols led you to the right answer then you are wasting your time. Your goal is to understand, not to compute.  It may surprise you to learn that when it was first invented the validity of the Calculus was very suspect. The underlying ideas were very ad hoc and did not stand up to close scrutiny at all. Indeed, the foundations of the topic were so murky that the only reason Calculus remained viable was the simple fact that it worked. Or at least, it seemed to. This was taken as evidence that the underlying principles were valid but no one was very comfortable with the fact that those principles could not be unambiguously stated. It took about years to finally work out a supporting logical foundation that explained why the symbol manipulations of Calculus worked and, perhaps more importantly, when they wouldn t work.  This text follows the history of our topic. In the first part ( From Practice . . . ) we begin with the rules for performing Calculus computations we ll learn to move the pebbles. When these have been mastered we ll learn to use these computational methods to solve some (hopefully) interesting and (definitely) substantial problems.  We will not address the logical underpinnings of the Calculus until the second part ( . . . To Theory ) where we will examine the logical support structure that took some the greatest minds our species has known almost years to develop. Naturally this will require a shift in our focus. In the first part of this text you will learn how to use Calculus. In the second part you will learn why it works the way that it does.  This will be hard. At times it will be very hard. But it is worth the effort. At the other end, when it all comes together, there is a transcendent beauty to the Calculus which is impossible to convey to the uninitiated. A poet once wrote, Euclid alone has looked on beauty bare, but this is not true. Everyone who has studied and understood mathematics beyond the level of moving the pebbles has seen the same beauty that Euclid saw. If you have never seen it this is your chance.  "

  "title": "Introduction: Some  Advice on Problem Solving",
  "body": " Introduction: Some Advice on Problem Solving    The most difficult thing is the decision to act, the rest is merely tenacity.   Amelia Earhart (1897-1937     You just keep pushing. You just keep pushing. I made every mistake that could be made. But I just kept pushing.   Renè Descartes} ( )    Our purpose here is to give you our very best advice on how to succeed in this course and a realistic impression of the level of difficulty of the course material. Please read this carefully and take our advice. We know what we are talking about. Believe us.  Because the topic we will be studying is called Calculus there is a strong tendency to assume that only the concepts and techniques of Calculus are needed to solve the problems you will encounter in this course. That is not true. You will need all of the mathematics you know. And probably more. Really.    Using Letters Instead of Numbers  Before we begin, a few comments on notation are apropos.  Suppose your teacher starts a lecture with the statement, Suppose and are two positive numbers. Then and . A common complaint is that we re making the problem harder. This is often accompanied with a request to replace and with numbers, just to make it easier to understand. For example, if and are numbers why not just say that is and is ? In that case it is clear that and . Why do we have to make it more complicated?  Suppose your teacher starts a lecture with the statement, Suppose and are two positive numbers. Then and . A common complaint is that we re making the problem harder. This is often accompanied with a request to replace and with numbers, just to make it easier to understand. For example, if and are numbers why not just say that is and is ? In that case it is clear that and . Why do we have to make it more complicated?  This seems like a reasonable point until you think about it a bit more. Suppose we use the numbers and instead? Is it obvious to you that or   Our point here is that the symbol is no different than the symbol . Or the symbol . These are all valid symbols representing numbers. So we treat them all the same. For example, all of the following are valid statements: The difference is this: If and the first statement includes the second as a specific case. Similarly if and the first statement includes the third. The first statement is more general. It is true no matter what and are.    Problem    Use the fact that to show that . Do not use a calculator.   Check the validity of the following statements. Are they true?      Using a calculator on would be rather pointless. Try it and see.   Show that it is not always true that if and are numbers then    Find a restriction on the possible values of and that will guarantee that inequality ) is true.   Keeping things simple is laudable as a goal and we don t want to suggest that you shouldn t do it. It can be very useful to look at a special case of a general statement just to get a sense of the problem. For example, a good way to trick yourself into abstraction is to think and , but write down and . As long as you don’t try to do anything that relies on the particular properties of and , you should be fine. But you wouldn’t want to say something like is an even integer (even though is). The sum is an even integer because both and are odd integers, but this is special to these numbers and won t be true for and in general.    Suppose and are both integers. Find restrictions on the possible values of and that will guarantee that is an even, positive integer.    Now suppose and are both numbers. Find restrictions on the possible values of and that will guarantee that is an even, positive integer. (This is not the same problem as part (a). Read it carefully.)    When looking at most people are inclined to compute this to get . If the problem is: Find the value of , then sure, doing the arithmetic is the correct thing to do. But the last time you were asked to do multiplication for its own sake you were probably years old. Elementary computations like this will only come up in the context of a more advanced problem. Before doing this calculation, you should ask yourself if it will help you solve the more advanced problem.  Now suppose the problem is: Determine if the number is divisible by . Do you see that computing will only make the problem harder?  Your college professors will never ask you to do an arithmetic calculation for its own sake. Instead arithmetic problems will come up in the context of a more advanced problem and you will need to use your arithmetic skill to uncover patterns. But doing the arithmetic, boiling everything down to a single number usually hides the patterns!  For example, is it easier to see the pattern in the following list of numbers when they are presented like this: or like this: .    Problem Actually, there is something rather liberating about using letters to represent a broad class of numbers. Consider the following questions:   Is the number a perfect square? If so, what is its square root?   What about ? Was your calculator of any use on this? Notice that these numbers were completely factored into their prime factorizations. Did that help? How?   Now suppose that is a positive integer. Is always a perfect square? If not, for which values of will it be a perfect square?   What can you say, in general, about whether or not an integer greater than one is a perfect square in terms of its prime factorization?     Substitution, or Making Things Easy on the Eyes   Mathematicians do not study objects, but relations between objects. Thus, they are free to replace some objects by others so long as the relations remain unchanged.   Henri Poincarè (1854-1912)    It is a common misconception is mathematicians love complicated formulas. In fact, the opposite is true. We really very much prefer to keep things as simple as possible. We only accept complexity when we are forced to. Moreover, with experience we have learned that complexity is usually borne of an inadequate understanding of the problem. Better understanding usually results in a simpler formulation.  This works in reverse too. If we can find a simple way to express what appears to be a complex problem we can usually gain a deeper understanding of the problem and its solution. A judicious substitution is one way to re-express a complex problem.   A Horrible Formula  For example, suppose you were asked to solve the following equation for : At first glance this looks horribly complicated. But look at it again. On the right the coefficient of is That s just a number. It is approximately but who cares? For purposes of algebraically isolating all we need to know is that it is a number. Rather than calling it , let s just call it something simple, like . Think of it as giving the expression a nickname; something shorter, and easier to remember.  If we make that substitution our equation is now which is a bit easier on the eyes.   But wait. The expression is also just a number. Let s make it easier on the eyes, too. If we let we have which is even easier to look at. By now you see where this is going. If we let then our equation is which is much easier on the eyes than the original equation was. In fact, we can now see that this is really a very simple equation and the solution is . Of course we inserted , , and into the problem so now we need to unwind our substitutions. When we do that we get If a decimal number is required we could enter this formula into whatever computational tool we re using. Good luck with that.   The previous example was clearly contrived. Obviously we went out of our way to make a simple problem look complicated just so we could simplify it. As a result it would be easy to dismiss this as a silly example. But it is not. There is a serious lesson to be learned here. One that we will use over and over again in the near future. By its very nature mathematical notation is not easy to read. It is so dense, with so much information packed into a few symbols, that it is easy to misinterpret. Making a formula easier to read can be very helpful. A well chosen substitution can make a complex looking formula much easier to work with.   When you were learning Algebra you almost certainly encountered problems like this: Given solve for .  At first glance, this looks like a formidable problem. However, if we look closer we see that it actually has a very familiar form. Because we can rewrite Equation as and if you look closely you ll see that Equation~ ) is quadratic in form. That is, it is really a quadratic equation which we know how to solve in disguise. However it is still rather difficult to see the quadratic nature of Equation . To make this very clear we let That is, just as in Example we give the expression the nickname, , which is shorter, easier to remember, and easier on the eyes. Then Equation becomes the quadratic equation: Our problem is not solved. Indeed, we haven t even tried to solve it yet. But it is much more simply expressed. And because it is more simply expressed we can now see how to solve it. Factoring, we have so we have and . But, of course, these are not solutions of our problem. We have found (which we inserted into the problem) not (which is what we need to find). To complete the solution we need to unwind the substitution we made and solve the two equations yielding the solutions and , respectively.   In making a substitution our goal is always to make the formulas we are dealing with simpler to understand and easier to read. In Examples  and it was straightforward to see how to do that. There were expressions that were hard to read so we simply replaced a complicated part of the problem with something simple. It isn t always that easy. Sometimes just finding a good substitution presents challenges of its own.  Straightforward is not the same as easy.   For example, the Quadratic Formula can be derived by making a very simple substitution that allows us to solve the general quadratic equation Once the substitution is found it is very easy to work through the algebra, but finding the right substitution in the first place is not straightforward at all.    Problem Before reading any further see if you can come up with the right substitution for Equation ).   The goal is to eliminate the linear term, . You can see how this would help. If were not present in Equation we could easily solve    Were you able to solve Problem ? It s actually very hard to do without some guidance. Here s another hint. Try the substitution where is a parameter to be determined. That is, make this substitution and find the value of that eliminates the linear term.  After making this substitution the problem will be given in terms of , not . That s OK. Solve the problem in this form, and then unwind your substitution back to the original variable.    Problem Notice that after making our substitution we get: which is more complicated, not less. Of course it is. Sometimes you have to complicate before you can simplify. Don t give up. Multiply everything out to see what you ve got.  Once you ve found make the substitution and eliminate the linear term that was the objective, remember? At that point you should see the Quadratic Formula starting to emerge. Don t forget to unwind the substitution and solve for .     An Easy Problem From Geometry   Ideas are like rabbits. You get a couple and learn how to handle them, and pretty soon you have a dozen.   John Steinbeck (1902-1968)    We ve chosen the following example because it is neither particularly easy nor particularly difficult. It is typical of the kinds of medium level problems that appear in most Calculus textbooks.    The lengths of two sides of a triangle are and . If the third side is chosen in such a way that the area of the triangle is as large as possible what is the length of the third side?  You may be able to intuit the correct answer to this problem. That s OK, but you should try to solve it, too. By solve we mean that you should be able to explain to someone with the same mathematical skills you have at the moment why your answer is correct.   No, really. Give this problem a serious shot before you go on. It is not important that you succeed. Only that you try.   Before reading further do your best to solve this problem in Example . We ll wait.  At first it is difficult to see where to begin. (That s why it s called a problem.) Don t let this stop you! In our experience the most common mistake is giving up too soon.  Don t. Do. That. Keep thinking.    Partial Solution  Since we know the lengths of the sides and of our triangle let s draw it. The sketch at the right would be typical. The question is, what length for side makes the total area enclosed by the triangle as large as it can possibly be?  Now what?  Well, this looks like a right triangle doesn t it? If it is a right triangle, then we can find the length of via the Pythagorean Theorem: right?  Before you go on take a moment and really think about this problem. Can it really be that simple? Can you find any flaws in our reasoning.  Once you think about it you see that we have no reason to believe that the triangle we seek must be a right triangle. It was completely accidental that we drew our diagram that way. If this seems like a simple-minded mistake, the sort of mistake that you would never make, be careful. It is a mistake to rely too heavily on the diagrams we draw. But it is an easy mistake to make, especially when the problems are more complicated, because as problems get complex we will need to rely on visualization more and more. This was not a dumb mistake. It was just a bit careless, and it is easy to be careless, especially when we first start thinking about a problem.     DIGRESSION: Making Mistakes  Digression Making Mistakes   Being wrong isn t a bad thing like they teach you in school. It is an opportunity to learn something.   Richard Feynman (1918-1988)     Note to self  This needs do be done differently.    Experience is the name everyone gives to their mistakes.   Oscar Wilde (1854-1900)    By definition, mistakes are wrong. A mistake is always obvious after you recognize it as a mistake. Everyone makes mistakes in the course of solving a problem. The process of making mistakes, recognizing them as mistakes, and figuring out why they are mistakes is called learning. The very smartest people, for example Isaac Newton , Gottfried Leibniz , Galileo , Pierre Fermat , Marie Curie , Emmy Nöther , Albert Einstein , or Richard Feynman , made lots of mistakes. Making mistakes is how they got to be smart.  Isaac Newton was once asked how he had been able to solve problems that no one before him had solved. His reply: By thinking, and thinking, and thinking about them. Of course, when he described his solutions he left out all of the errors like anyone would do, because, who cares about those? Making mistakes doesn t typically get the attention it deserves. An expert is someone who has made every possible mistake. This is why your teacher, an expert, will seldom err.  And will be embarrassed when they do.   Each mistake you make reflects the level of your current understanding of the problem. Each mistake you make takes you a little closer to expertise. Embrace your mistakes and make lots of them! They are proof that you are making progress. But make no mistake (Gasp!) about it, making and embracing a mistake is just the first step. You also have to figure out what went wrong.  Sadly, mistakes are too often seen as a source of embarrassment. Too many students will berate themselves as stupid every time they make a mistake. Don t do that. It is pointless and counter-productive. All it will do is destroy your self confidence. Don t do it. Learning Calculus can be hard, but you would not have made it this far if you couldn t do it. So keep making mistakes. Ask for help when you need it. And don t give up. You have not failed until you stop trying.   Did we mention that you shouldn t berate yourself when you make a mistake? You really shouldn t.   END OF DIGRESSION   Let s look at this problem again. The triangle we seek might look like the first one we drew, or it might look like either of the ones drawn in the diagram below, or myriad others. We simply don t have enough information to decide at this point.    But from the diagrams we ve drawn so far we can see that one end of side must be pinned to one end of side and for each angle between and we have a different possible triangle. We don t have to think of both of them as in motion. We can think of one of them, say , as fixed while the other swings around their common endpoint. The circle in our diagram indicates all of the possible positions .  Do you see how that worked? Our first attempt was simple-minded, but by drawing our first, simple-minded sketch, making a stab at a solution, and figuring out why our simple-minded approach won t work, we were led to this insight: We can think of as static, and we can think of as swinging freely while pinned to the end of     Clearly we need to find the angle between and  - call it as in the sketch at the right - that maximizes the area of the triangle. But which angle does that?  Whenever triangles are involved it is a good idea to recall your Trigonometry. After all, that s what Trigonometry is about, isn t it? Since we are thinking of as fixed, we may as well use it as the base. This makes the height equal to Also, since we re trying to maximize the area we should probably write down the area formula: Thus the area of the triangle is   Is it clear that our initial guess was correct? The angle, that maximizes the area will be the one whose sine is as large as possible. That would be so provides the maximum area.  You might be a little uncomfortable with our argument that is maximized when . If so, then for you, this problem is not finished. Possibly we ve made a mistake. Let s follow our own advice and see why it is a mistake, if it is.    Problem Replace with in the diagram above. Use the Pythagorean Theorem to reason that if then . How does this apply to the problem of maximizing the area of the triangle?   Until we can demonstrate that with a convincing and rigorous argument, this problem is not solved. Instead it is only a conjecture; an educated guess. Our evidence so far is very convincing so it is a very well educated guess, but it is still only a guess.    Our advice, a synopsis   There are times when I feel like I m in a big forest and don t know where I m going. But then somehow I come to the top of a hill and can see everything more clearly. When that happens it s really exciting.   Maryam Mirzakhani (1977-2017)     If you see a whole thing it seems that it s always beautiful. Planets, lives . . . But up close a world s all dirt and rocks. And day to day, life s a hard job, you get tired, you lose the pattern.   Ursula K. Le Guin (1929-2018)    In order to solve a problem, any problem, you must:   Have an idea  Solving a mathematical problem is a bit like getting dropped in the woods without a map or any GPS technology and being told to find your way out. First you have to find a path. Once a path is found, you have to follow it. Nothing else really has a chance of working. Following your path will eventually lead you to another path. Now you have to decide which path to follow, so you look around and make your best guess. If you guess right, great! If not you will have to backtrack and take the other path. And so it goes. Guess. Backtrack. Guess again. As you learn the terrain and get familiar with the network of paths your guesses get better. Sometimes none of the paths you ve found seem to be getting you closer to your destination. So you have to try something different, like getting off of the path completely.  Eventually you ll get where you re going but the one thing you can t do is give up. You will never get anywhere if you don t keep trying.  Having an idea is like following a path in the woods. It s a start, but that s all it is. You still have to follow it. After you ve taken it as far as you can you need to look for another idea; a new path to follow.  Finding your way out of the woods takes patience, diligence, and a lot of hard work. So does solving a mathematics problem. Except, of course, that you won t die of exposure if you don t solve the math problem.  If an idea occurs to you, follow it. Most likely you will not hit on a good, or even a workable approach the first time. Or the first three times. That s OK. Keep thinking about the problem anyway. It is frustrating and it doesn t feel like progress, but it is. As long as you are having and discarding ideas you are making progress.    Really, have an idea. If you don t have a good idea, then use a bad one.  OK, we hear you say, but what if I don t have any good ideas? What do I do then?  Easy. Use a not-so-good idea.  This is what you ve been doing all of your life anyway isn t it? You just didn t tell anyone because you were sure you were doing something wrong, right? You weren t.  The most important thing you can do is get started. That s what having an idea is for, getting started. All we did to start the problem in Example was draw the lines and Look back up at our partial solution and see. The first thing we did was make the drawing below:   Can you think of anything more simple-minded? And yet it worked. It didn t work right away, but it got us moving in the right direction.    Have another idea.  Because this is a textbook we couldn t really waste time and pages by running down blind alleys, so we started off with an idea that we knew would take us in the right direction. In real life this usually won t happen. Most often your first (two or three or four) ideas aren t going to take you in the right direction. That s OK. Figure out what is wrong with them. You had some intuition about the problem that led you to your idea. Figuring out why it didn t work will clarify things for you just a bit. That will help.  So, have another idea that is based on what you learned from your first idea. And another. And another after that. Keep having ideas until you find one that works. Another way to say this is: Don t give up.    Ask for help when you get stuck, not before.  Sometimes ideas just won t come to you. That s OK. Sometimes you will need help. Ask for it. Ask your teacher, another student, a tutor, your Mom, your Dad, a former teacher. Ask. For. Help.  But ask constructively. If you are asking another student, a peer, it is fine to ask, How do I do this problem? But if you are asking your teacher, or a tutor, this sounds a lot like, This problem looks hard, my friends are meeting up in half an hour and, besides, I don t really want to spend any more time on it. Please, do this problem and let me watch so I can turn it in and go have fun with my friends. This is not usually effective. Moreover some teachers will get a little testy about it. Instead ask something like, I ve tried this, and this, and this, but I keep getting stuck here. Can you give me some direction? That shows that you have already put real effort into solving the problem and are willing to continue working on it.  To be clear, your teacher knows that a serious student does not mean this, that you really just want to learn how to do the problem. The difficulty is that there are always some students who have no qualms about asking their instructor to do problem after problem with no intention of learning anything. They just want to copy the answers down and quit. Teachers quickly learn to identify these students from the way they ask questions. If you approach your instructor in the same fashion that a non-serious student does the response you get won t be as helpful as you would like. Teachers want to help serious students, but non-serious students are a waste of time. Be a serious student. Just as importantly, act like a serious student.  Or, if you find the problem so mystifying that you can t even think of a first idea ask, I really don t know where to begin on this problem. Can you point me in the right direction to get me started?     Keep thinking about the problem after you solve it.  After you ve solved a problem, pause for a moment, take a sip of coffee, or tea, or whatever and think about the problem you just solved. This is like the difference between looking at a mountain from its base, when all you can see is the tangle of brush in your way, and looking at it from the peak. From the peak all of the obstacles you overcame getting there look small and unimportant. You can see the broad outlines of the mountain and the path you took climbing it. Frequently you will also see a better path than the one you took.  This kind of reflection is the most neglected aspect of problem solving. After you ve been struggling with a problem you probably don t ever want to see it again. This is a natural response. However, before you put the problem away reflect on your solution and make this part of your knowledge base. Think about which ideas you had that worked, and which ideas you had that didn t work. Think about why they did, or didn t work. Do this immediately, while the problem is still in your mind. Later, if something reminds you of this problem, think about it some more to see why you were reminded of it.  The difference between the teacher and the student is not intelligence, but experience. The more problems you solve, the more experience you gain. But you need to be able to use that experience for subsequent problems. Reflecting on a problem after you solve it is how you make the knowledge you gained from the problem available for later use.  For example, see if you can use what you learned from the triangle problem to solve .    Use your intuition, but don t trust it.  Finally, because many problems in Calculus are about motion and you are very familiar with how things move, you will often have a good deal of intuition into their solution. Paradoxically you need to learn to use, but not to trust, your intuition.  When approaching a problem intuitively, there is a tendency to add assumptions to familiar looking problems. Notice how easy it was to believe that our triangle must be a right triangle just because our first drawing looked like a right triangle.  As we said, you will have some intuition into many problems, and intuition can be very helpful, but it can also lead you astray. You need to learn to support your intuition with reasoning.

  "title": "Science Before Calculus",
  "body": " Science Before Calculus   Apologia   In any particular theory there is only as much real science as there is mathematics.   Immanuel Kant (1724-1804)     The mathematician may be compared to a designer of garments, who is utterly oblivious of the creatures whom his garments may fit. To be sure, his art originated in the necessity for clothing such creatures, but this was long ago; to this day a shape will occasionally appear which will fit into the garment as if the garment had been made for it. Then there is no end of surprise and delight.   George Dantzig (1914-2005)    Like the authors, your instructor is probably a highly trained, professional mathematician. As mathematicians we solve problems and we build logical structures. This is what we were trained to do.  The structures we build are what makes mathematics useful but that is not why we build them. Most of the time we create simply for the love of the creative act itself. Usefulness, as such, is often a secondary consideration. In this, mathematicians are more like poets or artists than scientists or engineers. By and large, we consider the act of creation to be its own reward. It is a remarkable fact that sometimes the logical structures we build turn out to be applicable to problems in the real world.   Comment  This is why mathematicians sometimes seem to be out of touch with the real world. Much like poets and artists, when we are doing mathematics we actually are out of touch, at least a little.   When we explain our mathematical works to each other we mathematicians only display the finished product in much the same way that an artist or an architect will display their work without all of the behind-the-scenes sketches and pencil lines (and mistakes), that they made along the way. We start with simple ideas and bit by bit, piece by piece, we assemble our mathematics like we would a puzzle. When we explain it to others we ignore all of the mistakes we made along the way for the same reason that artists do. They are not part the finished product. That is how we understand, and think about our mathematics, and that is how we talk to each other about it. Displayed in this manner a mathematical structure is truly as beautiful as any artistic creation.  But in this text we are not talking to other mathematicians. We are talking to you, a mathematics student. And you are (presumably) encountering Calculus for the first time. This is not the time to build Calculus up from its logical foundations and expect you to appreciate its beauty. This is the time to show you where Calculus came from, how it was built, what problems it was invented to solve, and, perhaps most importantly, how well Calculus addresses those problems. Once that is done you will appreciate it, or not, as your own sense of aesthetics allows.  As you proceed through this text know that it took several centuries for some of the most brilliant persons who have ever lived to polish the ideas of Calculus to their current luster. But just as a painting is unappealing before it is finished, Calculus is not lustrous until you can look back on it as a whole. Until then it takes a lot of calculation and thought to see how the ideas work together. In the end, we hope you will come to see that it is worth all of the work and frustration.  In this chapter we will be exploring the ad hoc techniques used by the mathematical pioneers who were trying to solve some very real and very specific problems using only the tools that you possess now: Geometry, Algebra, and Trigonometry. The pre-Calculus techniques they came up with substantially influenced the form that Calculus eventually took. If the pioneers had been different people, or if they had begun with different tools Calculus would likely have taken a different form. Or it might not have been invented at all. The pre-Calculus methods we will see in this chapter represent the first ideas that eventually led to Calculus. The supporting logical structure came later, much later.  Thus we will begin with the intuitive notions that preceded Calculus. But we will not hide the problems inherent in this approach. Quite the reverse. It is our intention to highlight them as much as possible. The underlying difficulties are real and they need to be understood. We want you to be aware of them so that in Chapter when we begin to address them, the necessity of the rather severe formalism we are forced to adopt will be clear to you.  For example, we will soon start talking about the line tangent to a curve. You have a very clear image of what is meant by tangent line and that will suffice to begin. But, it is actually very hard to define precisely what we mean by the line tangent to a curve.    Comment  You almost certainly don't believe this because nothing could be clearer than the image of tangency you have in your head. Nevertheless we will eventually see that it is true.   Later we will encounter a similar difficulty with the idea of a continuous curve. The phrase continuous curve surely conjures up a very clear image in your mind. Nothing could be clearer really. Continuous curves are unbroken curves, right? This is oso intuitively obvious that mathematicians did not bother to define it formally for millennia. Most likely you don't see the need for a formal definition either. Yet. But continuity is very hard to define in a mathematically rigorous manner. The first person to give a rigorous definition in the modern sense was Bernhard Bolzano in 1817.    Bernhard Bolzano 1781-1848    One of our goals is to set up the conditions under which it will become very clear to you why your intuitive image of a tangent line, or a continuous curve is not sufficient; why these are hard concepts to define. We want you to bump into the difficulties that come with the intuitive understanding you have right now so that you will see and appreciate why the definitions we will eventually be offering are better. Or at least more useful.  But have some sympathy for the poor instructor! Everything we do in the first part of this text, especially in this section, goes directly against all of the instructor's training as a mathematician. Instructors would be much happier with us if we would define the terms the line tangent to a curve and continuous curve before we use them because that is the way they see and appreciate the beauty of our topic.  Indeed, it may well go against your own sensibilities as well. If you find yourself getting irritated with the imprecision of our presentation you may well be a mathematician yourself, at least by temperament. In that case, all you lack is training and you can get that by changing your major to mathematics. Think about it. If you are not a mathematician at heart then this first part of the text is the part you will probably find most useful and interesting. This is where we will try to elucidate the most powerful problem solving tools that came from Calculus and show you how to use them. But the problems are only representative. Pay attention to the techniques, not to the problems themselves.  The problem is that this is not (in our opinion) a good way to learn Calculus. So we will be following in the footsteps of our forebears. We will proceed using intuitive ideas until they become too unwieldy to use. Only after we have found the properties we need from a concept (like tangent ) will we offer formal definitions. Hopefully it will then be clear to you why the definitions are needed, and why they are stated as they are.    Niccolo Fontana (The Stutterer) 1500-1557    So to the instructor, or anyone else of a mathematical bent who might be reading this, we offer our apologies for proceeding in what we know looks like the wrong way around. As mathematicians ourselves we certainly feel the same discomfort you do. But in this text we are not writing as mathematicians for other mathematicians, we are writing as teachers for students. Please bear with us.  Though this be madness, yet there is method in't.    Reference  Hamlet, Act 2, Scene 2     Some Preliminaries  In  Niccolo Fontana (1500-1557), also known as Targtaglia (The Stutterer), wrote a book titled Nova Scientia (New Science) wherein he analyzed the motion of objects moving under the influence of gravity near the surface of the earth as it was understood at the time.   There is much allegory in the title page of his book . Inside the large ring is a group of Muses surrounding Tartaglia and observing the trajectory of a cannonball. This represents the fact that this was one of the first works which studied the science of projectile motion using mathematical principles rather than empirical data and guesswork. At the door of the larger ring is Euclid, representing the notion that one can only enter through an understanding of Euclid's Elements (Geometry). Clearly the man trying to scale the wall does not understand Geometry. His ladder is far too short.  The smaller, slightly raised ring is occupied by Philosophia (wisdom) seated on a throne. Of course, the only entrance to the ring of philosophy, and therefore understanding, is through the larger ring of mathematics. At that gate are Aristotle (384-322 BCE) (on the mathematics side) and Plato (427-347 BCE) (on the philosophy side). On the banner is the motto of Plato's Academy , Let no one ignorant of geometry enter. Of course, such allegory is open to interpretation, but it seems pretty clear that Geometry (mathematics) would play an important role in the New Science .   Historical Background  In those days there wasn't a clear distinction between Geometry and mathematics.   The caption below the illustration means, The Mathematical sciences speak: Who wishes to know the various causes of things, learn about us. The way is open to all.   From the beginning of the Renaissance to the present day the use of mathematics to describe and analyze physical phenomena has become ever the more normal mode of analysis in science. At first the Geometry of the Greeks, including Trigonometry, was at the forefront, but as time went on newer methods were invented. Primary among these were Algebra and then, eventually, Calculus.  Algebra came first but it merged with Geometry to form what we now call Analytic Geometry. When Calculus was invented it supplemented, enhanced, and expanded its predecessors.  But none of the other fields of mathematics disappeared. Geometry, Trigonometry, Algebra, and Analytic Geometry remain very useful tools in science. But they have, in a sense, become subordinate to Calculus.  There are physical problems that are very difficult to solve using either Algebra or Geometry but which become relatively easy once Calculus has been mastered. Attempts to address those difficult-to-solve problems are what led to the invention of Calculus and several of the very ingenious techniques developed were very Calculus-like. In this chapter we will look briefly at some of these pre-Calculus techniques.   Warning: You may be tempted to disregard this chapter and get on to the Calculus part. This is an error. The story of Calculus, what sorts of problems it was invented to address, and why the tools of Calculus developed in the way that they did, will help you understand what Calculus is, and what it is not.      The Laziness of Nature  In order to apply mathematical principles to the study of physical phenomena we need to agree on some foundational assumptions which seem to govern the behavior of nature. A fundamental tenet that scientists use is this: Nature is lazy! That is, nature optimizes. It tries to do things in the most efficient (optimal) manner possible. The most common form such Optimization Problems take is to find the value of the independent variable (often denoted ) which makes the dependent variable (often denoted ) as large or as small as possible.  To illustrate the usefulness of this principle consider a beam of light bouncing off of a flat mirror. Empirical evidence (that is, evidence gained from measuring the angles) suggests that the angle of incidence is equal to the angle of reflection. However, no matter how many experiments we run there is always the chance that there is some configuration of lights and mirrors we've missed. A configuration where the angles are not equal.  Let's try a thought experiment.  We want to discover what path a beam of light would travel between the points and in the figure below assuming that it first reflects off of the line ( for mirror, not slope).   From our assumption that Nature is Lazy , it is clear that our task is to find the shortest path from to to That is, we have an Optimization Problem.    Comment  Actually we want to minimize the amount of time it takes to pass between two points, but for this problem minimizing the time and minimizing the distance are equivalent. The modern name for this idea is the Principle of Least Action.    Begin by reflecting across in our imagination and denote this reflection by    Next we reflect back across so that it falls onto , and we reflect those portions of the solid and dotted paths that are below line , in the same way.        Suppose we label the angles in the previous diagram as follows:    Explain why .    Explain why .    And finally, conclude that .    Thus the angle of incidence ( ) will equal the angle of reflection ( ) provided light adheres to the Nature is Lazy principle and really does travel by the shortest possible path.     If a spotlight is mounted at point , how far from point must point be so that the light will be reflected to point ? Justify your answer.      As long as it is not spinning sideways a billiard ball will bounce just like a beam of light. In the sketch below what must be to sink the ball into the side pocket at ? Make sure that you explain how you obtained your answer.     Another optimization problem that we can solve without Calculus (this time we'll use Algebra) is the following.   Maximizing Area  Out of all rectangles with a given fixed perimeter, which one encompasses the greatest area?  A reasonable guess is that the correct shape is a square. But a guess, no matter how much it feels right, is just a guess. We need a convincing demonstration.  To see that this actually is the correct shape, consider a square whose side is If is the length of one side then the perimeter of our square is (the fixed value) and the area is (also fixed). Suppose we now increase of two opposite sides the length by To maintain the same perimeter, we must now decrease the width by the same The area of this new rectangle is is but its perimeter is still .  Thus the square has a larger area than this rectangle with the same perimeter. Moreover, since we didn't specify a value for our conclusion holds for all possible values of . That is, every rectangle with perimeter has a smaller area than the square with perimeter .    DIGRESSION: Variables, Constants, and Functions  Digression Variables, Constants, and Functions  It is easy to have the impression that using a letter, like , to represent quantity automatically means that the quantity can vary that it is variable. This is not true. There are three situations in which a letter is used to represent a given quantity.   Variables:  For example, the area of a square is given by where is the length of one side. If we think of as a variable  if it can take on any positive value then this expression gives us the area of all possible squares.    Constants:  Sometimes letters are used to designate unchanging quantities  constants (also called parameters ) when the actual value of the constant is irrelevant. For example, the area of all rectangles where one side is some fixed value, say , but the other varies is given by where is variable as before. Since we don't care what the size of the fixed side is we don't choose a specific length for it. We just let represent that fixed size, whatever it is. The crucial fact here is that we have a rectangle, not what size the rectangle is.  The difference between variables and constants is mostly in the way we think about them. Constants are fixed, but unknown. Variables are not fixed.    Functions:  Sometimes a varying quantity depends on the values of one or more other varying quantities. In that case the dependent variable is said to be a function of the independent variable. We saw this above when we said the area of a rectangle with a fixed side length, , was Most often we would write this as The part of just tells us that that the dependent variable depends on is the independent variable . The name we give to the dependent variable ( in this case) usually serves double duty as both the name of the dependent variable, and the name of are also sometimes called functions. In this example is a function of .  If you are inclined to be persnickety, you can make a reasonable argument that if then depends on both and . And you'd be right. But the tradition is to only put variables inside the parentheses, not parameters.   These are simple distinctions now, but it will be useful for you to get in the habit of making sure it is clear in your mind what is variable, what is constant, and which variables are functions of other variables. As the problems get more complex and we need several variables, parameters, and functions, just untangling all of this can become problematic. Keep in mind that the distinction is purely in how we choose to think about a given symbol, not in how we manipulate it algebraically.  The following problem is a variation on Example and can be solved similarly.   Out of all rectangles with a fixed perimeter, which one has the shortest diagonal? Justify your answer.   As we mentioned above, Problem can be done in a manner similar to Example . But what about the following?   Consider all square based boxes with a fixed surface area . Does the cube enclose the largest volume?  To do this problem in the same manner as Example , observe that a cube with side would have a volume of and a surface area of . Suppose we change the lengths on the base from to . Notice that if then we will be increasing the lengths on the base and if then we will be decreasing the lengths. The only restriction is that so as to be a length. This says that . (In theory, we can make the lengths of the base as long as we wish.) To maintain a surface area of , we will need to adjust our height appropriately. Let’s call this new height .     Proceed as in Example to show that in order to maintain a surface area of , must be . Use this to show that the volume of this new box is How does this address the original question about the cube having the largest volume?    Why did we write in this rather peculiar way?     Problem shows that proceeding in this ad hoc manner is becoming more difficult. Difficulties of this kind are what prompted mathematicians in the seventeenth century to search for more systematic methods for handling such optimization. These techniques ultimately led to the invention of Calculus. We’ll come back to the this problem later in this chapter.  END OF DIGRESSION     Fermat's Method of Adequality     Pierre de Fermat 1601-1665    In its simplest form an Optimization Problem can be described as follows: Given that depends on , find the value of that makes as large (or as small) as it can possibly be.  For example, if then will be as small as it can possibly be when . The question is, how did we find ?  One of the mathematicians who developed techniques for solving optimization problems was Pierre de Fermat ( ) who created what has been called the Method of Adequalty . Fermat's method was based on the simple observation that if the maximum value of occurs when is equal to say, , then when is very near , will almost be equal to its maximum value.   Pronunciation  Fermat's name is pronounced fair mah , not fur mat.           Comment  Since there is only one number associated with each day of the year this should be a discrete graph. Since we'll be more interested in continuous functions we connect the dots to create a continuous approximation.   You can see this in the graph above. Notice that the maximum number of daylight hours (about ) occurs just after days (in fact, at day ) and that for several days before or after we have about the same number of hours of daylight. This is also true near the minimum which occurs at day Regardless of what the variables represent if the graph of a function, , is continuous the near a maximum or minimum: as long as is not too big.  Fermat's simple idea was to purposely make the mistake of setting actually equal means to equalize. When something is adequate, then it is equal to the need.} to . He then rearranged the formulas algebraically and at the crucial point he would set to make it correct. An example will make this clearer.   History  The Latin root adaequāre means to equalize. When something is adequate, then it is equal to the need.     In Example , we showed that out of all rectangles with a fixed perimeter, the one with the largest area is a square. Next we will use Fermat's Method of Adequality to examine the related question: Out of all rectangles with a fixed area, does a square have the smallest perimeter?  Consider a rectangle whose length is given by and width is given by The area of the rectangle is given by and the perimeter is given by   The problem is to minimize while holding constant. More precisely, our objective is to minimize the function , subject to the constraint that the area, , is fixed. First, we will use our constraint to eliminate one of the variables and substitute into . Solving for we get Then, We have used function notation for to emphasize that is a function of alone. (Remember that is constant or fixed. )  Fermat's method says to first set This gives: Rearranging a bit, we get so that Adding the fractions gives Finally, and crucially, dividing both sides by gives                 Earlier we had made the mistake of setting (knowing that this is not true). Now we make it correct by setting . This gives: Substituting this into we get   Thus is minimum when which is to say, when the rectangle is actually a square. A moment's thought should make it clear that there is no maximum value for   Fermat's method is very slick. However it contains an inherent logical flaw. We begin by setting equal to , even though we know we are making an error. This seems like it might be a flaw but it really isn't. When we set we are asking, What happens if they are equal? The computations leading up to equation are the answer to that question.  But notice that we got from equation to equation by dividing by From arithmetic you know that you can only divide by if is not zero. Fortunately it is clear that since the whole point of introducing is for and to be two different values. However, in the final step, after Equation , we took to make it correct but if is zero then we couldn't have divided by . We seem to be chasing our tails. We need for to be equal to zero and not be equal to zero at the same time!  This is the logical flaw.  Since we began with the assumption that we can't just change our minds later. We can't have both and .   Despite this logical flaw, Fermat's technique does seem to produce the correct answer. So let's explore it and see what happens.                              Drill shows that Fermat's method does not indicate whether the computed value of is at a maximum or a minimum. Often the context of the problem provides the additional information needed to make that determination. Example and Problem both provide such a context.    Consider a rectangular box with a square base, as seen here.          Find a formula for the volume, , and the surface area, , of the box.    Suppose we want to determine which box has the least surface area, given a fixed volume. What is our objective and what is our constraint? Use Fermat's Method of Adequality to find the dimensions of the box that solves this problem. Is the minimal box a cube?    A few minutes of thought should convince you that what makes Fermat's method work is the fact that near a maximum or minimum, the curve is practically horizontal. That is, its slope is nearly zero.  Fermat recognized that finding a maximum or minimum by his method was a special case of finding the slope of (the line tangent to) the curve and he modified his method to determine the slope of a curve even when it is not horizontal.  Before we pursue Fermat's modification, it might be a good time to brush up on some basics regarding the slopes of lines. No doubt you are already familiar with all of the following formulas for the equation of a line:          Slope-Intercept formula:     Point-Slope formula:      Two-Point, or Point-Point formula:            These formulas are all really just rearrangements of one another. We use three different rearrangements because in different contexts one of them is usually simpler to use than the others. Through most of Calculus you will probably find the Point-Slope version to be the most convenient to use.      Use the appropriate formula for the equation of a line to find an equation of each of the following lines:   with slope and -intercept     with slope and -intercept     with slope and -intercept     with slope and passing through the point     with slope and passing through the point     passing through the points and     passing through the points and       Show that the Point-Slope formula follows from the fact that the slope of a line can be determined using any two points on the line.   Show that the Slope-Intercept formula is really a rearrangement of the Point-Slope formula.   Show that the Point-Slope formula follows from the Two-Point formula.      What does the two-point formula reduce to if ?    What does the two-point formula reduce to if ?  Notice that in the two-point formula, as given we need to assume that . Can you rearrange the formula so that this is not a problem?      Show that the equation of the line with -intercept and -intercept can be written in the form: Notice that this equation is only valid if and    Determine the equation of the line if .    Determine the equation of the line if .                                                                                                  In the diagram below is obtained from by translating (but not rotating) , as indicated by the arrows. Use the diagram to show that parallel lines have the same slope.  In the diagram below we have taken from the previous figure, and rotated by . Use this diagram to show that perpendicular lines have slopes that are negative reciprocals of each other.                    Find the equation of the line:   parallel to and passing through    perpendicular to and passing through    parallel to with -intercept    perpendicular to and passing through the point                Find the equations of the two lines such that each one is a perpendicular distance of units away from the line and parallel to it.          Now that you've had a chance to brush up on slopes, let's see how Fermat modified his method to determine the slope of a curve. We will start by determining the slope of the graph of at the point    Comment  That is to say, the slope of the line tangent to the graph of at the point ..         We need two points to determine the slope of a line, so with Fermat's method in mind, we choose another point on the curve very close to Since we don't really care which point we take as long as it is close to we introduce the parameter, which we think of as very small. The points and are thus very close together. This is represented in the sketch at the right.  The slope of secant line joining and is given by As before we set . Thus the slope of the line tangent to the graph of at is            Use Fermat's method for tangents to compute the slope of the line tangent to at the generic point .    First plot the graph . Then, on the same set of axes, plot the line the line through the point , and tangent to the graph of , for each of .    What is the relationship between the slopes at and ? Is this consistent with what you see when you plot the graph of ?          Use Fermat's method for tangents to compute the slope of the line tangent to at the point     First plot the graph . Then, on the same set of axes, plot the line the line through the point , and tangent to the graph of , for each of . You should notice something interesting about the tangent lines at and     What can you say about the tangent lines at and ?                                                      Use Fermat's Method to find a formula for the slope of the tangent line to at the point . How does this answer compare with the results of the previous two problems?  What would happen if we used Fermat's Method to find the slope of the tangent line to at the point where is any constant? Does this make sense graphically? Explain.                  Descartes's Method of Normals    Renè Descartes (1596-1650)            As we noted earlier, while Fermat's Method of Adequality seems to work it has a fundamental logical flaw. Fermat's contemporary, Renè Descartes  , provided an alternative method in his book Discourse on Method which is free of logical issues. Unfortunately Descartes' technique is also very difficult to use and as we will see is of limited applicability.   Mathematical Vocabulary  The English word, normal comes from the Latin word norma which literally means a carpenter's square. In construction, it is important that vertical posts be perpendicular to the horizontal ground, so a vertical post is normal.   Descartes's method is often called the Method of Normals because what he actually finds is the line normal to (perpendicular to) a curve. Once the line normal to the curve at a point is obtained, the line perpendicular to the normal line will be tangent to the curve. Descartes' Method relies solely on the fact (from Greek Geometry) that at each point of a circle the radius and tangent line through the point are perpendicular. We'll illustrate Descartes' idea with the following example.                To find the slope of the normal (and, eventually the tangent) line to the graph of the curve at the point Descartes' approach was to look at the family of circles with centers on the -axis and passing through the point The sketch at the right displays several members of of that family of circles. Notice that each circle crosses the parabola at the point . We are searching for the center of the solid black circle which touches (is tangent to) the parabola at . If we can find the center of the black circle then the radial line through the point will be normal to the parabola at and the slope of the tangent line will be the negative reciprocal of the slope of the normal.  We now want to turn the geometric problem of finding the intersection of our circle and parabola into an algebraic problem. Let denote the coordinates of the center of a circle in that family, then the equation of the circle with center is where is the length of the radius of the circle and is a parameter. Since we require our circle to pass through the point the length of this radius will be the distance from to , Thus we have   Since we are looking for the point where and the circle intersect, we substitute into Equation ) to get   At this point it is tempting to use the Quadratic Formula to solve for and get (typically) two distinct solutions for in terms of . But the fact is we really don't care about the variable . We want to find the value of which ensures that the circle and the curve intersect exactly once.  Think about this for a moment. We get a single solution when we use the Quadratic Formula to solve this equation precisely when the discriminant (the part under the square root) is zero.     Use the Quadratic Formula to show that the discriminant of Equation ) is . Setting the discriminant in Drill equal to zero and solving, we get So the center of the circle touching the curve only once is at and the line segment from to is normal (perpendicular) to the graph of . Descartes and Fermat are generally credited with the invention of Analytic Geometry which is a technique that allows us to move problems from Algebra to Geometry or, as in this problem, from Geometry to Algebra.      Descartes would not have approached this problem using the idea of a discriminant as we just did. He knew that the only way the circle and the parabola could be tangent at is if is a double root of Equation ). Since a quadratic polynomial only has two roots, this means that Equation must be By comparing the coefficients of Equation ) and the right side of Equation show that .    Like any powerful tool, Analytic Geometry must be used carefully. Sometimes, as in this problem, the transition from Geometry to Algebra can generate algebraic solutions that have no corresponding geometric solution. An extraneous root is the most common example of this.   Extraneous Roots   Show that the roots of are and . Notice that when and we the parabola and circle will have two intersection points (as seen in the graph in Example ). When we get one positive and one negative root, but the parabola and the circle cross only at . How do we make peace with this apparent contradiction?    Look closely at the equation for the parabola. Can be negative?     Example illustrates that there is a significant difference between curves touching (curves that are tangent) and curves crossing (curves that intersect). Finding the line tangent to a curve is actually much more subtle than you would expect at first. But this is not the appropriate place to start that conversation so we will hold off until we reach .   Now that we've found the center of the circle tangent to the curve at , use this to find the equation of the lines normal and tangent to the curve at that point. Plot the curve and these two lines on the same set of axes to see if they really are normal and tangent to the curve.     Use Descartes' Method of Normals to find the slope of the line tangent to the curve at the point .      Use Descartes' Method of Normals to find the slope of the line tangent to the curve at the point and compare with Problem .    You may want to use circles that are centered on the -axis instead of the -axis.      Apply Descartes' Method of Normals to the line at the point What equation did you find for the tangent line? Does this make sense to you?    Descartes' Method, unlike Fermat's, is free of the logical pitfalls. But it is algebraically cumbersome because it requires that we find the double root of a polynomial. Double roots of quadratic functions like the one in Example are relatively easy to find. But for higher degree polynomials this can be a substantial problem. For transcendental functions like this problem is almost insurmountable without Calculus.    Roberval, Conic Sections, and the Dynamic Approach   Speed, Velocity, and Rates of Change  Descartes and Fermat were co-creators of Analytic Geometry the use of Algebra to solve geometric problems so their methods are simultaneously algebraic and geometric in nature. That is, their methods are static. There is no motion involved. But at it's heart, Calculus gives us a way of dealing with the properties of objects as they change. It is the mathematics of motion. So we will need to think more dynamically.  If quantity changes by each time quantity changes by we say that the rate of change of  with respect to  is .  For example, in a video game if your character gains one hundred hit points whenever you cast a certain spell we would say that the rate of change of your hit points is one hundred points per spell, denoted . If you gain fifty hit points every second time you quaff a potion we write or, equivalently, and we say that the rate of change of hit points with respect to quaffs is twenty-five. Notice how naturally the properties of fractions come into play: .  On the other hand if you lose hit points each time an enemy strikes you three times with a sword then your hit points are decreasing at a rate of . It is inconvenient to specify whether is increasing or decreasing verbally so we adopt the convention that a negative rate of change is decreasing and a positive rate of change is increasing.  Speed is the rate of change we are most familiar with in daily life. If you are driving on a flat, straight, road your speed is the rate of change of your position, , with respect to the passage (change) of time, . If your speedometer reads we say your speed is sixty miles per hour: , meaning of course that in one hour you will travel sixty miles. This is often abbreviated to mph. We will model a flat, straight, road as the -axis with the positive direction to the right, as is customary. Of course, on this flat, straight, road we could be going to the right or to the left. Since there are only two directions possible, we can again use negative numbers to indicate the direction of travel as depicted in the sketch below.    However if we are on a broad flat plain, as depicted in the sketch below we can travel in any direction whatsoever.    Notice that our sketch indicates that there are eight cars, all traveling at , but in different directions. That is, the speed of each car is . But it should be clear that a single number is not adequate to fully describe the motion of these cars. We also need to specify the direction of travel and simply using plus or minus is no longer sufficient.  When we specify the speed and direction of motion of some object we are stating its velocity . This can be difficult at first because in casual conversation we use the words speed and velocity interchangeably, so we tend to think of them as synonyms. But in a technical setting speed and velocity, while related, have different meanings. Speed is how fast we're going. In the sketch at the left the speed of all of the cars is . But their velocities are all different. The velocity of one car is to the north, the velocity of another is to the west, the velocity of a third is to the southeast, and so on.   Gilles Personne de Roberval  , a contemporary of Fermat and Descartes, used arrows to indicate the velocity of moving objects just as we have. The length of the arrow represents the speed of the object and the direction of travel is the direction that the arrow points. This works well in the kind of geometric arguments he used as it enabled him to develop a method for constructing tangents which is dynamic in nature.  Suppose you are on a moving sidewalk like those in an airport and the sidewalk is moving at . If you stand still on the sidewalk then you are still moving at .    If you are walking along the sidewalk at and in the same direction the sidewalk is moving then it is pretty clear that you are moving at a rate of .    Of course, if you turn around and walk against the sidewalk, then your speed would be .    If you are walking against the sidewalk but slower than the sidewalk is moving, say at , then you are again moving at but in the other direction.    Since there are only two possible directions all this could have been done without arrows by just adding signed numbers where the sign indicates the direction: , , , but what if there are more directions available?  Using arrows allows us to bring this discussion into a more general setting. In the examples above notice that the resulting velocity (the black arrow) was always obtained by attaching the tail of the green or red arrow to the head of the blue arrow.  This works equally well if more directions are available, like when we are moving in a plane instead of a straight line.  For example, suppose we are swimming across a river at a speed of and the river is flowing at . Assuming that we are swimming perpendicular to the current, we have the situation depicted below. \\centerline{\\includegraphics*[height=1.2in,width=2.4in]{..\/Figures\/Vector4}}   In the diagram above what does the length of the black arrow represent physically?   What is the length of the black arrow?             In general you can think of the velocity of an object moving in a plane as being compounded of a horizontal velocity (the blue arrow in Drill ) and a vertical velocity (the red arrow in Drill ). This is easiest to think about when the component velocities are perpendicular but this isn't strictly necessary. For example, you don't need to be swimming perpendicular to the current. As seen in the diagram at the right to find the result of two non-perpendicular velocities (the solid red and blue arrows) we need only form the parallelogram as shown. The resulting velocity is then represented by the black diagonal arrow.             Roberval assumed that a curve in the plane is generated by a point whose motion is an aggregate of two known motions, which can be represented as arrows. The arrows are then added by finding the diagonal of the parallelogram generated by the two arrows. This diagonal will point in the direction of motion at that point on the curve and will point tangent to the curve.   Suppose a point is moving in the plane so that its horizontal speed is unit per second and its vertical velocity is units per second as in the diagram at the right. Clearly our point is moving along the line .   Comment  Observe that is the algebraic representation of a horizontal arrow with length , and is the algebraic representation of a vertical arrow with length . Translating statements and concepts between Algebra and Geometry is the essence of Analytic Geometry.   If represents time in seconds and if the point starts at the origin, then its coordinates are given by and . Since both and are needed to locate the point we will join them together notationally like this:              You might quite reasonably ask why we've gone to all this bother just to have two different ways to represent a particular line: , and The difference is in how we think about the graph. When we write we are thinking of the entire graph. When we write there is an implicit understanding that ( )ime is passing and we are thinking about the motion of the point. Thus when the point is at when it's at .  Think of the line as a road. The formula describes the entire road, whereas the expression tells us the point's location on the road at any given time, .  The idea of representing velocities with arrows is quite a powerful and common technique for representing non-linear motion. Roberval used this technique to find the tangent lines of the conic sections (as we will soon see) as well as more general curves. Since Roberval's time this idea has been developed considerably beyond what Roberval did. In fact we are skirting the edge of some very deep ideas here. In modern terms these arrows would be called vectors . Vector Addition is then done by the Parallelogram Rule , which is essentially what we did with our arrows above: Form the parallelogram and find its diagonal. The full force of vector analysis was not available to Roberval, and we won't need it, so we will not take you any further down this path but we encourage you visualize velocities, and any other directed quantity, as composed of horizontal and vertical components whenever you can. You will see this representation in more detail later in your education and it will help if you have already begun thinking in these terms.     Suppose the position of a point in the plane is given by .    What is the horizontal speed of the point?    What is the vertical speed of the point?    What is the speed of the point in the direction of motion?    Compare the motion of the point in this problem to the motion of the point in Example .                   Suppose a point is moving along the line with a horizontal speed of unit per second.    Find a representation of the point's position in the form . \\comment{There are a variety of correct solutions here. You must find a representation and then show that it is correct. }    What is the speed of the point in the vertical direction?    What is the speed of the point in the direction of motion?                    Suppose a point is moving along the line with a horizontal speed of units per second.    What is the speed of the point in the vertical direction?    What is the speed of the point in the direction of motion?                Suppose the position of a point in the plane is given by .    What is the horizontal velocity of the point?    What is the vertical velocity of the point?    What is the velocity of in the direction of motion?                We drop an object from a helicopter which is traveling horizontally with a constant velocity of meter per second. After it leave the helicopter the vertical velocity of the object at time will be meters per second as in the following diagram:   Comment  This is because the acceleration due to gravity at the surface of the earth has been determined (by Galileo) to be  . We'll discuss this in more depth in Section .}              If Roberval's method works then the speed of the point at any time, , will be the length of the diagonal of parallelogram of velocity arrows at time . Find a formula for the speed of the point and any time       The Tangent Lines of the Conic Sections              Parabolas, ellipses, and hyperbolas are called conic sections, or just conics, because they were originally defined as the intersection of a cone with planes situated at various angles, as shown in the sketches at the right.  While interesting, the original geometric definitions won't do for our purposes because they are entirely static. There is no motion involved.   History  This is primarily because we depend very heavily on our modern algebraic notation, not because of any inherent flaw in the definition. Without any notation at all ancient Greek scholars understood the nature of parabolas at least as well as we do today. Possibly better.   The more modern algebraic forms are a bit better:  Parabolas     Ellipses     Hyperbolas     but they are also static.  To use Roberval's dynamic approach to constructing tangent lines to the conic sections we will resort to yet a third equivalent definition. We start with the parabola.    The Tangent to a Parabola   Roberval's view of the tangent to a parabola        As seen in , a parabola can also be thought of as the set of points, , in a plane which are equidistant from a fixed point, , called the focus of the parabola, and a specific line, , called the directrix of the parabola. Adopting Roberval's dynamic viewpoint, we can think of as tracing out the parabola by moving so that these distances stay equal to each other.        Use to explain why it must be that the speed at which moves away from must equal the speed at which moves away from .   Suppose these speeds were not equal. What would this say about the distances from to and from to ?    If represents the velocity of the motion of away from , and represents the velocity of the motion of away from , then according to Roberval, the diagonal, of the parallelogram is tangent to the parabola. Use the result of part (a) to explain why this parallelogram is a rhombus. (A rhombus is a parallelogram where the four sides have equal length.)    In the angle is between the arrows and We have also extended the arrow downward to form the angle with Given that the parallelogram in the previous figure is a rhombus, show that the two angles,  are congruent.               That and in the previous problem are congruent has an interesting consequence in optics. Imagine that the inside of our parabola is a mirror, and that a light source has been placed at the point As we have seen when light reflects off of a flat mirror the angle of incidence is equal to the angle of reflection. Since this mirror isn't flat the angles of incidence and reflection are measured from the line tangent to the parabola at the point where the light strikes the mirror. Thus the angle of incidence of a beam emerging from and striking the parabola at will be in our diagram and the angle of reflection will be It follows that a light beam emerging from and reflecting from the parabola at any point will follow a path parallel to the axis of symmetry of the parabola after reflecting from the interior of the parabola.  You can see this in action with your car headlights or a flashlight. The reflector is cast in the shape of a parabola and the light emitting filament is place at the focus, so all of the light which strikes the reflector gets reflected in that direction.              Now turn this around. Any light beam coming parallel to axis of symmetry and striking the parabolic mirror will pass through the focal point . The light is thus focused and the image appears larger. This fact was used by Isaac Newton in the seventeenth century to design a new, and better, telescope than the one used by Galileo a generation earlier. Galileo's telescope was based on the refraction of light as it passes through shaped lenses. Through his study of optics Newton learned that the magnification effect could also be achieved via reflection. It was his invention of the reflecting telescope that first brought Newton into scientific prominence.  The fundamental optical principle he used, a light beam traveling parallel to the axis of symmetry, after reflecting from the interior of a parabolic mirror, will pass through the focus of the parabola, is the underlying design principle of all reflective telescopes, large and small, today.  In fact, you use this every day. Since radio waves are a form of electromagnetic radiation, just like visible light, this is also a fundamental design point for both radar antennas, satellite cable TV dishes, and the antennas at the tops of cell phone towers.    The Tangent to an Ellipse       Geometrically, an ellipse is the set of points in a plane, the sum of where the sum of the distances from two fixed points (foci) is a constant. Following Roberval we can generate an ellipse by combining two motions: one away from one focus ( ) and one toward the other focus ( ) as in the sketch below.   If we set equal to the length of and equal to the length of , then is constant.  Because is constant it should be clear that the rate at which lengthens is related to the rate at which shortens. These rates of change are represented by the red arrows in our sketch.    Explain why the parallelogram in the sketch above must be a rhombus and use this to show that angle is congruent to angle     An argument very similar to the one used in Problem will work.    From Problem we see that any light ray, sound wave, etc., emanating from one focus of an ellipse will reflect off of the interior of the ellipse to the other focus.  A playful example of the reflective properties of an ellipse are the so-called whisper galleries. If you and a friend stand at the foci of a room in the shape of an ellipse you will be able to converse in whispers even if you are very far apart. This is because the sound waves from your friend's voice will spread out to the walls and then reflect back to the other focus, where you are standing. Naturally, the volume of sound from any single location in the interior of the ellipse will have dropped considerably in transit. However, since all of them travel the same distance to get to you they arrive at the same time and the volume you hear is the sum of all of the individual reflected volumes.              The whisper gallery shown above is next to the Oyster Bar in Grand Central Station, New York City. The young woman standing at the support column in the background on the left and the young man at the column at the right in the foreground are standing at the foci of the elliptical ceiling. Each can hear the other clearly even if they speak quietly.  There is another whisper gallery in Statuary Hall in the Capitol building in Washington DC. This room was originally the meeting hall for the House of Representatives. It is said that when John Quincy Adams was a representative he would eavesdrop on his political enemies by placing himself at one focus of the room whenever he saw them talking quietly at the other.   Vocabulary  Lithotripsy literally means rock grinding.    A more serious application of the reflective properties of the ellipse is used in modern medicine to treat kidney stones. The treatment is called Extra-corporeal Shock Wave Lithotripsy, and it works by generating shock waves at one focus of a reflecting ellipse. The reflective property of the ellipse then concentrate the waves at the other focus. Placing the stone, which is inside the patient's body, at the second focus allows the shock waves to pummel the stone into dust.       The Tangent to an Hyperbola  If an ellipse is the locus of points the sum of whose distances from two given points is constant it is natural to ask, What do we get when the difference of their distances is constant? That is the shape called the hyperbola seen in the diagram below.    As before, we set and equal to the lengths of and , respectively. An hyperbola has the property that is constant.    Explain why the parallelogram in the sketch above must be a rhombus and use this to show that angle is congruent to angle As before in our diagram the red arrows represent the velocity of in the direction from to and from to .               The hyperbola also has interesting reflective properties. If a beam of light is aimed at one focus it will reflect off of the hyperbola toward the other focus. This property can be used to further refine the design of reflecting telescopes and antennae. The figure at the right shows the design of Cassegrain antenna. The large, primary mirror on the left is parabolic and shares a focus with the smaller, secondary, hyperbolic mirror on the right. Light reflecting off of the primary mirror is directed at the shared focus on the right where it is reflected to the other focus at the primary mirror. A detection device is then placed at the secondary focus to collect the amplified signal.  Roberval's use of arrows to represent velocities provides an intuitive way to understand the reflective properties of the conic sections. Moreover, thinking of curves as being traced out in time it gives us a dynamical way of looking at curves. This was a viewpoint that Newton adopted in his version of the Calculus.      Snell's Law and the Limitations of Adequality:  When light passes from one medium to another, say from air to water, it bends. This property is called refraction. The physical law governing refraction is known as Snell's Law, named after the Dutch Astronomer Willebrord Snell  though it was accurately described before that time. In modern terms, Snell's Law can be stated as follows.   Snell's Law of Refraction  Theorem Snell's Law of Refraction  Suppose that light travels with a velocity of in the first medium and velocity in second medium, and that and are as seen in the diagram below.   Then the path that light follows satisfies Notice that if this says that and the path of the line would be a straight line.   A number of mathematicians, including both Snell and Fermat, gave derivations of Snell's Law, but we will focus on Fermat's method. To attack this problem, Fermat refined the Nature is Lazy assumption a bit. Instead of assuming that that light would follow the shortest path, he assumed that light would follow the path that takes the least time.  Notice that this is consistent with our observations concerning reflections from a mirror. In that case, the speed of light was constant so the shortest path was, in fact, the fastest path. But refraction occurs because the velocity of light changes when the surrounding medium changes.  Let's see what happens when we try to use Fermat's Method of Adequality to find this fastest path.    Assuming that the velocity of light is in the first medium and in the second, use the following diagram to show the time, , for light to travel along the path from to  is        Mathematical Vocabulary  Is it clear to you that we've used velocity in when we really mean speed? If not, think about it for a moment. We're really only interested how fast light travels in either medium, not in the direction it is going. This was the language used in the seventeenth century so it is accurate historically, but not mathematically. Unfortunately, it is still common to use these words interchangeably, even among folks who know better. This can be quite confusing for the beginner but there isn't much that can be done except be aware of the problem. Whenever you encounter either word pause of a moment and ask yourself if the speaker or author means velocity, which includes the direction of travel, or speed, which does not. It should always be clear from the context.   Of course the next step would be to use Fermat's Method of Adequality to minimize , but the square roots involved make the Algebra daunting to say the least. Despite these difficulties Fermat was able to show that is minimized precisely when Snell's Law holds.  Although it is possible to derive Snell's Law with the tools we now have it is very difficult so we won't attempt it here. Instead we will return to this problem in Chapter where we will complete the derivation of Snell's Law using the rules of Calculus. That will be much simpler.  It seems that our efforts to solve optimization problems using pre-Calculus techniques has hit an impasse. To be sure those techniques, and others of a similar nature, were very clever and it must be admitted that they yielded interesting and correct results. However for the most part they were ad hoc methods and quite limited in their applicability. We need a way to overcome these limitations.  This is exactly what the invention of Calculus in the mid-seventeenth century did. The title of Leibniz' first published work on Calculus makes this very clear:    A New Method for Maxima and Minima, as Well as Tangents, Which is Impeded Neither by Fractional nor Irrational Quantities, and a Remarkable Type of Calculus for This.    It is time for us to learn about this Remarkable Type of Calculus .   "

In modern terms these arrows would be called vectors . Vector Addition is then done by the Parallelogram Rule , which is essentially what we did with our arrows above: Form the parallelogram and find its diagonal. The full force of vector analysis was not available to Roberval, and we won't need it, so we will not take you any further down this path but we encourage you visualize velocities, and any other directed quantity, as composed of horizontal and vertical components whenever you can.

Alfred North Whitehead (1861-1947)      Woolsthorpe Manor as it appears today           Since the Covid-19 pandemic of the following story has become very popular. In an outbreak of Bubonic Plague (also called the Black Death) closed Cambridge University. One of the students, a young man named Isaac Newton , decided to continue his studies on his own at his country home in Woolsthorpe, Lincolnshire, UK. It was during this time that Newton worked out the basic principles of Optics, his Law of Universal Gravitation, and his version of the Calculus. He was under years old at the time.  When you're a genius you can do that.  The basic facts of this story are essentially correct. The Plague did close Cambridge University in , Newton was under , he did retire to Woolsthorpe, and he did investigate Optics and Gravitation during this time. The mathematics that he needed did not exist at the time so he invented it. Today we call it Calculus.  But telling Newton's story this way is misleading. It leaves the impression that he did all of these things during his two years at Woolsthorpe; sewed them up in a neat little package; bequeathed them to the rest of humanity and then ascended directly into heaven as a scientific demi-god.   Historical Note  To be sure Newton did a lot during his retreat to Woolsthorpe, and he was a scientific demi-god. But if he ascended into heaven he did it in the usual way in at the age of .     Isaac Newton (1642-1727)          This is not true. In fact, he continued to work on optics after returning to Cambridge, but did not publish his first results until . He worked on his gravitational theory until at least when he published the first edition of his book Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica (Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosopy).   Mathematical Terminology  It is usually just called The Principia .   Newton's story is often treated as inspirational but the fact that he did so much, so young seems to us (the authors of this book) more intimidating than inspiring. We are considerably older than and taken together we haven't done anything as impressive as Newton did in his youth.  But comparing ourselves to Newton is pointless. Newton was a true genius. We are merely ordinary people just like you. We didn't invent Calculus, and you don't have to either. Newton did that for us. Everyone since has merely had to learn it; a much less imposing task.  Well, almost everyone.  About ten years after Newton entered Cambridge University, and quite independently, Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz developed his rules for Calculus while employed as a diplomat in Paris from to He was years old at the time.    Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz (1646-1716)            Though their approaches are fundamentally different, the computational techniques they worked out were essentially equivalent. Newton's approach was dynamic. He was thinking about objects in motion: the moon, the planets, and falling apples. Leibniz was thinking about geometric relationships, more like Fermat or Descartes.  As a matter of pure logic it doesn't really matter which viewpoint is adopted. However, there are some situations where thinking dynamically (like Newton) is more helpful, and others where thinking geometrically (like Leibniz) is more helpful. Throughout this text we will switch back and forth, adopting whichever approach seems to us more advantageous for a given situation. You should too.  Newton was a private, almost secretive man. At first he didn't tell anyone about his invention and so Leibniz was first to publish a paper on Calculus in . We referred to his paper at the end of Chapter :    A New Method for Maxima and Minima, as Well as Tangents, Which is Impeded Neither by Fractional nor Irrational Quantities, and a Remarkable Type of Calculus for This.    From this rather imposing title we can infer that Leibniz was aware that his Calculus would empower mathematicians to more easily solve both old problems (like Snell's Law) and new problems alike.  In his paper Leibniz displayed all of the General Differentiation Rules you will see at the beginning of the next section. He called his computational rules Calculus Differentialis which translates loosely as rules for differences. In English this is called Differential Calculus .  Newton and Leibniz each created and used a notation that reflected his own viewpoint. Newton's notation has (mostly) fallen away over the years. Leibniz' notation is much more intuitive and has become standard in mathematics.  Both assumed that a varying quantity could be increased or decreased by an infinitely small amount. Leibniz called this an infinitesimal difference, or a differential and denoted it with the letter d  presumably for differential. So if is some quantity, then its differential, , represents an infinitely small increase or decrease in   To talk of infinitely small increments may sound strange to you. It does to most people, because it is in fact a truly weird idea. Johann Bernoulli described differentials this way:    . . . a quantity which is increased or decreased by an infinitely small quantity is neither increased nor decreased . . .   From Great Moments in Mathematics After 1650, Lecture 32   You may judge for yourself how helpful this is. Johann and his brother Jacob both learned Calculus from Leibniz, and both went on to mathematical greatness in their own right.  The idea of an infinitesimal was not new. Before the invention of Calculus mathematicians had been using the notion both successfully, and informally, for many years. Galileo and his students used them. So did Archimedes. The idea was in the air.   But the vagueness of the notion was very troubling. In fact, late in his life Newton attempted to repudiate the idea of differentials by founding his version of Calculus on what he called prime and ultimate ratios . Leibniz simply continued the tradition of using differentials and invented the notational formalism that we still use today.  Although neither of them could precisely answer the question, What is a differential? neither Leibniz nor Newton allowed this to hold them back. They developed their computational schemes, verified that they worked at least on the problems they were interested in and proceeded to use them to attack other problems. That was enough for them. Both men followed the example of their forebears and treated the notion of an infinitely small increment as a convenient fiction. Something that doesn't exist in reality but is useful as way to think about certain problems. We will adopt a similar attitude at least for now.  But this is mathematics. Eventually we will reach a time of reckoning when we must define our concepts clearly and precisely. All of them, not just the convenient ones.  The question What is a differential? cannot simply be swept under the rug and ignored indefinitely. Since everything we do will depend in a fundamental way on differentials, we must resolve this question or all of our work will rest on a foundation of shifting sands and we will never really know whether it is valid or not. If we do not proceed carefully, logically, from clearly stated first principles we can never truly know if what we are doing is valid.  Indeed, Newton, Leibniz, and generations of mathematicians since understood this very well and worked hard to either give rigorous meaning to the idea of a differential or to abandon it altogether in favor of some other concept. Newton's idea of prime and ultimate ratios was probably the first such attempt.      Abraham Robinson (1918-1974)           But it took some of the greatest minds in history nearly two hundred years to resolve the question of differentials.  Well, resolve might be too strong a word. The theory of limits, adopted in the late th century, doesn't resolve the matter as much as it simply avoids it altogether. You'll see what we mean when we come to Chapter   In the mid-twentieth century Abraham Robinson ( ) was finally able to put a develop the notion of a differential in a solid, rigorous manner. Unfortunately, to do this Robinson required some high level techniques from the field of Mathematical Logic which are quite beyond the scope of this text.  Besides, Calculus already had a rigorous foundation. The theory of limits had been established nearly a hundred years before Robinson's work and it provides an entirely adequate foundation for Calculus. Unfortunately, the theory of limits does very little to help anyone actually use Calculus. It simply provides rigor for the logical foundations. On the other hand the differentials of Leibniz and Robinson do provide aid in using Calculus. Newton, Leibniz, and their contemporaries did truly amazing things by treating differentials as convenient fictions . There is no reason we can't do the same.  For now we will follow the example of our forbears and develop the Rules For Differences ( Differential Calculus ) using Leibniz' differentials. In particular, we will not concern ourselves with the question, What is a differential?   There is precedent for this. The ancient Greek mathematician Euclid , (325BC - 265BC) defined geometric points with the phrase A point is that which has no parts. But that is simply a clever way of admitting that he didn't know what points are, despite the fact that they are enormously useful. What is a point, really, but a convenient fiction? And yet the notion of a point is foundational for all of Geometry. After all, what is a line but the relationship between two points? Moreover, mathematical points are highly intuitive and can be visualized in the mind's eye as long as we don't look too closely.  Differentials will play a similar role in Calculus.    Warning: Be Sure You Understand the Purpose of This Chapter   You've got to learn your instrument. Then, you practice, practice, practice. And then, when you finally get up there on the bandstand, forget all that and just wail.   Charlie Bird Parker , 1937-1955   Imagine a surgeon using a scalpel, an auto mechanic using a torque wrench, or a professional golfer swinging a club. These people endure countless hours of practice learning to use the fundamental tools of their trade. It is not fun, nor do they expect it to be. They do it in order to become so skillful that they can use their tools seamlessly; so they can focus on what they are doing, not how they are doing it. They don't think of the tool, they think of the task. The tool simply becomes an extension of their hands. In precisely the same way, the differentiation rules we'll be discussing in this chapter are the basic tools of your trade and you need to become so skillful with them that you can use them without thinking about them.   General Differentiation Rules  Table Differentiation Rules General     The Constant Rule   If is a constant then       The Sum Rule          The Constant    Multiple Rule     If is a constant then         The Product Rule         The Power Rule    If is a rational number then       The Quotient Rule        The computational rules in the table above are the basic tools of Differential Calculus. They need to become an extension of your mind. You need to be able to perform these calculations while holding a larger problem in your mind. Sometimes a much larger problem. You need to become so familiar with them that they become the simple part of bigger problems.  The purpose of this chapter is to give you practice with these computations; to give you a chance to internalize them before you have to use them in a larger context. For that reason we will be providing a lot of drill problems for you to practice on. Do them.   These drill problems are not important in themselves, but once we move past this chapter it will be assumed that you can compute a differential even if the computation is long and complex easily. If you have not given yourself enough practice here, you will struggle through the rest of this course. And the ones that come after. You may even fail.  So, right here, right now, resolve to do all of the problems in this chapter. Do them even if your instructor has not assigned them all. The more practice you get with this now, the less you will struggle later. Find other problems from other books and do them too. Make up your own problems. Practice until you can compute a differential with a quick glance.  This is important. We, the authors of this text, know what we are talking about. Listen to us. Your goal in this chapter is to completely internalize these differentiation rules. They need to become second nature to you. The work you do now, here, will pay off in the long run.    The General Differentiation Rules   . . . mathematical analysis is to the technical man merely a tool or instrument for doing his work, of which he must have not only the knowledge and understanding but also the expertness which he has with other tools.   Arthur S. Hathaway , 1855-1934    It is better to do the right problem the wrong way than the wrong problem the right way.   Richard W. Hamming (1915-1998)    The General Differentiation Rules are surprisingly easy to learn and remember. Moreover, despite the fact that we have six entries in our table there are really only three rules. The Constant Rule, The Sum Rule, and the Product Rule are fundamental. The other three, The Constant Multiple Rule, The Power Rule, and the Quotient Rule are straightforward consequences of the first three. We only state them separately for convenience.  We call these rules general because each one of them can be applied to a wide variety of expressions. In addition to the general rules there is a large set of specific rules that only apply to specific functions. We will come back to these beginning in Chapter   To begin, suppose a point is moving along the -axis. As in Chapters  and when we think of a point in motion we write to express the idea that the position , depends on the time, . At a specific time, , the position , is expressed as more compactly as and at time the position is ..  The (small, finite) change in is the difference between and : , and the (small, finite) change in is the difference between and  .  It is customary to denote these small, finite changes with the notation: We will denote infinitely small changes in and as and . The symbol is called the differential of .  Notationally, the distinction between and is small, but conceptually it is profound. When we write there is some measurable distance between and When we write the distance between and is immeasurably (infinitesimally) small.  If is changing in time, represents how much changes in an infinitesimally small increment of time . If the concept of an infinitely small increment troubles you (it should) it is safe, for now, to think of as a very, very, very,} small change in .  In general, if two variables, say and , are related we will be interested in asking (and answering) the question: If is incremented by how will be affected?  Now that we understand our notation the first differentiation rule is quite obvious. In fact, it is the same whether we are thinking of a small finite change or of a differential. If is unchanging, if it is not moving, then the (infinitesimal) change in between two different times is zero. It doesn't really matter whether we are talking about a finite or an infinitesimal . Both are zero because doesn't change. Thus we have the following rule:   The Constant Rule  If is a constant, then .   Compute the differential of the following.                                                     In we stated the Constant Rule using as the constant, in we used , and in we used . Does it matter what symbol we use? Explain.     The Sum Rule       Ad Hoc Proof  If and are infinitely close together, then Similarly if and are infinitely close together then Then: which verifies the Sum Rule.      Notice that like the Constant Rule, the Sum Rule is true regardless of whether we are talking about finite differences or differentials.  The Sum Rule is stated as if it only applies to the sum of two quantities. This is typical of mathematical writing. We tend to be minimalists so we don't state more than we absolutely have to. However, if the Sum Rule applies to the sum of two quantities it is straightforward to show that it also applies in the obvious fashion to a sum of three, four, or more quantities.        Show that    Notice how we placed the parentheses.    Show that     Explain how you would show that where is an arbitrary positive, integer.          Show that    Notice how we placed the parentheses.    Show that     Explain how you would show that where is an arbitrary positive, integer.              The Constant Rule was particularly simple since only one quantity was involved and it was unchanging. The second is only slightly more complex.   The Constant Multiple Rule  If is a constant then     Ad Hoc Proof  Suppose is a constant and is a variable. Since is the differential between infinitely close values of we see that the differential of is given by: which verifies the Constant Multiple Rule.       To get a sense of how we will be using differentials consider the line which is the graph of the equation . Let's differentiate both sides of this formula using the tools we have so far. Obviously if two quantities are equal then their differentials are also equal. So, . From the Sum Rule and the Constant Rule we have, and from the Constant Multiple Rule we see that,   Notice that equation can be rearranged as follows: So it appears that the differential ratio  is the slope of our line. This makes sense since is the (infinitesimal) change in divided by the (infinitesimal) change in . From your study of lines in Algebra you know that the change in divided by the change in is the definition of slope. It continues to be the slope even if the changes in and are infinitesimal.   Compute for each of the following:                                                                    In his paper on Calculus, Leibniz presented all of the General Differentiation Rules with no justification whatsoever, stating simply that    The demonstration of all this will be easy to one who is experienced in these matters . . .    Our first three rules seem to bear this out. They are really the same as the analogous rules for finite differences. His claim is a bit more suspect for the next differentiation rule.   The Product Rule       Ad Hoc Proof   Comment  We call these proofs Ad Hoc because they do not satisfy modern standards of rigor. Think of it as a reasonable, and (hopefully) convincing argument. We will address the question of formal rigor starting in    Think of the product as the (A)rea of the rectangle with sides of length and so that , as shown in the following sketch.   If we increase the sides by and , respectively, then the area will change by an infinitesimal amount which is the sum of areas of the blue, yellow, and red regions shown in the sketch. The area of the blue region is , the area of the red region is and the area of the yellow region is . Since is the sum of these three regions we have   But remember that and represent infinitely small changes. Thus, their product is even more infinitely small than they are. (Quadratically infinitely small?)  In fact, the product is so small compared to any of the other terms in Equation that it simply doesn't matter. So we will ignore it.  This leaves us with verifying the Product Rule.      You should feel at least a little uncomfortable with the logical sleight of hand in our ad hoc proof of The Product Rule . Some questions present themselves immediately: How can we choose not to ignore infinitesimals like and , but then choose to ignore their product ? What happens if or is negative? What happens if or is negative?  Perhaps Leibniz left out the demonstrations (proofs) of his rules because he knew they would be controversial. However, he was not lying when he said that those familiar with infinitesimals would understand. Newton also ignored products of infinitesimals in his version of Calculus. As we discussed in Section , it took mathematicians some years to sort this out. We will begin to address this problem in the . For now, we will simply accept that the Product Rule works as we've stated it knowing full well that we are on shaky ground that will eventually need to be firmed up.    Use the Product Rule to show that if , then .    Even though they could not fully explain their methods, both Newton and Leibniz could see that their methods gave answers that made sense physically and which agreed with the results of their predecessors. That is, their methods worked.  For example, in Problem you used Fermat's method for tangents to show that at the point the slope of the curve is and that at the point the slope of the curve is . Recall from Example that the differential ratio represents the slope of the curve. With this in mind we rewrite the formula from Problem as , from which we see that the Product Rule easily recovers Fermat's results.  But what can it mean to say that the slope of the graph of is ? The expression changes with but slope is supposed to be constant isn't it? Moreover, slopes have always been associated with straight lines in the past, but there is not a straight line to be seen anywhere in this problem.  Or is there?  The notion of a differential is essentially an extension of the following observation: If you look very closely at a curve it looks like a straight line. You can confirm this with any graphing technology. Graph a curve and zoom in repeatedly at any point on the curve. Eventually the curve will look like a straight line, and the slope of that line will be the value of at that point. If we extend this observation to the infinitely small scale we get differentials.  The idea that at the infinitely small scale lines and curves are indistinguishable is known as the Principal of Local Linearity , and it is a fundamental principle underlying all of Calculus. We will formally define the Principle of Local Linearity in Section . For now, the informal idea is that when you look at a very small section of a curve it looks like a straight line. When we choose to simply ignore the term in our development of the Product Rule we are invoking the Principle of Local Linearity   Comment  This is true but it is is not at all obvious.   Again, Newton and Leibniz relied on the fact that their methods produced solutions that made sense physically and which agreed with known solutions to old problems. Snell's Law is an example of the latter. The following problem is an example of the former.    When a rock is tossed into a quiet lake it generates an expanding, circular wave, as in the diagram below.   The area enclosed by the wave at any time is given by the formula: , where is the expanding radius of the circle. As time advances the radius of the circular wave expands and, as a consequence, the area enclosed by the wave also grows.    Use the Constant Multiple Rule and the Product Rule to show that     Explain why be the area of the yellow ring in the diagram is also equal to .    Find by cutting the yellow region at the dotted line, reshaping the ring into a rectangle. How does this compare with what we obtained using our Calculus rules. Do you see any logical issues with this solution? Specifically, why is it important that must be infinitely small?     DIGRESSION: Differential Notation  Digression Differential Notation  We will pause here for a moment to take explicit notice of the notational convenience we used in part (a) of because it will be useful later. We have used the expression to represent an infinitesimal displacement of , but it will be useful to think of the as meaningful in itself. That is, in the expression we think of the d as operating on the expression Thus when  operates on the expression it returns the expression and we have This is actually consistent with our previous usage if we think of as operating on the area and returning the differential   This is akin to the way we think about the square root symbol. The symbol  operates on the expression underneath it so we have Just as is always reserved for the square root of some quantity , is always reserved for the differential of some quantity . In both cases the quantity needs to be named. It is as meaningless to write as it is to write It is important to use the notation as it was designed to be used.  Also, notice that on the left side of we have the infinitesimal quantity, . Since the two sides of the equation are equal it follows that the quantity on the right side is also an infinitesimal. The obvious conclusion is that the ordinary real number multiplied by the infinitesimal must result in an infinitesimal quantity. Dividing both sides by we have , which seems to indicate that the quotient of two differentials will be an ordinary real number. Does this make intuitive sense to you?  Notice that we asked if it makes intuitive sense. When working with differentials it frequently happens that a statement feels right (makes intuitive sense) but begins to fall apart when examined more carefully.  END OF DIGRESSION     We mentioned earlier that the Constant Rule, the Sum Rule, and the Product Rule are fundamental, and that the other three can be proved using these three. Show that the Constant Multiple Rule follows from the Constant Rule and the Product Rule.     Find the Pattern       Compute each of the following differentials.                                      Do you see a pattern in the computations you did in Problem ? Assume is an unknown positive integer and use the pattern to compute:                                                                                                        Find the Pattern   By custom, differentials are written at the end of each term where they appear in a given computation so the Product Rule is usually written as But this is just a custom so it is not strictly necessary. We could also use the Product Rule in the form     Use the Product Rule twice to show that    The Product Rule requires two factors. But we have three: , , and . We can fix this with the substitution . Then Now use the Product Rule.    Emulate the computations in Part to show that.     What does the Product Rule look like for     Use the result of part (c) with to show that      Equation is called the Power Rule for Positive Integers .  Let's try out our differentiation rules on a relatively simple example. We will include every single step so that you can see how the differentiation rules are used in concert.    From the Sum Rule we have, Next, the Constant Rule, and the Constant Multiple Rule give, and by the Power Rule for Positive Integers we have,  Finally, factoring out the differential of gives,   Did you notice that the differential appeared in every term allowing us to factor it out at the end? When there is only one independent variable involved ( in this case) that will always happen. So it provides an easy way to check your computations.  If you end with an expression where the differential of the independent variable cannot be factored out then you have made a mistake in your computations. You should find your mistake before going on. Or just begin again.   As you become more skilled you will probably do many of the steps from in your head. But for now, notice how the rules work together and are applied as they are needed.    Here is another example without all the details spelled out. Make sure you see which rule is being invoked at each step.     Identify each of the rules used in each step of .   Of course, in we could have multiplied the factors together before differentiating and obtained the same answer: Either procedure will work. You are at liberty to do whichever you prefer.  Compute each of the following:                            Assume that is a constant.                                                                 Compute each of the following:              Assume that and are all constant.           Compute each of the following:              Assume that and are all constant.     % Do this problem by                Compute for each of the following:                                                               Compute for each of the following:                                                                                 15         Differentiating both sides of an ordinary algebraic equation yields a Differential Equation  an equation which relates the differentials of the quantities involved. For example, suppose we have a point lying on the unit circle so that the quantities and are related by the equation . Differentiating, we have the differential equation Let's look at this geometrically and focus on the first quadrant. The sketch at the left shows what happens to the quantities and as the point changes its position on the circle. The smaller triangle is called a differential triangle \\aside{Because all three sides are differentials, obviously.} and it is infinitely small. Differential triangles were a favorite tool of Leibniz. He assumed without justification (as we will, for now) that they are just like ordinary (finite) triangles. Notice that is negative since the coordinate is moving to the left, and that is positive since the coordinate is moving upward. We need positive quantities to represent the length of the triangle's legs. Therefore we use to represent a positive length for the horizontal leg of our differential triangle. A little more mysterious is the (correct) observation that the smaller triangle isn't really a triangle at all. Because it is part of the circle the line connecting and  the hypotenuse of the triangle is curved. But there is nothing lost by thinking of the hypotenuse as a straight line because according to the Principle of Local Linearity at an infinitely small scale lines and curves are indistinguishable. At least in part, this why Newton, Leibniz, and their contemporaries worked with differentials. At that scale they could replace curves with straight lines. % A little further on we will state the         Show that the two triangles in the diagram above are similar. Use this to show that Notice that this problem specifically asks you to use the triangles, not differentiation to show that     After we observed that the ratio must represent the slope of both the curve and its tangent line at a given point. Notice that the differential equation for the circle can be written as Explain how this is related to the geometric fact that the tangent to a circle at a point is perpendicular to the radius through that point.                            Brute Force Computation  Suppose we wish to find when . One way to do this is simple brute force. That is, we compute Applying the Sum Rule we see that Next we use the Constant Multiple Rule, to get In the end we have,   Brute force works but expanding an expression like is dull (and error prone) and mathematicians are like Nature: We are lazy. We'd really rather avoid doing all of that dull computation if we possibly can. Wouldn t you?  Suppose, we make this problem a little easier on the eyes with a substitution like we did in . Let . Then our original problem becomes which is much easier to look at. And now . Substituting back in for we get After computing we see that           Complete by showing that we get the same both ways.    Compute if and then solve the equation for . (This problem is completely contrived. There is no obvious reason that we would want or need to solve this equation. However, in the near future this will be the next step in many of the problems we will encounter.)                   Making Things Easier on the Eyes  Suppose we wish to find when Once again we could just apply brute force by multiplying out the expression But this is a lot of work and it is very error prone.  Instead notice that is the product of and so the Product Rule seems a likely place to begin. But first we make it easier on the eyes with the substitutions, , and . Thus: Using the Product Rule we now have and so   Not only does this involve considerably less Algebra (and is thus less prone to error) it also gives us in a form that is easy to factor. This is important because, as we mentioned in our comment to , many of the problems to come will involve finding a differential, setting it equal to zero, and then solving the resulting equation. If we had computed this by brute force we would have to find the roots of a fully expanded fourth degree polynomial. That would be hard. The form given above is much easier to work with. Let's go ahead and set and solve the resulting equation: just for practice.  The prospects for solving the equation, even in this form seem pretty glum at first, but it really isn't so bad once we notice that and appear as factors in both terms on the left hand side. Factoring these out gives so that  so that     Complete this example by finding all solutions of the last equation.    Compute the differential of and solve for .   As you become more comfortable using these differentiation rules together, you will probably do many of the steps in a long differentiation more informally, perhaps even in your head. However, most of the time differentiation will only be one part of much larger problems. If you don't differentiate correctly whatever you do after that is wasted time and effort. It is better to proceed slowly to be sure you are right. If it helps to write out each step in detail then you should certainly do that.  At this point we can find the differentials of a large number of algebraic expressions. But not all. For example suppose Nothing we've done so far tells us what is.   However, you are surely aware that the radical symbol, , can be expressed as a fractional exponent. For example, It is tempting to simply assert that, by the Power Rule, In fact this is true, but it doesn't follow from the way we developed the Power Rule because we depended quite explicitly on the assumption that the exponent of is a positive integer.  Here's one way to prove that the Power Rule works when . If then Computing the differential of both sides gives: or which is the Power Rule with .   This example is more important than it appears to be. What it shows is that the Power Rule can be extended to include at least the case where the exponent is . In fact, the Power Rule is easily extended to allow the exponent to be any positive fraction, say for example.   You should be a little bit surprised at this. After all, is a complicated thing, compared to , or even . Nevertheless, essentially the same procedure works here too. If , then . Differentiating both sides gives and solving for leaves us with This is not yet recognizable as the Power Rule primarily because we need to express the right side entirely in terms of . But recall that so that . Making that substitution gives which is the Power Rule with         Mimic the process in Examples and to show that     Now suppose where and are positive integers and show that                  Having seen that the Power Rule can be extended to include positive, fractional exponents it is natural to ask if it can be extended to negative exponents Can we find the differential of ? Of course we can. If then By the Product Rule we have and thus So the Power Rule works for as well.     Let be a positive rational number and . As in  clear the fraction and use the Product Rule to obtain the Power Rule for negative rational numbers:      Use the formula you found in \\ to show that    Thus we see that the Power Rule holds for any rational number, positive or negative, which gives us The Power Rule for Rational Numbers : Let and be any integers, positive or negative, with . Then .  We can now differentiate some pretty complicated expressions. Frequently an appropriate substitution will make this easier on the eyes but otherwise at each step only need to invoke one of the General Differentiation Rules. When the expression is complicated the key is to be methodical and do one step at a time even if you are doing some of them in your head.    To differentiate we begin by re-expressing the radicals as exponents because we have no differentiation rules for radicals. Be sure you can follow all the computations at each step in Example . You may want to make some substitutions as you go. With practice, you will be able to do most of this in your head.    Show that the formula above simplifies to Does this seem simpler to you?   Compute in terms of and     where      , where      , where , and     Compute in terms of and     where      , where      , where , and             Compute each of the following:                                      Compute each of the following.                                                                                                                                   Compute for each of the following:                                        , where is a constant If , , and are spatial coordinates, is time, and the constant is the speed of light then the expression on the left-hand side represents the square of the distance between the origin and the point in dimensional, relativistic, spacetime. Setting this equal to zero allows us to identify all of the events that an observer at the origin is observing at a given instant. For example, if there is a solar flare happening on the sun million miles away from the earth, then we observe it minutes later. The spacetime distance is zero to allow for the simultaneity of the event happening and us observing it. The closest galaxy to the Milky Way Galaxy is the Andromeda Galaxy which is approximately million light-years away. This means that the light we are observing now originated 2.5 million years ago but the spacetime distance between the two events (called the Minkowski distance) is still zero. .                                                                                                                                     In most of   is given explicitly in terms of . But is given implicitly in part (j). We've seen this before. Almost everyone's first impulse in this situation is to try to solve explicitly for and then differentiate, but solving for isn't necessary, it isn't always possible, and even when it is possible it is often harder that simply differentiating the formula we re given. Our differentiation rules remain unchanged. After completing the differentiation we simply need to solve for .   For example, how can we compute given that It is possible to solve this explicitly for but it is difficult and the complexity of the computations tends to hide the underlying simplicity of the larger problem. Since  is quadratic in (the highest power of is ) we need only use the Quadratic Formula to get explicitly in terms of and and then differentiate. Try that some time when you have time to kill. Lots of time.  Instead, we'll just apply our differentiation rules to  as it is. Differentiating we have At first this may look very difficult to solve for but look again. This dirfferential equation is actually linear in each of the differentials, , , and . That is, each differential only appears raised to the first power. This will always happen. When we differentiate any expression the result will always be linear in the differentials involved.  We can rearrange our equation algebraically so that it has the following form. Solving for gives   For this example the specific computations are:   At this point we have solved our problem so we needn’t do any more. But notice that we could also write this as .  Some problems are legitimately hard, and some only look hard. So remember that as bleak as things may look sometimes, you should always keep your goal in view. In this case we were trying to isolate , so we gathered all of the terms that had in them, put all the other terms on the other side of the equation, factored out the and divided by the stuff that formed the coefficient of . This process is often easier than trying to solve for before differentiating.    Solve equation for and .    Compute for each of the following. (You will see these formulas again in  .)                                                    The Generalized Power Rule  Let's try out our differentiation rules on a relatively simple example. We will include every single step so that you can see how the differentiation rules are used in concert.    From the Sum Rule we have, Next, the Constant Rule, and the Constant Multiple Rule give, and by the Power Rule for Positive Integers we have, Finally, factoring out the differential of gives,  Next, Constant Rule, and the Constant Multiple Rule give, and by the Power Rule for Positive Integers we have,  Finally, factoring out the differential of gives,   Did you notice that the differential appeared in every term of Equation , allowing us to factor it out at the end? When there is only one independent variable involved ( in this case) that will always happen. So it provides an easy way to check your computations. If you end with an expression where the differential of the independent variable cannot be factored out then you have made a mistake in your computations. You should find your mistake before going on. Or just begin again.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        In the title of his paper Leibniz claimed that his Calculus Differentialis was . . . Impeded Neither by Fractional nor Irrational Quantities, . . .  But notice that nothing we've done so far allows us to differentiate, say , since is irrational and cannot be represented as a fraction. Having an irrational exponent is a bigger problem than it seems to be.  Take a moment and ask yourself what an expression like could even mean.   Warning!  No! No! No! Wait!  Don't keep reading as if we didn't just tell you to stop. We're serious. Take a moment and think about this. How do you multiply copies o\/f together? Does that even mean anything? If so, what?   We clearly have no way (so far) to interpret the meaning of an expression like . So trying to find its differential using the techniques we have is hopeless. In Chapter we will find a way to give meaning to and other such expressions. (Actually, we will invent it. Meaning is not something we find, it is something we create.) When we do we will find that the Power Rule still works. In the meantime, we will assume for now that the Power Rule always works, even when the exponent is irrational.   The General Power Rule  Let be any real number. Then .    Suppose we wish to find when . Rewriting this slightly we have . From the General Differentiation Rules we have:   Now suppose we have . Can we compute ? (Be sure you see why the previous approach won't work.)  There are actually two different approaches to this problem that use the Product Rule. The first is to rewrite as then apply the Product Rule followed by the Power Rule.  The second approach is to clear the fraction so that . From here we can compute the differential of both sides (using the Product Rule on the left side) and solve the result for .     Compute by each of the two methods indicated in Example . Verify that your results are equivalent either way.    Both of the techniques in Example are straightforward and can be applied to any fractional expression. Because this can become a bit cumbersome we will calculate once and for all. This will give us a convenient shortcut to handle fractional expressions called the Quotient Rule.

Isaac Newton (1642-1727)    As we observed in Newton, Leibniz, and their contemporaries extended the Principle of Local Linearity to its logical limit. They said if you cut out an infinitely small section of a curve then the section actually is an infinitely short straight line segment. Of course we are quite familiar with infinitely short line segments. We call them differentials.   Leibniz called a triangle whose sides are differentials, like the blue triangle in the figure at the right, a differential triangle    Comment  Because, what else would you call it?   In the figure and are differentials in the vertical and horizontal directions, respectively. But is a differential at the point in the direction of the curve or, what comes to the same thing, in the direction tangent to the curve. Thus is a differential along the curve, and simultaneously along the line tangent to the curve   Comment  The idea that the differential of is a straight line segment on the curve and also on its tangent line is a bit troubling. It is one of many bizarre consequences of the notion of differentials.   Notice that from the Pythagorean Theorem we have We will find Equation very useful.  The differentials , and , don t really tell us much about the graph of , but the differential ratio , , does. At each point, , gives us the slope of and the line tangent to the curve at that point. Loosely speaking, the differential ratio gives the slope of the curve at each point.  If we want to find the slope of the curve at the point we simply find as usual: . Then we take the extra step of dividing through by to get . Evaluating this at the point , , and which will give us the slope of the line tangent to the graph of at the point .  Find an equation of the line tangent to the graph of at each of the following points. Compare these results to those obtained using Fermat s Method in                                    DIGRESSION: Evaluation Notation  We will frequently need to evaluate the expression at different points. This can quickly become very confusing unless we have some way of indicating which point is under consideration. To avoid confusion, we use the notation or just when there is no ambiguity. This notation is very flexible. Frequently the coordinate will not be in play. In that case we write to indicate that we are evaluating at the point .     For example to compute the slope of the graph of at we use the following three-step process.     First differentiate to obtain the differential equation . This relates and .    Second, from this differential equation we find the ratio This differential ratio tells us the slope of the curve at every point on the curve.    Third, if we need the value of at a single point like , for example we compute    Mathematical Notation  Obviously this makes no sense if the point is not a point on the curve. You should always make sure the problem makes sense before you try to solve it.   In this case we could just write: , since the coordinate never comes into play.  Finally, we emphasize that Leibniz notation is deliberately evocative of the notion of slope because when we evaluate the differential ratio at a point it tells us the slope of the curve at that point. In view of the Principle of Local Linearity , this is equivalent to finding the slope of the line tangent to the curve at that point.    This notation probably seems unnecessarily cumbersome and honestly, in some ways it is. But be assured we have not made this choice lightly, and this notation has certain advantages that will become apparent later.  It can be easy to get careless or simply confused and write when you mean , and vice versa , so it is important that you have the distinction between them clear in your mind.        Explain the difference between and carefully and clearly.    We (the authors) have sometimes had students assert that since , the equation of the line tangent to the graph of at the point is Set . Is this the equation of a line?    Find the correct formula for line tangent to the graph of at the point .

There is real temptation at this point to cut corners and compute the differential ratio all in one step. On purely practical grounds, we urge you to differentiate first and then divide by in two separate steps. Our reasons are two-fold. First, the rules we ve learned are differentiation rules. They were designed to compute differentials, not differential ratios. Second, in applications to come we will see that dividing by will not always move the solution process forward. It can sometimes even get in the way, depending on the problem.  Nonetheless, as you gain more experience and a deeper understanding you will find yourself gravitating toward the differential ratio more and more. This is a normal progression. As we have said before differentials are an intermediate step, a convenient fiction. You don t want to become tied to them for life.      Defining the Tangent Line   The word tangent comes from the Latin word tangere (to touch). So you d think it would be easy to define what we mean by tangent line. When asked, most people will come up with something like, The line tangent to a curve is the line that touches the curve at exactly one point. Does this seem like a reasonable definition to you? Stop and think about it for a few minutes. We re obviously offering a plausible sounding definition that we know won t work. Do you see the problem?  It certainly seems OK, and if we check it with a few simple examples everything looks reasonable. But consider a small segment of the graph of at the point and its corresponding tangent line as seen at the left.   While this certainly fits our notion of a tangent line touching a curve only once, look what happens if we zoom out (see the sketch at the right). This supposed tangent line will cross (touch) the graph of the curve a second time. In fact, there is only one point on the graph of where the tangent line touches the graph only once. Do you see which point that is? Give this a few minutes thought.  In view of what we ve just seen, what do you think the definition of a tangent line ought to be?  In the figure at the right it is clear that the touching is different at the two points. At the blue tangent line grazes the graph of at exactly as we would expect. But at the other point it actually cuts through the graph.  The difficulty seems to be that we said touch when we meant graze . How about this definition instead: The line tangent to a curve is the line that grazes the curve at exactly one point.   If it is not possible for a line to graze a curve at more than one point this could be a workable definition. Unfortunately the next drill shows that this is not true.    Show that is the equation of the line tangent to the graph of at and as seen in the sketch above.    It appears that clearly defining what we mean by tangent line is not as simple as it seemed to be at first. This is frustrating because we all have a pretty clear intuitive idea of what we mean. The difficulty seems to be capturing in words the mental image we all share.  Recall that we have informally stated the Principle of Local Linearity as: Locally any curve is indistinguishable from a straight line.   But which straight line?  The answer to that question is visible in the differential triangle at the left. It is clear that, locally (near a given point on the curve) a curve will look like the hypotenuse of the differential triangle at the point . So we make the following definition.   The Line Tangent to a Curve at a Point   The line tangent to a curve , at the point is the line which passes through the point with slope .    Do you see what we did here? Intuitively we know what properties we want a tangent line to have. We want it to touch or graze our curve at a particular point but we ve seen that neither of those words quite captures everything we need. And what we need is for the tangent line to pass through the tangent point and have the same slope as the function at that point. So we ve removed the words touch and graze in favor of the more precise, quantifiable language of Calculus.  Since we defined the tangent line to be the extension of to the finite scale we have essentially defined it to have exactly that property we will need to make Differential Calculus useful. Moreover with this definition in place the Principle of Local Linearity can be formalized a bit more.   The Principle of Local Linearity   Sufficiently close to a given point every smooth curve is indistinguishable from the line tangent at that point.    The history of mathematics is riddled with this sort of backward looking definition and we will see it again. For example Newton and Leibniz both knew what they wanted their Calculus Differentialus (Leibniz) and Method of Fluxions (Newton) to do. They worked out their computational procedures intuitively just as we started with an intuitive understanding of tangent line. But coming up with precise definitions and a solid logical foundation was harder. It took about years for the mathematical community to devise definitions that gave back what intuition had led us to. This is part of why we are not yet overly concerned about our inability to precisely define a differential. When we finally address this issue in Chapter we will not be devising any new differentiation techniques. We will be providing logical underpinnings for the techniques our intuition has led us to and that our experience has shown to be useful.

Now graph the curve and the line tangent at on the same set of axes. Does this look like a tangent line to you?    Does the graph help you see the significance of ? The line tangent to the graph of at the point actually crosses the graph at that point. This is weird. And it is exactly counter to our original understanding of what it means for a line to be tangent to a curve isn t it?  The next problem will probably strike you as equally weird. But in both problems the weirdness is a logical consequence of our definition of tangent line, so we will accept it as long as it doesn t lead to inconsistencies.  Weirdness is acceptable. It is inconsistency that we need to avoid.    Use Definition to find the equation of the line tangent to the graph of the straight line at the point .

In it is tempting to to say that will give us the slope of the tangent line tangent to the curve at any point Typically this would be correct. But not always. For example the tangent line of this curve is horizontal (has slope equal to zero) when          Solving this gives . It is plainly visible on the graph below that there is a horizontal tangent line when . But notice that there is no point on the graph where ! Obviously it is meaningless to ask for the slope of a curve at a point that isn t on the curve.   Even if we didn t have the graph to look at we could still tell that at there is no tangent line. Setting and trying to solve for the corresponding values we get . Since there is no real number that satisfies the equation we conclude that there is no point on the graph with -coordinate equal to .  On the other hand, there are three values of that correspond to . These would be difficult to compute but from the graph we can see that the tangent line is most likely vertical at all three points. To compute at each of these points we would have to divide by .  Obviously when we divide a number by zero we get infinity, and just as obviously the slope of a vertical line is also infinity so everything fits. Right? No, of course not. This is just a very deceptive coincidence.  Many students come into a Calculus with the impression that dividing by zero results in either zero or infinity. It does not. Division by zero is not meaningful.  Mathematicians say that division by zero is an undefined operation or simply that it is undefined . At first it is not at all clear why this is, so let s take look at this question.   Comment  The units could be inches, picometers, or light-years. We don t care.   What does it mean to divide by any number? To take a very concrete example, what does it mean to divide a length of five units by seventeen? It means we want to divide the length into seventeen equally sized pieces, right? But if we want to divided units by zero, obviously we can rsq\/>t divide five into zero pieces. So in this very concrete example the phrase five divided by zero is simply and utterly without meaning.  From a slightly more abstract viewpoint we could ask for the length of each piece when we divide a length of five into seventeen pieces. We get of course. That rsq\/>s what the fraction notation means   Comment  Just as is the number we get when we divide one into two pieces.   But what number do we get when we divide five into zero pieces. Once again the idea has no meaning.  Taking an even more abstract point of view, observe that multiplication and division are inverse operations (they undo each other). Twelve divided by three is four precisely because when we multiply three times four we get twelve ( ).  Now don t think of five as a length to be divided, think of it instead as simply a number. So what number can we multiply by zero to get five? Obviously there isn t any such number so this is a meaningless question.  No matter what we try or how we look at it we cannot find any way to make division by zero meaningful.  Since we can t divide by zero we will need to be a bit more careful about how we interpret the symbol . It will give us the slope of the curve (equivalently, the slope of the tangent line) as long as has meaning. But when is zero is meaningless. Thus it appears that for this particular curve we can draw no conclusions whatsoever from our formula about the tangent line when . In this case we say that the differential quotient is undefined . In general, the differential quotient is undefined at any point where evaluating requires a division by zero.  Does this mean we can draw no conclusions at all? Certainly not. In fact those values of or where is undefined will often turn out to be the most useful. But we are not yet quite prepared to see how to deal with them properly so we will defer this discussion until a later point.  At the very least this warns us that there are subtleties that must be dealt with when using a powerful tool like Calculus. We will avoid these subtleties for a bit longer, but you need to know that they exist. Don t try to force matters by, for example, blindly dividing by zero as if it is meaningful. We will return to these matters when we have a better understanding of the underlying principles.  END OF DIGRESSION     Suppose that the two blue line segments in the figure below are parallel.

Have you looked at the graph yet?}    These last three problems illustrate that while many otherwise difficult computations can be done in these lines, as if by magic (to quote Leibniz) there are still a great many subtleties to be accounted for. There is still plenty of room for creative, analytical problem solving.  We will come back to some of these subtleties later. For now keep in mind that while Calculus is a very powerful tool it does not allow us to solve all problems blindly, by simply moving the pebbles.    The Vomit Comet  To acclimate astronaut trainees to the effects of weightlessness, NASA uses the following training regimen: It has an airplane perform a series of steep climbs and sharp dives. At the top of each climb passengers will experience weightlessness for about seconds. During a training flight the pilot will repeat this maneuver about times.          Because this roller coaster ride sometimes causes nausea for the passengers the planes used for the maneuver have been christened Vomit Comets. One of these airplanes was used to film the weightless scenes in the film Apollo 13 .  It is well known that the path of an object moving only under the influence of the Earth s gravity at the surface of the earth is parabolic. To simulate weightlessness inside the plane the Vomit Comet is flown so that its flight path matches such a parabolic flight. That is, its shape will be the graph of a curve having the form    Comment  More precisely, to create neutral buoyancy.   We d like to find the values of the unknown parameters , , and that match the path of an object moving under the influence of Earth s gravity. Once these are known we will also be able to determine the peak altitude of the flight and how far (horizontally) it will go before coming back to the altitude where the maneuver began. That is, we can find the point where the pilot should pull out of the dive. Finally we d like to confirm the claim that this maneuver takes about seconds.  Can we find , , and ? No. Unfortunately we don t yet have enough information to determine , but we can find and .    Suppose the following graph depicts the parabolic flight path followed by the Vomit Comet as it starts its maneuver at an altitude of meters and an initial angle of elevation of .    If the equation of this parabola is then determine the values of and .    Ultimately to find , we ll need to have a better model of the motion. Fortunately, Calculus is exactly the right tool for building such a model but we don t yet have all of the pieces we need. We will return to the Vomit Comet problem once we have them.  The pilot of a Vomit Comet seeks to simulate weightlessness, but the pilot of a commercial airliner works hard to avoid subjecting its passengers to extreme effects like weightlessness or, at the other end, of extreme gravity so it must descend more gradually. This situation is a little easier to understand so we will explore it in the next couple of problems and examples before returning to the Vomit Comet.     Modeling the flight path of an airliner  We want to model the flight path of a plane as it lands and determine the distance from the runway the plane should be when it starts its descent.  A fundamental tenet of mathematically modeling real world phenomena is to keep things as simple as possible. So, the first thing we d be likely to try for is a parabolic descent path: But it is pretty clear that this won t work because the plane should be traveling horizontally at the beginning and at the end of its descent. At the end, because at that point it should be on the ground, and at the beginning because we don t want to terrify the passengers.    Show that there is only one point on any parabola where the line tangent to the curve is horizontal. Explain why this proves that the flight path of the airliner in cannot be parabolic.   Wherever the flight path is horizontal its slope will be zero.   The next simplest curve we could use would be a cubic polynomial     Below is a section of a cubic polynomial depicting a flight path with the plane starting initially at the point and ending at the airport which we will arbitrarily designate as the origin.      Assuming that the flight path is the graph of , compute . Then divide by to obtain .    Show that in equation ).   The point is on the graph of equation .}    Show that in ).   The flight path is horizontal at .}    Determine the values of and in ) in terms of and .   The point is on the flight path and the flight path is horizontal at .}    We ve taken our analysis of the flight paths of both the Vomit Comet and our airliner as far as we can using slopes alone. The problem is that a flight path is like a road. A road doesn t go anywhere. It just sits there. But an object traveling along a road (or a flight path) is moving. It has a velocity and an acceleration.  Analyzing a static path does not allow us to model either the velocity or the acceleration of an object moving along that path. Fortunately for us, Newton s formulation of Calculus is just what we need to attack these problems.  But since the Vomit Comet aims to replicate the path of a body falling freely under the influence of gravity we will also need to consider the influence of gravity.      Galileo Drops the Ball    Galileo Galilei {1564-1642}     In the previous section we asserted with no justification whatsoever that the flight path of the Vomit Comet would be parabolic. Then, in Problem , we gave you the task of finding the constants , and for which the graph of the curve is the flight path of the Vomit Comet with an initial angle of elevation of . You should have obtained   Inside the airplane, we want what is called neutral buoyancy . This means that we don t want any forces pushing us up or down, side to side, or back and forth relative to the airplane   Comment  Naturally, if the plane and everything in it are falling towards the earth then the force of gravity is in play. But if everything falls together there is no force inside (relative to) the plane.   The way to assure this is to force the airplane to fly along the same path it would take if it were unpowered and falling freely. At first it might seem like all we have to do is shut down the engine, but that won t work because air resistance will prevent the plane from falling freely. Also, it is incredibly dangerous to turn off the engines of an airplane while it is flying. The engines must be engaged to force the plane along the path it would follow naturally if there were no atmosphere and thus, no resistive forces. In this section we ll see why this path must be in the shape of a parabola.  Newton very famously said, If I have been able to see further, it is by standing on the shoulders of giants, and, in his paper on Calculus, Leibniz remarked that Other very learned men have sought in many devious ways what someone versed in this calculus can accomplish in these lines as by magic.   As we ve seen Fermat, Descartes, and Roberval were three of the learned giants Newton and Leibniz were indebted to. Another was Professor Galilei (1564-1642) of the University of Pisa, who is universally known and referred to by his first name, Galileo . As a professor of mathematics at Pisa, Galileo studied, among other things, how objects moved under the influence of gravity.  We will be following Galileo s lead to address such questions as:   Suppose you throw a ball straight up into the air. How high will the ball go?    How long will it take for it to hit the ground and what will its velocity be at impact?    If you throw the ball up twice as hard. Will it go twice as high?   Since Galileo had neither the technology nor the mathematics to account for air resistance he ignored it. For the moment we will ignore it too.    We all know from experience that if you throw a ball straight up in the air, it will reach some maximum height. But suppose you throw the ball up twice as hard, would it go twice as high?  We re asking you to guess. Don't worry about being wrong. Just take your best guess.    The accepted theory of motion in Galileo s time was Aristotle s assertion that a heavier object would fall faster than a lighter object. Our common experience is that a hammer falls faster than a feather so this was an entirely reasonable thing to believe at the time. But we now know that this is because the resistance of the air slows the feather more than it does the hammer.  In , Apollo Astronaut David Scott confirmed this experimentally (see the video below) by dropping both a hammer and a feather on the surface of the moon. Because there is no air on the surface of the moon there is no air resistance, so the hammer and feather hit the surface of the moon at the same time.    David Scott dropping a hammer and a feather on the surface of the Moon            Since he didn t have access to the moon Galileo had to be clever instead. But Galileo was one of the group of new scientists who gathered experimental data and applied mathematical principles to theories. As a result of his experimental investigations Galileo proposed that in the absence of air all objects would fall at the same rate   Historical Note  Galileo could be quite argumentative and this eventually got him into hot water with the Vatican. In the last years of his long life he was threatened with excommunication and and risked execution for espousing Copernicus    How did he surmise that all objects would fall at the same rate?  Well actually, he didn t. We need to be very careful in our use of language here. To say that all objects fall at the same rate is a bit sloppy. Since velocity is the rate of change of position it seems to say that all objects fall at the same velocity.  But we know that s not true because the velocity of a falling object depends on how long it has been falling. At the moment you drop a ball its velocity is zero. Thereafter it gains velocity it accelerates. Thus an object that has just been dropped is moving slowly while an object that has been falling for a while is moving at a faster rate.  What Galileo actually proposed was that the rate of change of the velocity the acceleration  of all falling bodies is constant. But an object falling freely under the influence of Earth rsq\/>s gravity gets moving pretty quickly and in Galileo s day the tools available for measurement were very limited. So he slowed things down by letting small balls roll down a ramp as shown below.   Galileo assumed (correctly) that friction with the ramp would not significantly influence his measurements. When he did this he noticed that the balls always seemed to accelerate at a constant rate which depended only on the steepness of the ramp. More precisely, the acceleration of the rolling ball varied with the angle of descent. In modern terms we would say that the acceleration is a function of the angle of descent.   Acceleration on an Incline      Acceleration     4.9    6.93    8.49    9.47    9.72    9.78    9.795    9.799    9.799    Referring to the diagram above, it is clear that when --> the ball won t move at all. So its acceleration is zero. When the ball accelerates downward freely under the influence of gravity with no resistance Galileo measured the acceleration associated with steeper and steeper ramps (that is for closer and closer to zero) obtaining a table of values similar to the one at the left.   Comment  Notice that we are using radians to measure the angle. If you are unsure what a radian is we have a brief review of Trigonometry in .   For scientific computation radian measure is usually simplest, so we will use fairly consistently throughout this text. But degree measure is also common so it will occasionally make an appearance, like it did in .  From the table it is clear that as gets closer and closer to zero the acceleration is getting closer and closer to Thus Galileo deduced that when there is no ramp (when ) the velocity will increase each second by   That is, the velocity of an object falling under the influence of the earth s gravity increases by meters per second, each second. This is usually abbreviated as , is commonly denoted by , and is called the constant of acceleration due to gravity    With a little Trigonometry you can deduce that with only one measurement. Use the diagram and the first line of the table above to deduce that     .   If we drop the object from some height, then its initial velocity is zero. After one second it will be falling at a rate of , after two seconds, its velocity will be , etc. That is, as an object falls, its velocity increases at the constant rate of every second:   The specific number that Galileo found, , is an artifact of the units we use to measure distance (meters) and time (seconds) and the fact that we are on the surface of a particular planet. If we measure distance in feet instead then at the surface of the earth a falling object will accelerate at . If we go to the surface of the moon, it will accelerate at .   Show that if we measure distance in feet, the acceleration constant on the moon is approximately    The general situation is this: If a falling object >s velocity, in meters per second ( ), is changing at a constant rate of meters per second per second ( ), and is the number of elapsed seconds then From Galileo s work we know that at the surface of the Earth so   We can check that this is reasonable by looking at the units of measurement. Since the acceleration is measured in and time is measured in seconds, when they are multiplied a symbolic cancellation gives or meters per second; the units used to measure velocity. Notice that equation is independent of the weight of the falling object. Under the influence of gravity alone all objects accelerate downward at the same rate.  Galileo s hypothesis that all objects falling solely under the influence of Earth s gravity accelerate at the same rate came from both his experimental evidence and a famous thought experiment he described in his book On Motion (1590). The experiment runs as follows:         Imagine that two objects, one light and one heavy, are connected to each other by a string and we drop them from a great height, say the top of the Tower of Pisa. If we assume heavier objects do indeed fall faster than lighter ones the string will soon pull taut as the lighter object retards the fall of the heavier object.  So, the system taken as a whole will fall more slowly than the heavier object alone. But the system as a whole is heavier than either individual object. So, the system taken as a whole will fall faster than the heavier object.  This contradiction leads inexorably to the conclusion that our initial assumption that heavier objects accelerate faster must be false.  According to legend Galileo tested his hypothesis by dropping balls of different weights from the top of the Tower of Pisa, but that is almost certainly pure legend. He never actually did this. Probably.  Galileo set out his ideas about falling objects in his last book Discorsi e Dimostrazioni Matematiche intorno à due nuoue Scienze (Discourses and Mathematical Demonstrations Concerning Two New Sciences) (1638). This was the last of Galileo s many scientific works   Historical Background  Toward the end of his life the Inquisition of the Catholic Church placed Galileo under house arrest in his home. His crime what that he had openly supported Copernicus s theory that the earth revolves around the sun. Rather than remain idle during his imprisonment he revisited his unpublished research from when he was younger and used that as a foundation for his final opus.   The two sciences referred to in the title were the science of motion, which became the foundation of modern physics, and the science of materials and construction, an important contribution to engineering.  Suppose an object falls meters from the top of the Tower of Pisa to the ground. Can we determine how fast it is moving when it strikes the ground?  Recall that the formula tells us the ball s velocity at any time . So if is the amount of time it takes for the ball to reach the ground then the velocity at the end would be . But how do we find out exactly when the ball strikes the ground?  To see the difficulty, suppose we dropped the ball from a height of meters. Would it take second for the ball to hit the ground?  Clearly not.  To reach the ground after second the ball would have to average during the entirety of that first second. But at first it is not moving at all (velocity ). After one second its velocity has increased to . So for the entire duration of that first second the ball s velocity is less than . Thus after second it has not yet hit the ground because it was never going fast enough to do so. Exactly how far it has fallen isn t clear.  Reasoning similarly, at the beginning of the next second the ball is already falling at and thereafter it s velocity increases, so it falls at least meters during the next second, in addition to the distance it fell during the first. So, while we cannot yet tell exactly how far it falls during either second, we can say that, (1) it will not hit the ground during the first second, and (2) it definitely will hit the ground sometime during the next second.  If we had an expression for the ball s position, , similar to ), we would be in much better shape. Galileo was able to determine the distance the ball fell without the tools of Calculus, but since learning to use those tools is why we re here, we will use them.    Bringing in Calculus  Let represent the position at time of a ball under the influence of gravity. That is, tells us how far the ball has moved from its starting position, , after seconds. Our goal is to use Galileo s discovery that to find a formula for .  During an (infinitesimal) instant of time , the velocity is virtually constant so during that instant of time, , the infinitesimal change in position, is given by But from equation we also know that , so .    Thus finding the position of the ball at any time reduces to finding an expression for that satisfies the differential equation    We begin with an educated guess. From the Power Rule the differential of a quadratic expression like will be the linear term , so seems like a reasonable guess.    Show that satisfies equation when     Earlier we reasoned that a ball dropped from a height of meters would strike the ground between one and two seconds after being dropped. Use to find out exactly how long it takes.    How long would it take the ball to hit the ground if dropped from the top of the Tower of Pisa (a height of meters?    Evaluate . What does this represent physically?   Remember that is a change in position and is a change in time.    To summarize the results of we see that if denotes the position of a dropped ball at time , the following statements are true.   The velocity of the ball is given by ,    The rate of change of the velocity (acceleration) is then.      Notice that in our diagram we also introduced the variable which represents the height of the ball from the ground. The way we choose to define our variables can have a considerable impact on the way we understand a given problem. Here for example both and give us the position of the ball but if , then represents the top of the tower and the positive direction is down. Conversely, if , then represents ground level and the positive direction is up.  Our examination of Galileo s work affords us the opportunity to broaden our understanding of the meaning and use of differentials and differential notation. In we used to represent the distance that the ball has fallen at time . In that case it turned out that represents the velocity with which the ball is falling at time . This is at once mundane and profound.  It is mundane because velocity has always been defined as distance ( ) divided by elapsed time ( ), and this remains true even when the distance and the time are infinitesimals.  It is profound because the (instantaneous) velocity , of the ball is always some finite quantity, but we compute it using the quotient of two differentials, in this case.  This differential ratio is a fundamental concept. In general if some quantity, say is changing in time then represents the (instantaneous) rate of change of .  In we saw that the velocity of the falling ball is also changing in time, just like its position. Thus we can turn around and compute the instantaneous change in velocity (the acceleration) by computing the differential of the velocity , and dividing by , giving . This very awkward notation is often abbreviated as . Notice that the acceleration is the result of the following set of computational steps:   Differentiate .    Divide by .    Differentiate .    Divide by again.     As you become more fluent with these computations you will inevitably begin to combine these steps. Your teacher probably already does. However, the computation of a differential ratio always involves finding the differential of some finite quantity and then dividing by another differential. If your instructor computes a differential ratio and you don t see how it was done, ask them to show you each differentiation and division. If we read the abbreviated notation literally it seems to suggest that is meaningful but it is not. The notion of taking the differential of a differential is fraught with logical difficulties which we will address in Chapter . For now we can avoid pitfalls by recognizing that the expression is the result of differentiating and dividing by  times. We will explore this bit further in the next section.    Consider a ball moving vertically so that its height at time seconds is given by     Determine the ball s initial   Position       Velocity   ,    Acceleration      Remember to go through the two step process of differentiating and then dividing by We insist.    Is up the positive or the negative direction?    How high will the ball go?    When will the ball hit the ground?    What is the impact velocity?    Describe in words the physical situation being modeled by the formula ?    In general the height of an object falling near the surface of the earth is given by meters.   Show that the initial height is , the initial velocity is , and the acceleration is .    For simplicity, assume . How high will the ball go?    Suppose we double our initial velocity. Would the ball go twice as high? Compare this to your guess in .       Since the graph of is a parabola it is tempting to conclude that we have shown that an object falling under the influence of gravity alone must be a parabola. But this not correct. We have consistently assumed that the ball is falling vertically so its flight path is a straight vertical line, not a parabola. The graph of is not the flight path of the ball.    The Derivative    Joseph Louis Lagrange {1736-1813}           Differentials are helpful for learning and using the differentiation rules, but otherwise they are not very useful. Moreover as we have frequently pointed out, using differentials brings up certain logical and philosophical questions (Like, What are they? ) that are very difficult to address. When we come back to these matters in Chapter you ll see what we mean. For all of these reasons and more the concept of differentials should be regarded as a convenient fiction and nothing more.  On the other hand as we ve just seen the ratio of differentials, , is extremely useful as it can be used to represent either the slope of a graph or the velocity of a moving object, depending on the context. Moreover the differential ratio is an ordinary real number.  Because of concerns regarding the validity of differentials, mathematicians in the th and th centuries, had a strong motivation to skip over the differential concept and jump immediately to the more useful, and finite, differential ratio.  In his 1797 work Théorie des Fonctions Analytiques ( The Theory of Analytic Functions ), Joseph Louis Lagrange (1736 1813) attempted to make Calculus more rigorous. He even coined a new term for the differential ratio. He called it the fonction d\\ {e riv\\'{e}e} (meaning a function derived from another function). He also replaced the differential ratio with the more modern function notation (read this aloud as prime of ).  Lagrange s attempt to make Calculus rigorous was very clever, but ultimately unsuccessful. Full rigor had to wait for another hundred years, so we will not say much about Lagrange s efforts here. But we will adopt his terminology and his notation.   DIGRESSION: Function Notation, and Prime Notation  Digression Function Notation, and Prime Notation    The French phrase fonction déerivé has come into English as derived function, the derivative function , or (most commonly) just the derivative .  Suppose that . It is clear that depends on , so we denote this functional dependence with the notation   Lagrange called the differential ratio , a derived function . The derived part seems clear enough. After all, if them is obtained (derived) from as follows:   Since depends on as a function it would not be wrong to denote this functional dependence as but it would be awkward. Moreover, Lagrange was trying to get away from the use of differentials so instead he used and called the derivative (derived function) of .  In some contexts Lagrange s prime notation has several advantages over the differential notation we ve been using. Over time it has become the most common notation for the derivative in mathematics. But the fact that it took over years to develop suggests that something more than mere notation is in play here.  Our current task is to master the differentiation rules so we will stick to Leibniz s differential notation as much as possible because using multiple equivalent notations can be very confusing. But there will come a time when Lagrange s prime notation will be much more convenient. At that point we will casually use the two expressions and interchangeably and we will think of them both as a function derived from the function .  When we do this the differential notation we re currently emphasizing will take on two distinct personalities. On the one hand represents a ratio of the differentials , and which are distinct infinitesimal quantities. On the other hand is the name of a function -- it is all one symbol. You cannot detach the pieces of any more than you can delete the letter n from because si has no meaning.  Eventually the differentials we ve been using so casually will become a guilty secret. Given we ll use them as a helpful aid while we compute . But as soon as we have in hand we will view it as a single, complete symbol representing the (finite) derivative function. Often we will simply replace it with as if we are ashamed of having used differentials at all.  This more advanced viewpoint will become commonplace later, but to give you a preview, consider the following problem.     Recall that in Descartes Method of Normals, we had to find a double root of a polynomial. To deal with this problem, Johann van Waveren Hudde (1628 1704) developed an algebraic tool for determining such double roots. Calculus allows a development of Hudde s Rule that does not require the complex algebraic reasoning that Hudde used and is much easier to follow.   Historical Background  Actually Hudde did considerably more than this. His method for finding double roots was a part of what has been called the Lost Calculus of algebraic functions. If you are interested you can read more about this in Jeff Suzuki s award winning article \\ The Lost Calculus (1637 1670): Tangency and Optimization without Limits    Consider any polynomial . Let and be any real numbers and form the following Hudde Polynomial.  Hudde showed that if is a double root of , then is a root of the Hudde polynomial     Show that if is a double root of the polynomial then it is a root of .   If is a double root of , then for some polynomial .    Show that and use this to prove Hudde s Rule.                                         END OF DIGRESSION   The bottom line is that we will adopt the name derivative to indicate the result of dividing one differential by another. So the expression is the derivative of with respect to .   When computing a derivative you will eventually become sufficiently proficient that you will jump directly to the derivatives. But for now we urge you to go through the two-step process of differentiating to obtain a differential and then dividing by another differential to obtain a derivative because the computational rules you ve learned are differentiation rules, not derivative rules. If you do this, you will avoid some difficulties created by trying compute too much too soon. This can be illustrated in the following example, where we purposely use prime notation to highlight the difficulties involved in the computation.   Given we wish to compute . Setting we see that By the Power Rule we have This would seem to be correct but it is not. Do you see the problem?  The left side of equation ) indicates that the variable is but there is no on the right side, only . So this can t be right. But what went wrong? We can avoid problems like this by using differentials: At this point if we divide by we recover equation in the form: Thus we see the left side of equation ) should have been not .    Starting with equation ) complete the computation of .    Of course, using differentials does not address all of the difficulties. For example, let . Then So far, so good. Next we apply the Product Rule, so    Historical Background  To see why we need to know that Leibniz always considered the differential to be a constant. And the differential of any constant is zero, by the Constant Rule.   The glaring question here is why is equal to zero in equation but is not equal to zero in equation ? Or, at a more fundamental level, what do we mean by the infinitely small change of an infinitely small change? As we will see in Chapter the early critics of Calculus cited this question specifically to argue that Calculus was invalid.  We will address these issues beginning in Chapter . For now we will make the following compromise: We will only differentiate finite quantities, be they functions, or derivatives. Since our ultimate goal is to compute some derivative this will suit our needs without getting caught up in the very problematic question of the nature of higher order differentials. So for this example we have     Consider the expression . Differentiating we have You ve probably been taught all of your life to simplify complex looking expressions like and you probably do it without thinking. So you may be wondering why we left the coefficients above in the form we did.  The reason is simple. We were looking for patterns not numbers. Writing the above formulas as  , and obscures the pattern. Keep this in mind as you proceed. Algebraic or arithmetical simplifications often get in the way of recognizing patterns. Don t do them until there is a compelling reason to.   Find the Pattern  Find the pattern in . Use this pattern to find directly, without computing all fifty derivatives.    Consider the circle . Differentiating, we have , or . Differentiating again we have          Continue this example to show that .    Solve for and use this to compute .    Do you get the same answer? Which method do you prefer?    For each of the following find in terms of and :              Compare this with part (b).     Compare this with . Which method do you prefer?            Problem We know that it is not generally true that even though there are certain exceptions, like , and , or . In the same way, even though the Product Rule makes it very clear that there are certain pairs of functions which are exceptions; for which  is true. For example, show that for each of the following it is true that .                            Find the general pattern in part (a).    Those pairs of functions which fit the pattern you found in part (b) are not the only exceptional pairs. Can you find others?    Adopting Lagrange s terminology, but not his notation, we see that if the position of a point moving in a straight line (like the axis) is given by , then the first derivative, , will give its velocity, and its second derivative, , will give its acceleration.  Each of the following represents the position of a point on the -axis at time . Find the velocity and acceleration.                                   For each of the following represents the position of a point moving along the -axis. Use the information given to determine if the point is slowing down or speeding up at the instant .                          Thinking Dynamically  If represents the position of an object moving in a straight line we have seen that its velocity is given by . When the object is falling vertically we will use to represent its vertical position, so that is its vertical velocity. Similarly if it is moving horizontally we will use and .        Recall that in Problem we imagined releasing an object from a helicopter which is flying horizontally horizontally with a speed of . From Galileo s work we now know that its vertical velocity will be .  After its release the ball will fall neither horizontally, nor vertically. It won t even fall along a straight line. If we ignore air resistance then combination of the ball s horizontal velocity (inherited from the helicopter) and its vertical velocity (due to the force of gravity) will cause the flight path, , to curve into an arc similar to that shown in the figure below.    Since we have . Since and we know that Use this to find a formula for and confirm that the arc is a parabola.        We d like to find the speed of the object in the direction it is moving. Referring to the differential triangle in our sketch it is clear that this will be . But how do we find ?   Mathematical Notation  The absolute value bars here are correct. This has more to do with our vocabulary (speed vs. velocity) than with this physical problem. In general speed is always a positive number, while velocity can be negative or positive. We will discuss this in more depth in    Since and are perpendicular (they are displacements in the horizontal and vertical directions, respectively) by the Pythagorean Theorem we have Thus the displacement of , in the direction of travel is Dividing by we see that the speed in the direction of travel at any time is   Recall that we stopped analyzing in Problem because we needed to be able to account for both the velocity and the acceleration of the craft. We now have everything we need to finish the analysis of the flight path of the commercial airliner which we started in .           Recall that in we asked you find the equation of this flight path from the data in the figure at the right. You should have found that As we said when we suspended our earlier efforts, the problem with this picture is that it is static. It is a picture of the path the airliner has flown after the flight is finished. We now have the tools we need to address the characteristics of the flight as it occurs.    Use the differential triangle in our figure to show that airspeed of the airplane in its direction of motion, , its horizontal velocity, , and slope of its flight path, , are related by the formula:    Recall that , and are the horizontal and vertical velocities respectively    Assume that the plane s horizontal velocity is constant.   Use equation to explain how we know that the plane is traveling fastest when it is at the point where the curve is steepest (about where the red dot is in our sketch\\aside{It is possible to find the numerical coordinates of this point but it is rather difficult to see how to proceed at this point. It is worth taking a few minutes to ponder how this might be done.}).    What is the slowest speed attained by the plane, and where on the flight path does this occcur?       Suppose are the coordinates of a ball moving along the given curves. If the ball is moving with a constant horizontal velocity of for each curve find the following.    The vertical velocity of the ball at the points indicated.    The horizontal and vertical acceleration of the ball at the points indicated.    The speed in the direction of travel of the ball at the points indicated.   Curve 1:   at and     Curve 2:   at and     Curve 3:   at and         The next problem will complete our analysis of the flight path of our commercial airliner.    The flight path obtained was . We need to put some limitations on the vertical acceleration, , experienced by the passengers in a commercial airliner. For simplicity assume that the pilot must maintain a constant horizontal speed of . (That is, set .)    Use the above equation to show that the vertical acceleration is given by     On the interval , what is the largest vertical acceleration and what is the smallest vertical acceleration and where do they occur? Does this make sense physically?    Suppose we put a restriction on the vertical acceleration so that for some constant . Show that with this restriction, .    Suppose that initially meters, , (which is approximately of the acceleration due to gravity). Find what must be (in kilometers).%      Newton s Method of Fluxions    The method of Fluxions is the general key by help whereof the modern mathematicians unlock the secrets of Geometry, and consequently of Nature.   George Berkeley, from The Analyst (1685-1753)    Through experimentation Galileo had accurately described the motion of objects falling near the surface of the earth. At about the same time Johannes Kepler (1571 1630) had accurately described the motion of the planets by analyzing the vast catalog of astronomical observation made by Tycho Brahe (1546 1601). But these two descriptions of motion did not appear to be related.   It was left to Newton to unify them, but the mathematics for this did not exist at the time. So he invented Calculus, which he called The Method of Fluxions     Galileo studied motion on the surface of the Earth. Kepler studied the motion of the planets, but the underlying theme for both was motion.        For Newton everything was in motion. When he used the variable he thought of it as representing something flowing in time (moving). Such quantities he called fluents , from fluere , the Latin word which means to flow. As he put it himself in his book Quadratura Curvarum ( On the Quadrature of Curves ),   I sought a method of determining quantities from the velocities of the motions or [of the] increments, with which they are generated; and calling these velocities of the motions, or [of the] increments, fluxions , and generated quantities fluents , I fell by degrees, in the years and , upon the method of fluxions, which I have made use of here in the quadrature of curves.   For a given fluent , Newton used the dotted letter,  , to refer to its instantaneous velocity or fluxion . Whereas for Leibniz the static differential was the fundamental concept, for Newton the dynamic fluxion (velocity) was fundamental. On the surface fluxions seem quite different from differentials.  In Newton s view the only independent variable is time. So all fluxions were velocities, or rates of change with respect to time. To see how fluxions are connected to the differential ratios we ve been using, we need only ask ourselves how Leibniz would express the fluxion, , of the fluent, . In Leibniz notation the rate of change of  with respect to  is the differential ratio . Since Newton defines  to be the rate of change of with respect to ( )ime (velocity),   From Newton s point of view differentiating the spatial coordinate with respect to the spatial coordinate to get is simply not meaningful. On the other hand, if is a point moving along some curve in the plane then both and are fluents with corresponding fluxions and .  What Leibniz s notation expresses as Newton s notation expresses as . But they are the same thing. since   Although the two formulations are equivalent Leibniz notation has become dominant in mathematics. But in fields where velocity is a fundamental concept, like physics and engineering, Newton s dot notation is often still used. For example, suppose we are considering a point on the curve and we want the slope of the curve at . Using our differentiation rules, we have To get the slope, we divide by to get   Using his Method of Fluxions, Newton would have considered both and to be fluents and to be a point moving along a curve. His version of Calculus would have started with the same governing equation and determined that their fluxions were related by the equation   To get the slope of the curve , we simply need to recognize that this is the same as   Although Newton s dot notation has fallen out of favor in mathematics you will likely see it being used in your physics or engineering courses.      For the Folium of Descartes:    Show that .    Locate all of the points where the line tangent to the Folium of Descartes is horizontal.    Locate all of the points where the line tangent to the Folium of Descartes is vertical.         The Tschirnhausen cubic:    Show that     Locate all of the points where the line tangent to the Tschirnhausen cubic is horizontal.    Locate all of the points where the line tangent to the Tschirnhausen cubic is vertical.       If we try to compute for the Folium of Descartes we find that which is very strange. We can see in the graph that at there is both a horizontal and a vertical tangent line, so it seems to make some sort of sense.  You might be thinking that we have stumbled upon a new rule about tangent lines: If we ever obtain , at some point then the curve has both a vertical and horizontal tangent at that point. It would be nice if things were that simple, but they aren t.  But now consider the Tschirnhausen Cubic at the self-intersection point . As long as we stay away from the self-intersection point there are no difficulties. But from the graph we can see that any sort of tangent line at the point of self-intersection would be neither vertical nor horizontal despite the fact that once again we have   If nothing else, these examples illustrate that using Calculus is much more subtle than simply computing a derivative. A cavalier attitude can lead to some very strange anomalies. As is true of any powerful tool, to avoid disaster we must be careful.  The safest approach is to avoid points of self-intersection and fractions such as . But we won t be able to avoid them forever so we might as well address the issue now. Adopting Newton s dynamic approach will give us the crucial insight. Think of the horizontal and vertical coordinates as Newton s fluents; things changing in time.  Using the static approach to find a tangent line at a self-intersection point is very much like standing in the center of the intersection of two roads and trying to decide if the road goes north-south or east-west. Obviously the road doesn t go anywhere. It just sits there. Likewise, a curve is not dynamic. It just sits there, like a road.  It is the travelers on the road and the point that traces a curve which move.  If instead we ask, Which way are we going as we pass through the intersection ? there is only one answer. We re going in the direction we were traveling when we entered the intersection. If we think about the situation dynamically rather than statically, we always have both a position on the curve and a direction we are traveling.  So if we adopt Newton s viewpoint and think of the curve as being generated by the motion of a point things change.  If we are traveling along a curve our direction of travel is always tangent to the curve. By changing our question from What is the tangent line at this point? to What is the tangent line at this time? the concept of two (or more) tangent lines at a single point in space becomes meaningful. Each tangent is obtained by passing through the point of tangency at distinct moments in time.        Show that if and satisfy then and satisfy the equation of the Tschirnhausen Cubic: .    Compute the fluxions of and .    If we think of as time, with , representing time in the past, will the point traverse the clockwise or counterclockwise as increases?   Consider the values of for which and are moving in the positive and negative directions.    Find the values of for which . Use the result of part (b) to compute at these times. Are your answers consistent with what you obtained in part (c)? Explain.    Show that the equations of the two lines which are tangent to the Tschirnhausen cubic at are                                     Recall that the Folium of Descartes, , crosses itself at the origin.    Show that if and then and satisfy the equation of the Folium.    Compute the fluxions of and .    For which values of is ?    Find the value of for which . use the result of part (b) to compute at this time. Is this consistent with the graph?    Can you explain why we only found one tangent line at when it is quite clear from the graph that there must be two?                     What comes along with this change in interpretation is this: We no longer want to think of a differential ratio only as a slope. If and happen to represent the vertical and horizontal coordinates of a graph, then the change of with respect to , , will be the slope of the curve .  If represents the vertical position of an object and represents the time when the object is at position , then the change of with respect to , , is the vertical velocity of the object as it passes through . Likewise, if represents the horizontal position of an object then is the horizontal velocity of the object as it passes through .  In general, if and are two related quantities then is the rate of change of with respect to . The physical (or geometric) interpretation of will necessarily depend on what and represent physically (or geometrically).    Parametric Functions  When we switched to Newton s dynamical viewpoint, we changed the nature of our representations of the curves. For example the Folium of Descartes can be represented by the formula as This formula is complex and can be hard to work with, mainly because the relationship between and is difficult to see and understand.  In the representation the relationship between and is still difficult but since and are both functions the relationship between and and between and is a bit simpler. We know how to work with functions.  This second representation is usually called the parametric functions or parametric equation representation, because the and coordinates are given in terms of a parameter. In this case the parameter represents time. This is common but by no means required. The parameter might represent anything, just as any variable might.  In fact, you might be wondering where we got the parameterization for the Folium. It may not seem obvious, but as long as , the parameter actually represents the slope of the line joining the origin to the point on the Folium.    Let represent any point on the Folium which is not the origin. Let represent the slope of the line joining the origin to ; that is, or . Use this to show that   The difference between this problem and is this: In Problem we gave you and and asked you to show that it satisfies the equation of the Folium. Here we start with the equation of the Folium and you need to find and .    Of course, it is not wrong to also think of this parameter as time. We are just stipulating that the point is moving so that its position at time is such that the slope of the line joining the origin to the point matches . Mathematically, what the parameter represents is usually not at issue. It is just a parameter.  Recall that when we looked at Roberval s treatment of the conic sections in Section we found it handy to think of our curves as being traced out by the motion of a point and we created the notation to reflect that point of view. With one slight modification this notation suits our current needs as well.  First, since the coordinates of our point are, individually, functions of it follows that the position of the point itself depends on (is a function of) as well:   Second, it is useful for us to have a convenient way to specify the domain of the function. So we add a third component to do that. For example, if the domain of our function is all values of strictly between zero and one we would write.    Dynamic and static are only words we use to describe the way we re thinking about a problem. There is nothing inherently dynamic or static in either representation so there is no a priori reason to prefer one over the other. They describe the same set of points in the plane.  For example if then . Time ( ) does not appear in these formulas so we tend to think of them statically. However if we want to think of them dynamically we divide by to get and interpret this to say that at any given time , the position of a point is and the vertical velocity, is twice the value of the coordinate times the horizontal velocity, .        Use your favorite graphing technology to show that the parameterization traces out part of the parabola . Which part?    The parameterization traces out different part of the same parabola. How else is this parameterization different from the one in part (a)?    Explain why neither of these parameterizations traces the part of the curve where .                              Moving between the equation and parametric forms can be very hard to do depending on the complexity of the equation. The simplest situation is when you have as a function of ; for example . To find a parametric representation we observe that we need to specify both and as functions of a third parameter, . This can be puzzling until we realize that is completely free. All we need to do is ensure that . So if we take and we almost have our parameterization.  When faced with a formula like you have learned to always assume that could be any real number that makes sense in the formula. But with parametric equations this assumption can lead to problems. We ll need to specify the allowable values of the parameter explicitly. This is why we said we almost have our parameterization. A complete parameterization must specify the values of that are available to us, so in this case   We can always parameterize the graph of a function the same way we just parameterized . A parameterization of , with domain is   This parameterization is equivalent to working with the function so it may or may not be particularly useful, but it can always be done.         Use your favorite graphing technology to show that each of the following is a parameterization of part of the graph of .                                              Sketch only the part of the curve included in each parameterization in part (a). Be sure to indicate the direction of travel in each case, assuming is increasing.    Compute and show that this yields for each of the parameterizations in part (a).                                                                           Show that each of the following is a parameterization of part of the unit circle.                                    Sketch only the part of the curve included in each parameterization in part (a). Be sure to indicate the direction of travel in each case.    Compute and show that this yields for each of the parameterizations in part (a).                                                               As we ve seen we can always parameterize the graph of a function, but the reverse is not true. A parameterized curve will not always be the graph of some function. For example the curves in are not graphs of functions, but all of these curves can be parameterized.  Because it can t always be accomplished there is no general strategy for expressing a parameterized curve as the graph of a function. One strategy that sometimes works is to find and undifferentiate as in the following example.   Comment  Not necessarily the best. In general there is no best way.            The red curve in the sketch at the right is parameterized by Differentiating and gives and so that .    Fill in the details of the computation of , , and show that .    Let and show that .    Sketch the graph of to see that this is not the same as the parameterized curve above. Can you tell what went wrong?    Show that the point is on our parameterized curve. Use this to find the function, , that has the same graph as .                                                For each of the given parameterizations find two different ways:   Compute and and find their ratio, .    Solve for in terms of (or ), substitute the result into (or ), and then compute directly.   And then find .                                                          Bridges, Chains, Domes, and Telescopes   Bridges  In the previous section all of the quantities we were looking at were time dependent they were in motion so it was useful to think of the derivative, , as a velocity (fluxion). In other applications, where the quantities involved are not time dependent, the derivative is still a useful tool but thinking of it as a velocity may not be as useful.  For example, consider the shape of the support cable on a stable suspension bridge as seen in the picture below. The shape of the suspension cable appears to be parabolic, but how can we be sure of this?    At any given moment there are a lot of forces acting on a bridge, but most are insignificant most of the time. The mantra of mathematical modeling is to keep things as simple as possible (at least in the beginning) by focusing on the dominant parameter first.   Comment  Equivalently, we set the secondary parameters equal to zero. In this case the dominant force involved is clearly the weight of the bridge itself.   We assume that the weight density of the deck of the bridge is newtons per meter. (A newton is a unit of force named, obviously, after Isaac Newton. ) The cable adds to the weight of the bridge as well, but it is relatively small compared to the weight of the deck. So we will ignore it to keep the model simple. Assuming the deck is horizontal, we can take it to be the axis  Now suppose the graph of represents the cable between two upright towers located at and Remember, though we suspect that is a parabola we don t yet know if this is true.    We choose an arbitrary point on the curve with and focus on the portion of the bridge between and .    These are the two points that are holding up the section of the bridge on the interval from to . The arrows represent the tangential forces felt on the cable at the points.  We ll examine the the horizontal and vertical components of the tangential force at various points on the bridge.    Since the curve is symmetric, we only draw the half where .  Notice the tangential force at , which we have labeled , is horizontal. This reflects the fact that at that point the vertical force would be the weight for the deck from to which is zero (You’ll see why we used negatives momentarily.) Hence the tangential force is equal to the horizontal tension, .        As we move away from the center of the cable to some point , there is more of the deck to support. Since we are ignoring the weight of the cable, the vertical force is equal to the weight of the deck from to so the tangential tension gets larger as we move to the right. The horizontal tension at every single point will be the same as the tension at the origin. What varies is the vertical component of the force.  The cumulative effect can also be thought of this way. The point on the cable at meters must not only support the weight of the deck from meters to meters, but must bear the brunt of the load at the point meters as well. This leads to the vertical force at meters being newtons. The point at meters must support whatever weight there is at meters along with the extra weight from meters to meters which totals newtons. If you were hoisting a person carrying a bucket of sand, then you would be bearing the weight of both the person and the sand even though that person is only bearing the weight of the sand. This is the same idea.         The conclusion of this analysis is that at any point on the curve, the tangential force pulling against the cable has a horizontal component of and a vertical component of . To stabilize the bridge, we need the cable to be pulling with the same force in exactly the opposite direction. This leads to the sketch at the right. (Now you see why we used negatives before.)        Use the above analysis and schematic drawing of the forces involved to show that the curve representing the cable must satisfy the differential equation    Notice that is pulling in the direction tangent to the cable.    Show that the parabola where is an arbitrary constant, satisfies this differential equation    Let , and plot the parabola for . Does this agree with the idea that indicates how tightly we are winching the cable?                   With our simplifying assumptions in place it appears that the cable on a suspension bridge does indeed hang in the shape of a parabola. But the suspension bridge has to hold up the deck beneath it. After all, that is its purpose.    Chains  What shape do you think a chain takes on if it is pinned at both ends, and allowed to hang freely in between? Take your best guess and don’t worry about guessing correctly. We ll solve this problem shortly.  If you guessed that the curve is a parabola, then you are in good company. Galileo also believed that a hanging chain assumed a parabolic shape as we see in the following passage from his book Dialogue Concerning Two New Sciences ( ).            Drive two nails into a wall at a convenient height and at the same level; make the distance between these nails twice the width of the rectangle upon which it is desired to trace the semiparabola. Over these two nails hang a light chain of such length that the depth of its sag (curve or sacca ) is equal to the length of the prism. This chain will assume the form of a parabola, so that if this form be marked by points on the wall we shall have described a complete parabola which can be divided into two equal parts by drawing a vertical line through a point midway between the two nails . . . Any ordinary mechanic will know how to do it.     The Hanging Chain          This problem is very similar to finding the shape of the suspension bridge cable. The difference here is that since there is no deck to support, the only vertical force will be the weight of the chain itself, so we can t ignore the weight of the chain the way we ignored the weight of the cable in the suspension bridge.  Let represent the weight density of the chain in newtons per meter and represent the length of the chain from the lowest point to a point on the chain. Show that the curve represented by the chain must satisfy the differential equation     OK, but so what? All equation ) says is that the proportion is equal to the proportion .  If we could solve this equation for then the graph of would be the shape of the chain, but sadly we don t have the tools to do that (yet).  So why did we bother writing down equation ) at all? Does this tell us anything about the shape of the hanging chain?  Yes. Actually it does.  The fact is that in our attempts to describe the world around us using mathematics we can t actually solve most of the equations we write down. Real world phenomena are just too complex. But just writing them down is a step forward. Although we can t (yet) solve equation ), and thereby find the shape of a hanging chain, we can use it to eliminate some shapes. In particular, we can now show that Galileo was wrong about the shape of a hanging chain.    The difficulty is that we have the wrong variable on the right side of . Since depends on we d like to have only the variables and , appearing in our equation. Instead we have , , and . And we really don t know anything about . However, recall that we do know something about .    Use a differential triangle to show that the hanging chain curve must satisfy the differential equation    Recall the represents a differential along the direction of the curve. How is it related to and ?    Show that the general parabola does \\emph{not} satisfy this differential equation (and so Galileo was mistaken!) .    Show that, in fact no nonzero polynomial satisfies equation .   Suppose it did satisfy the equation. If we were to square both sides of the equation, what would be the degree of each side?                              Galileo s brilliance is not at all diminished by this error. As we said in Chapter , smart people make mistakes! This is how they get to be smart. You should follow the example of Galileo (and Newton, and Leibniz) by making and embracing lots of mistakes. But don t forget to learn from them as well. Also, in fairness to Galileo, he did not have access to the Calculus tools that make this problem tractable. We do.    Domes  In we saw that the shape of a hanging chain is not a parabola as Galileo believed. But it actually shows much more than that. It shows that the shape of a hanging chain is not the graph of any polynomial regardless of its degree. (A parabola is the graph of a polynomial of degree .) This result tell us that the set of polynomials is too small to model all of the phenomena we observe in the world. The solution of the hanging chain problem will require a larger class of functions.  The curve which does satisfy equation ), and thus is the shape of a hanging chain is called the catenary. This is not especially illuminating since the word catenary is derived from the Latin word {\\it catena} which simply means chain.     Drawings of the Pantheon and a cross section of the dome with an inverted catenary superimposed on the arch.       The structural properties of the catenary have been known and used since ancient times The Pantheon in Rome was completed during the reign of Hadrian and dedicated around AD. It is not known who designed it, but there is evidence which suggests that a catenary design was employed.   Comment  For example, its shape.   The architect Filippo Brunelleschi (1377 1446) used a hanging chain to develop the shape of the dome of the Cathedral of Santa Maria del Fiore in Florence, Italy in the Middle Ages.  A number of modern architects and masons have used the catenary to design arches and domes (a rotated arch) as well. For example, the mathematician and architect Sir Christopher Wren (1632 1723) used the shape of the catenary arch in the design and construction of the structural part of the dome on St Paul s Cathedral in London.                 Wren was assisted in designing St. by his good friend Robert Hooke (1635 1703), who advised him that the cross section of the dome should be an inverted catenary: As hangs a flexible cable so, inverted, stand the touching pieces of an arch.   Hooke is also famous for showing that the contracting force of a stretched spring is proportional to the amount of stretching. This is known as Hooke s Law. We will examine this in more depth in .                                                                                                                      Telescopes  Though he didn t invent the telescope, Galileo is usually cited as the first person to use a telescope to discover, for example, craters and mountains on the surface of the Moon, the phases Venus, and the moons of Jupiter. This work helped convince Galileo of the validity of Nicolaus Copernicus heliocentric (sun-centered) model of the solar system, for which he (Galileo) was eventually condemned by the Inquisition. The Englilshman Thomas Harriot did it before Galileo but Harriot didn t publish his observations.            All telescopes follow one of two basic designs, refractive and reflective. Refractive telescopes us the refractive property of light described by Snell s Law (see Section ) to reduce the large image entering the telescope to a smaller area, thus focusing the image for the observer. Galileo used a refractive telescope  Refractive telescopes work well for relatively close objects, but since refraction separates light into its various color components (think of light passing through a prism) it tends to create little rainbows (usually called chromatic aberrations) in the image.    The Large Binocular Telescope, Mt. Graham, Arizona            Because of his work in optics, Newton realized that he could use the reflective properties of the parabola to achieve greater magnification with a smaller physical device while simultaneously avoiding the chromatic aberrations. All modern research telescopes are built on Newton s original design, which uses parabolic mirrors to reflect light toward the focus of the parabola, where a secondary mirror reflects it to the eyepiece.  For example the each mirror of the two large mirrors required by the Large Binocular Telescope at Mt. Graham, Arizona is meters in diameter. The image below gives a sense of the size of one of these mirrors.    To produce a large, perfectly parabolic mirror the Richard F. Caris Mirror Laboratory uses a process called spin casting, where high quality borosilicate glass is place into a revolving furnace. As the furnace spins the glass liquefies and the rotational forces push the surface of the glass into a parabolic shape.  As the molten glass spins the middle goes down and the sides go up. As we will see momentarily the surface generated must be a parabola. The shape of the mirror, and hence its focal length, will be affected by the rotational speed of the glass. The question is, how fast must we spin the furnace to produce a particular focal length?  To begin to answer that question we will need to think about a typical point mass at a point on the surface of the molten glass as shown below. Suppose the glass is spinning at an angular velocity of . Our task is to find the function whose graph is shape of a cross-section of the surface of the liquid glass.    The red arrow in the diagram depicts the force keeping the point mass elevated and spinning in a circle. It will be perpendicular to the surface of the liquid, as shown. (Think about a hose with a hole in it. The water sprays out in a stream perpendicular to the hose.)  If we separate that force into its vertical and horizontal components, as shown in the diagram, the magnitude of the vertical component of the force is , where is the acceleration due to gravity. This is the force needed to counter the weight of the particle.    The only horizontal force is the centripetal force due to the spinning of the furnace, which is . We will derive this formula analytically in when we have extended the scope of our differentiation rules. For now assume this is correct and proceed.    Use the diagram above to show that the curve must satisfy the differential equation    The slope of the line tangent to the parabola at will be . This will be perpendicular to the force acting at that point, represented by the red arrow.    Show that must be a parabola to satisfy this differential equation.    Using the value , graph the parabola from part (b). for . Do these graphs coincide with your intuition about what should happen as the liquid rotates faster?                         In antiquity the reflective properties of all of the conic sections (parabola, ellipse and hyperbola) were worked out via very laborious geometric arguments. In Chapter we saw that Roberval reestablished these properties using his more dynamic (if somewhat questionable) approach. The next two problems will reestablish the reflective property of the parabola once more using a combination of Geometry and Calculus.  Recall from Chapter that any light ray parallel to the axis of a parabola will reflect to a single point (the focus of the parabola).           A parabola may be defined geometrically as the set of points equidistant from a given point, the focus, and a given line, the directrix as shown below. Suppose that the point lies on the parabola with focus and directrix as in the diagram at the right.    Show that must satisfy the equation:     In , show that in order to spin a mirror with a focus Having the correct focus (and thus the correct focal length) is of paramount importance in the performance of the telescope. To give you a notion of the precision required, it took months to polish the surface of one of the primary mirrors in the Large Binocular Telescope to a precision of nanometers ( times thinner than a human hair). at the angular velocity must be .                                        Consider the parabola with equation focus , and directrix as in .    Show that the tangent line (in red) is perpendicular to line segment .    Show that .

We said that we would be able to show that this is the correct formula for the centripetal force once we had extended the scope of our differentiation rules. Extending our differentiation rules to include the trigonometric rules, which we will do next, will enable us to explain where formula came from.  According to Newton, Force = mass acceleration , so to verify the centripetal force formula the task is to show that centripetal acceleration is given by . We will finally do this in but first, we ll need to be able to differentiate both the sine and the cosine functions. In fact, since acceleration is the second derivative of position, we will need the second derivatives of both. Once the derivatives of the sine and cosine are known, computing the derivatives of the other four trigonometric functions is straightforward.  But before we begin we will remind you of some useful facts from Trigonometry.    A Trigonometric Interlude   Radian Measure            You are probably accustomed to measuring angles in degrees. We hope to convince you that radian measure actually is much more natural. It doesn t feel natural to you at first simply because it is new and unfamiliar.  Suppose two children ride on a merry-go-round through an angle , one child is meters from the center, the other is meters from the center. However we choose to measure the angle , it is pretty clear that the child who is meters away from the center will travel farther than the child who is meters away from the center, even though both of their paths have swept out the same angle, .   This tells us is that the distance traveled for a fixed angle along a circle will be proportional to the radius of the circle. To find the actual distance traveled is harder as the following drill shows.   Now suppose . Use the sketch above to show that the first child travels slightly less than meters along the red circle while the second travels slightly less than meters along the blue circle.  (Why do you suppose we chose rather than something more familiar like or ? It seems an odd choice, doesn t it?)   If we travel around a circle, what fraction of the circumference of the circle have we traversed?    was not particularly hard, but it was complicated by the use of degree measure. Radian measure removes that complication.  If on a circle with radius meters, like the red circle in the figure above, we trace out a circular arc equal to the length of its radius we say that the arc-length is meters. If we trace out a distance equal to the length of its radius on the blue circle then this is an arc-length of meters.  But notice that the same central angle subtends both of these arcs. We defince the measure of this angle to be one radian because it is the angle associated with a single radius. An angle of two radians is thus the angle subtended when we measure out an arc length two times the radius of the circle.  In general we have the following result:   More succinctly, if we let represent the arclength and measure in radians we have   In Drill , if we had measured in radians rather than degrees, the computations for each of the arclengths would be (when ) and, (when ). We chose an angle of because is slightly less than an angle of one radian. So we know that the first child traveled slightly less than the radius, meters. Similarly the second child traveled slightly less than meters.  Rather than constantly translating between degrees and radians it will be simplest if you learn to think in radians directly. You should start trying to do that immediately. But breaking old habits is difficult so we need to see how to convert between them. Fortunately this is not hard.  Since the circumference of a circle is , one full transit around the circle subtends an angle of radians. In degrees, a full circle is , so we have   This leads to the conversion, and the identities: Thus, as we mentioned earlier, .  You may find it simpler to just remember that radians is one full rotation around a circle, so radians (a straight angle) is halfway around a circle, and a right angle is half of that, ( radians). Three quarters of the way around a circle would thus be radians, etc.  Use whatever works for you but do start thinking in radians rather than degrees as quickly as you can. It will make what s coming up easier for you.  We adopt the custom that positive angles are counterclockwise and negative angles are clockwise.  For each angle, determine the number of revolutions and direction around the circle. Do not convert to degrees first.    radians     radians     radians             Find the radian measure of each angle described. Do not convert to degrees first.    of a circle in the positive direction.     of a circle in the negative direction.    Twice around the circle in the positive direction.     times around the circle in the negative direction.     times around the circle where can be any real number.                            So far in this chapter we ve only considered static angles. If an object is moving in a circle as in the sketch then the rate of change of the central angle is called the angular velocity .  Angular velocity is , the rate of change of the central angle, with respect to time. Of course the object still has both a vertical velocity, and a horizontal velocity, .  In the diagram below the angular velocity, measures how fast our object is revolving about the point in the positive (counterclockwise) direction. The sign of angular velocity indicates its direction: Positive means counterclockwise and negative means clockwise. The absolute value of the angular velocity, , is the angular speed .   As we saw in Section the velocity in the direction of motion is denoted, where the length of is the (infinitesimal) hypotenuse of the differential triangle in our diagram. Thus denotes the linear velocity of the object. Because is tangent to the path of the object, is also called the tangential velocity .  The direction of the linear velocity is the direction the object is moving as it passes through the point , but notice that the direction cannot be specified with a plus or a minus because the object can travel in more than two directions. During a single circumnavigation the object is traveling in a different direction at every point in its path.  We will continue to use the symbol to denote the tangential velocity. But be aware that this a rather clumsy notation because it doesn t provide a simple way to indicate the direction of travel. This deficiency in our notation will eventually need to be addressed. For now we will be primarily be interested in the linear (tangential) speed : .  The tangential speed tells us how fast the object would move in a straight line if the force holding it in a circular path were suddenly released -- think of an object swinging on a string if the string breaks.  Conversion from angular velocity to linear speed is essentially a change of units, but we need to remember that velocity has direction and speed does not. So we must first convert angular velocity to angular speed by taking its absolute value. In our diagram above the angular velocity of the point about the point is . We compute the linear speed of as follows:           In the computation above the absolute value was superfluous since the angular velocity was positive. However if the object were traveling clockwise it would have been essential to take the absolute value first because a negative speed is meaningless.   Terminology  In ordinary speech the words speed and velocity are often used interchangeably, which can make the distinction we are stressing here difficult to absorb. The distinction is this: Velocity has a magnitude and a direction. The magnitude of velocity is speed.   Suppose a point is revolving in a circle with angular velocity . For each situation find the linear speed of the point in the units indicated.   Find the linear speed of in if meters and .    Find the linear speed of in if centimeters and .    Find the linear speed of in if feet and .  Notice that the units are mixed in this problem.    Find the linear speed of in mph (miles per hour) if miles and .  (This problem describes a physical phenomenon you see daily. Can you identify it?)    Find the linear speed of in mph if miles and .  (This problem describes a physical phenomenon you see monthly. Can you identify it?)    Find the linear speed of in mph if miles and one revolution is completed every days, hours, minutes, and seconds.  (Can you identify the physical phenomenon this problem represents?)    Our sun appears to revolve around the earth once per day. If that were actually happening, what would the sun s linear speed need to be in miles per second? Assume that the distance from the sun to the earth is million miles.                                        The Trigonometric Functions   You are probably most familiar with right triangle Trigonometry, where the functions are defined in terms of the sides of a triangle. This is the simplest way to introduce these functions but historically Trigonometry emerged from the geometry of a circle. Ancient astronomers found it useful to have a Table of Chords to refer to. A chord is the line segment that cuts off part of a circle.     The name of the sine function has a colorful history. In The Words of Mathematics, Steven Schwartzman explains:   In dealing with spherical trigonometry used to study astronomy, Hindu mathematicians determined that it was often convenient to deal with half-chords. The Hindu mathematician Aryabhata ( A.D.) frequently used the abbreviation jya for the word jya-ardha (half chord). This was phonetically translated into jiba by subsequent Arabic mathematicians. Since Arabic is written without vowels then this was written as jb . When Arabic works were translated into Latin, jb posed a problem as there is no such word as jiba in Arabic (recall it was translated phonetically). The closest real Arabic word is jaib which means cove or bay. The Latin word for this is sinus which becomes our modern sine.             In the sketch below we see that is the length of the half chord.   Because the two acute angles, and , in a right triangle in the figure below are complementary (they add up to or ) we see that the term cosine actually makes sense. It is an abbreviation for complement s sine.                   Etymology also helps to explain where the names of the other trigonometric functions came from. When the sine, tangent, and secant functions can be represented as the length of a particular line segment and their names are descriptive of these segments. Let be an angle in standard position (with its vertex at the origin and its initial side along the -axis). On the positive -axis mark off the line segment that is unit long. On the terminal side of the angle, mark off the line segment so that the line segment is tangent to the unit circle. Then the length of the tangent line segment is , while the length of the other line segment is . All of this is depicted in the sketch below As we ve already seen the word tangent comes from the Latin tangere meaning to touch. Similarly the word secant comes from the Latin secare meaning to cut.         The co prefix in front of the other trig functions is an abbreviation of the the word complement . The six trigonometric functions are thus the sine ( ), cosine ( ), tangent ( ), cotangent ( ), secant ( ), and cosecant ( ).          In the diagram above arc is the unit quarter-circle in the first quadrant.   For the angle on the diagram above match the trigonometric function value with the appropriate line segment.                                   You may have wondered why secant is the reciprocal of cosine and not sine. Use the diagram, similar triangles, and the observation that to show that                                                Since the cotangent and cosecant literally mean complement s tangent and complement s secant we also have and .  Use a unit circle to illustrate and explain the following identities:                                             When we graph the points we get the sine wave. This follows from the fact that on a unit circle the radian measure of a central angle, , is equal to the length of the arc it cuts. So we get the sine wave when we roll the arc length out as a straight line on the -axis.    Notice that as the angle (arc) sweeps around the unit circle from to , the graph of cycles from (at ), to (at ), to (at ), to (at ), and back to (at ).   A similar development gives us the graph of .    Use the diagram above to explain why the cosine cycles from , to , to , to to . for . What are the precise values of where the cosine takes on those values?       Modeling with Trigonometric Functions  The sine and cosine functions are periodic functions. As such they are useful for modeling phenomena which are cyclical in nature; that is, phenomena which repeat the same pattern periodically. This periodicity is reflected in the formulas: The rationale for the term periodic is very evident when we graph on a set of axes.    As you can see a full cycle is completed over every interval of length . Thus the sine and cosine functions are said to be -periodic. We can start our cycle for any value of , but you are probably accustomed to graphing one complete cycle over the interval as in the graphs below.   Because and complete one cycle on an interval of they are called - periodic functions. Suppose that , , and are constants. Choose several non-zero values for , , and (at least three of each) and graph the function to show graphically that is also a -periodic function.              Notice that on any interval of length the function takes on every possible value between and , so the amplitude of this sine wave is . Changing the amplitude of a periodic function is easy. If we want an amplitude of then we just multiply by : . This new function will oscillate between and .  If we are modeling some real-world phenomenon then the amplitude will correspond to some physical attribute of the phenomenon. For example increasing the amplitude of a sound wave will increase the volume of the sound.  The sinusoidal axis is the horizontal line in the center of the range. So, for the sinusoidal axis is horizontal axis ( ) because the graph of is at the center of the range . Likewise the horizontal axis is the sinusoidal axis for . But if we have , this would shift the sinusoidal axis to the line , because this line would be at the center of the range and the wave would oscillate between and .   Suppose we had a sinusoidal wave oscillating between and . What would be the amplitude and what would be the sinusoidal axis of this wave?    The pitch of a sound wave is regulated by how fast the wave is oscillating. Faster oscillations mean higher pitches. Suppose we want a wave that oscillates once per second. Our base function, , oscillates once over the interval . Divide by , so that we have one oscillation occurring when . If we let so that then oscillates at a rate of one cycle per second as in the following graph.    Now suppose we want to double the frequency to oscillations per second. Again our base function oscillates once for . We want two oscillations per second or one oscillation per half second. So, we want . Letting we see that oscillates once every half second (or twice every second) as in the following graph.    The number of cycles per second is referred to as the number of Hertz (Hz). So oscillates at Hz and oscillates at Hz.   Historical Background  Named for Heinrich Rudolf Hertz, (1857 - 1894) .          Mimic the derivation above to determine so that oscillates at Hz.    The standard musical pitch is or , the musical note A above middle C. has a frequency of Hz. Determine so that an note can be modeled by . Do the same with each of the following notes.    , ( Hz)     , ( Hz)     , ( Hz)     , ( Hz)     , ( Hz)     , ( Hz)       Musical notes an octave higher have frequencies that are doubled. So, (one octave higher than ) has a frequency of Hz. Repeat part for , , , , , , and , each one octave higher than the corresponding note in part .                             Phase Shifts        There is one more aspect of periodic functions we need to address before we put all of this together, and that is the phase shift . To illustrate phase shift, consider the graph at the right. We last saw this graph when we introduced Fermat s Method of Adequality in Section . It represents the number of hours of daylight in Santa Barbara, CA over a given year. The graph of represents a full cycle (one year) but it is not quite the graph of as we would expect from our discussion of period and amplitude. The graph of gives the correct sinusoidal axis of , and the correct maximum and minimum but it does not quite match the blue graph.             We can easily see the problem if we compare our original graph (above) to the graph of as seen in the figure at the left. The two graphs clearly have the same shape but our guess has been shifted to the left by about days. Since the red graph represents the typical graph of a single cycle for a sine curve, we say that the blue graph has undergone a phase shift of days. Let s make this a bit more precise.  The red sine wave , shows that at day (January ) we have hours of daylight, and immediately thereafter the number of hours of daylight increases. But we know that this actually happens at the spring equinox, March or day . For the red graph to coincide with the blue graph we need for it to shift to the right so that it shows hours of daylight on day and completes one cycle in the interval .  To obtain the proper equation, we go back to basics. Our basic sine wave oscillates once for . To get the proper period, we have To get our phase shift, we add to each term to obtain     Let . Solve this for and use this to find a formula for the number of hours of daylight per day in Santa Barbara, CA on any given day with representing January 1. Graph this and compare your graph with the original graph.      Suppose we have a sine wave whose amplitude is given by , period is given by , sinusoidal axis is given by , and whose phase shift is given by . Show that the equation of this wave is     For each of the following waves find the amplitude, period, sinusoidal axis, and phase shift.                                              Do you see that the cosine curve is basically the sine curve with a phase shift? What is the value of the phase shift? We usually restrict the phase shift to values between and . Explain why this restriction is useful.     Polar Coordinates  When we say that the coordinates of point in the plane are we are referring to the Cartesian (or rectangular) coordinates . They are named in honor of René Descartes who, as we mentioned in Section , was one of the pioneers in applying algebra to geometry. The geometric picture that goes with this is shown below.             Using rectangular coordinates is one way to to translate geometry problems into algebra problems and vice versa . This simple idea changed forever how mathematics is done. Really.        But Cartesian coordinates are not the only way we can locate points in the plane. If we superimpose a right triangle on the diagram above, as shown at the left, we can find another way to locate . Since is the endpoint of the ray starting at the origin and ending at the ordered pair of numbers works just as well as the ordered pair . The numbers and are called the polar coordinates of .        There are advantages and disadvantages to either coordinate system. For example the coordinates in the Cartesian system are unique. There is only point with rectangular coordinates, (where and ). This is not true of polar coordinates. The point with polar coordinates (where and ) is the same as the point with polar coordinates (where and ). It is also the same as the point with polar coordinates , where (gasp!). The idea of a negative value for is a little jarring because we usually think of the negative sign as denoting negative numbers. Instead, think of it as meaning go the opposite direction.    Comment  Thinking this way also explains why the negative of a negative must be positive. The number is at the endpoint of a ray pointing to the right along the -axis. If we put a negative sign in front we go the opposite direction to . Another negative will reverse the direction again.    Explain why the polar coordinates , , all locate the same point in the plane. Find at least three other sets of polar coordinates that identify the same point. How many are there?   The following pairs of points are given in polar coordinates. Plot them all on the same set of axes and then check your answers using your favorite graphing software.    and      and      and      and      and      and                      Of course, we ll need to be able to translate from one coordinate system to the other.    Use the diagram above to show that if in polar coordinates, and in rectangular coordinates then,    ,     ,            In Cartesian coordinates the equation of a circle centered at the origin with radius is . What is the equation of the same circle in polar coordinates?   Use the result from part .                       Just like the Cartesian coordinates the order of polar coordinates matters. The radius comes first, and the angle comes second. Notice that there is nothing in the ordered pair notation that tells you which system is in play. This will usually be clear from the context but if you are ever unsure whether the ordered pair represents Cartesian or polar coordinates ask your instructor.   Plot the points and twice. First assume that they are polar coordinates and then assume that they Cartesian coordinates.   The graph of an equation given in polar coordinates is quite different from one given in Cartesian coordinates. To get a sense of this sketch the graph of each of the following functions in polar coordinates Most graphing software has a built-in polar mode which will do this for you. This can be helpful once you are thoroughly familiar with the polar coordinate system but in the beginning you should do the graphing without the use of graphing software. Use technology to verify your graph after you ve drawn it by hand. .                                                                                         An advantage of using polar coordinates is that the formula that describes a curve can be extraordinarily complicated if we give as a function of but extraordinarily simple if we give as a function of . For example, consider the following Spiral of Archimedes :     In polar coordinates the Spiral of Archimedes is the graph of the equation . Convert this to an equation in Cartesian coordinates.   Use the results of       The Differentials of the Sine and Cosine Functions       Circular Motion       Recall that when a central angle , of a unit circle is measured in radians then the arclength subtended by that angle will also be as seen in the sketch at the left. Similarly, when we increase the angle by the blue arc is also of length . Moreover, by the Principle of Local Linearity the blue arc length can be thought of as an infinitely small straight line. Thus it is the hypotenuse of the blue triangle.       Notice that when is increased by , is increased by , but is decreased by which makes negative. But the sides of a triangle must be positive so the label on the blue triangle is .  Referring to ,   Show that     Show that     Show that and are similar.     The relevant portion of are the two similar triangles shown in the diagram below.              Using the two similar triangles we have And so we have the following Differentiation Rules. Memorize them.

The following sketch represents a Ferris wheel rotating counterclockwise at a rate of one revolution every two minutes.    How fast is a rider rising when his seat is meters above the ground? What is the height of the rider when he is rising the fastest?      Polar Coordinates and Calculus  In Section we introduced the polar coordinates and the equations which allow us to convert from polar to rectangular coordinates.  Given a functional relation between and like those we saw in it should be clear that the differential ratio is not the slope of the tangent line. However it is still the rate of change of with respect to .  Regardless of which coordinate system we use, the slope of the line tangent to a curve is still given by for the same reason that gives the slope of the line: Both and represent a displacement in the vertical direction divided by a displacement in the horizontal direction.

The Brachistochrone Problem             Suppose a bead is sliding down a frictionless wire from point to point as seen below.   Assuming that the bead starts at rest and slides down the wire under the influence of gravity only, what shape do you think the wire must have if the bead descends from to in the least possible time. Galileo thought the path of least time had to be a circular arc as we ve drawn it here, but he could not prove it. Think about this for a moment before reading on. What does your intuition tell you the solution must be?   Terminology   Brachistochrone comes from two Greek words meaning least time.    This question is known as the Brachistochrone Problem. In 1696 the Swiss mathematician Johann Bernoulli published the statement of the Brachistochrone Problem along with the following challenge:   I, Johann Bernoulli, address the most brilliant mathematicians in the world. Nothing is more attractive to intelligent people than an honest, challenging problem, whose possible solution will bestow fame and remain as a lasting monument. Following the example set by Pascal, Fermat, etc., I hope to gain the gratitude of the whole scientific community by placing before the finest mathematicians of our time a problem which will test their methods and the strength of their intellect. If someone communicates to me the solution of the proposed problem, I shall publicly declare him worthy of praise.   At the time an acrimonious rivalry existed between Continental and British mathematicians concerning whether Newton s Method of Fluxions or Leibniz  Calculus Differentialis was the better approach to Calculus. Bernoulli didn t believe Newton would be able to solve the Brachistochrone Problem so the challenge was intended in part to show that Leibniz approach was better.  At that point in his life Newton had stopped doing science. He had been appointed England s Warden of the Mint and was given the Herculean task of recalling and replacing all of the country s coinage. He had nothing to gain by attempting the problem but the challenge probably irritated him because he later complained,   I do not love . . . to be . . . teezed by forreigners about Mathematical things.   According to his niece, Catherine Conduitt,   When the problem in was sent by Bernoulli Sir I. N. was in the midst of the great recoinage and did not come home till four from the Tower very much tired, but did not sleep till he had solved it, which was by four in the morning.   Newton submitted his solution anonymously but the presentation was so uniquely in his style of written mathematics that when he received it Bernoulli immediately recognized that the solution had come from Newton because, as he put it,   I know the lion by his claw.   Johann Bernoulli also received solutions from his student, the Marquis de L Hôpital (whom we will meet again in Chapter ), his older brother Jacob Bernoulli, and Leibniz. Of course Johann had a solution of his own as well.             It turned out that the path of least time is an inverted cycloid . A cycloid is the curve generated by tracing the path of a point on the edge of a wheel as it rolls in a straight line without slipping, like the bicycle wheel belwo   The solution of the the Brachistochrone Problem is a bit beyond the scope of this course. But its solution, the cycloid curve, had been studied long before the invention of Calculus. Naturally, the invention of Calculus gave us a new window on the properties of cycloids.  For example, if you make a bowl whose cross section is an inverted cycloid then objects sliding to the center (again, we ignore friction) will take the same length of time to reach the bottom regardless of their starting position. This is known as the Tautochrone Problem. Christiaan Huygens used this fact to design a better pendulum clock than had previously existed. This is explored in more depth in          It would be difficult to express the cycloid as the graph of some curve: . But it is fairly simple to parameterize it, as we will see in Problem~\\ . In our parameterization will still represent an angle but this time the vertex of the angle is at the center of the wheel, which is in motion. This makes the parameterization a little more interesting\\aside{Often, interesting also means more challenging. }. The placement of is shown schematically in the next problem.    Let be a point on a circle of radius that is rolling on the -axis and let be the position of when the ball has rolled through an angle of .         Use the diagram above to show that the parameterization of is given by     Compute and in terms of     Find the slope of the tangent line to the cycloid at an arbitrary point in terms of and use this to confirm that the tangent line is horizontal at the apex of the cycloid, point in our diagram.    Show that and use this to examine the slope of the cycloid near the points where it touches the -axis.          Suppose the circle is rolling at an angular speed of and compute the tangential speed, of . What do you notice about the speed of in relation to the circle s radius? Do you find this surprising? (Consider using .)    When is moving the fastest and when is it moving the slowest? Does this make sense physically?                                                                  Spin Casting, Redux  In Section we saw how Newton s fluxional approach to Calculus led us naturally to the notion of parametric equations, .            Recall that in the Problem~\\ we asserted, without justification, that the centripetal force holding the spinning, molten glass in its circular path is given by the formula . We now have the tools we need to justify this claim.   If an object having mass , is revolving in a circle of radius meters around an axis with an angular velocity of radians\/second, the centripetal force that keeps it moving in a circle is directed toward the center of the circle. Anything moving in a circular path is held on course by a centripetal or center seeking force.  Recall that force and acceleration are related by Newton s Second Law of Motion: Thus to show that the force is what we said it was we ll need to show that the centripetal acceleration is given by .    To compute centripetal acceleration, we will consider the point traveling around the circle, with radius , so that its position at time is given by The velocity in the direction of motion, , is tangent to the circle and is composed of the velocity in the direction and the velocity in the direction : as seen below.      The magnitude of the velocity (speed) in the direction of motion is the length of . Show that the speed of is given by:    Use the Pythagorean Theorem.  Note: This result also follows directly from the definition of radian measure. We want you to do it this way in this problem because you will do a similar computation for acceleration in part below.    Assume that the angular velocity is constant: . Acceleration, like velocity, consists of a magnitude and a direction. In this case, the centripetal acceleration, represented by in our diagram below, is composed of the vertical acceleration and horizontal acceleration     The length of the arrow, is the magnitude of the centripetal acceleration. Compute and , and show that the length of the centripetal acceleration is given by which is what we said it was in .                                                                                                                                DIGRESSION: The Centripetal and Tangential Forces  Digression Centripetal and Tangential Forces  In we assumed the angular velocity, was constant, so that we could focus our attention on the centripetal force that keeps the point moving in a circle. In only the centripetal force was in play. But consider a model airplane flying at the end of a cord, as in the sketch below.    Now we have two forces to contend with. The tension in the cord (shown in red) supplies the centripetal (center seeking) force, while the force of the engine (thrust) will always be in the direction of motion, tangential to the path at (shown in blue). Since the airplane will speed up or slow down depending on the magnitude of the thrust the airplane is no longer constrained to fly at a constant angular velocity.  Finding an expression for the centripetal and tangential acceleration is a straightforward, though somewhat daunting, exercise in differentiation.    Show that if a point, , is constrained to move in a circle (so that and ) but that is no longer constant, then the horizontal acceleration and the vertical acceleration are given by,           From Newton s Second Law of Motion, ( ), we see that the horizontal and vertical forces acting on the airplane are and . We d like to resolve these into their centripetal and tangential components.   Show that the red terms in equations  and are the horizontal and vertical components of the centripetal acceleration by confirming that they are the same as the and that you computed for part of .                suggests that the red terms in equations  and are the horizontal and vertical components of the centripetal acceleration. If that is true (it is) then the blue terms must represent the tangential acceleration. Thus, by Newton s Second Law, we obtain the horizontal and vertical components of the tangential force by multiplying the horizontal and vertical accelerations by . This gives us   Horizontal Force:      Vertical Force:     All of our results so far are depicted in the sketch at the right.   Finally, we let represent the length of the circular arc traced by at time . Since is measured in radians we know that the length of a circular arc, is . Applying the Constant Multiple Rule we see that Since represents an infinitesimal displacement tangent to the circle we see that is the tangential velocity of the airplane.  Differentiating again using the Constant Multiple Rule we see that is the tangential acceleration. So equations  and can be expressed as   In this form these equations express the relationship between the various accelerations in play (horizontal, vertical, centripetal, and tangential). The forces are obtained from Newton s Second Law by multiplying both sides of both equations by the mass, . We, the authors, think of this as uncancelling  .   Use the diagram above to show that the magnitude of the thrust, , is given by    END OF DIGRESSION     Simple Harmonic Oscillation  Much of what occurs in the real world recurs periodically. As we saw in the number of hours of daylight in Santa Barbara, California (and everywhere else) changes regularly over the course of a year The sun, moon, and stars rise and set regularly ever hours. The compression of your heart muscle repeats periodically every few seconds. Can you think of other examples of periodic behavior in the natural world?  The usefulness of the trigonometric functions, especially the sine and cosine, comes from the fact that they are also periodic. With enough effort the sine and cosine functions can be used to model any periodic behavior, but the phrase with enough effort covers a lot. It is possible to model the compression of your heart using only sines and cosines, but the required theory and methods are beyond the scope of this text. We ll keep things simple.  A function is said to be a Simple Harmonic Oscillator (SHO) if it satisfies the second order differential equation  for some constant . Equation is a little scary at first but it really isn t that bad. To simplify things suppose for a moment that . Then we have which says simply that is a function whose second derivative is equal the negative of itself.  Of course, you already know two such functions. Since  and are both SHOs.   Find two more SHOs.   Don t overthink this. Build from the two that you already know.    Equation is used to model vibrations of buildings, acoustics, AC circuits, molecular, and crystal vibrations; basically anything that oscillates, but where the effects of air resistance are negligible. In , after we have expanded our repertoire of functions a bit, we will look at one way we can incorporate the role of air resistance into our computations so that we can extend the usefulness of our analysis.        Show that satisfies Equation . for any constants and .    Determine the values of the constants and if and plot the graph of for these values of and .                    The classical physical example of a simple harmonic oscillator is an object with mass, , hanging from one end of a spring, as shown below.   A Simple Harmonic Oscillator: A Hanging Mass    In this sketch the horizontal axis is time so it shows the same bouncing spring at three different times. Assume that our spring is anchored in some way at the top. When the weight of the object and the restoring force of the spring balance exactly we say that they are in equilibrium as illustrated by the leftmost spring in our sketch. Robert Hooke (1635 1703), who we encountered back in Section , was a leading elder scientist when Newton was young and a rising star in English science. Hooke was the first to show that the restoring force exerted by a spring (the force back toward equilibrium) is directly proportional to the length of its extension beyond equilibrium. This is known today as Hooke’s Law for Springs (or just Hooke s Law ) and it is true whether the spring is stretched or compressed.    Robert Hooke, (1635 1703)          If we let denote the vertical displacement of the mass from equilibrium then Hooke s Law says that the restoring force of the spring is given by , for some positive constant (called the spring constant ). For a relatively weak spring, would have a small value. For a relatively strong spring, the value of would be large. If we let represent the restoring force acting on the hanging mass then we have Since the spring constant, , is positive the negative sign in front of is necessary. But it is easy to misinterpret this. The negative sign does not mean that the force is always negative (upward in our diagram). In the analysis above the sign of will be the negative (opposite) of the direction of the displacement of . If the spring is displaced in the positive direction (stretched downward in our diagram) then the in front guarantees that the force, , will be negative (upward). Conversely if we displace the spring in the negative direction (compressed upward in the diagram) then the guarantees that is positive.  As we have seen the acceleration of an object is the second derivative of its position with respect to time, or . Thus according to Newton’s Second Law, the force acting on our mass will satisfy . Finally, since represents the same force in both Hooke s Law and Newton's Second Law, we see that the vertical displacement of our mass must satisfy the equation which is equivalent to equation ).   Show that equations and are equivalent as we ve claimed.   What is in Equation ?    DIGRESSION: Neglecting Gravity  Digression Neglecting Gravity  You may be wondering why we ve consistently neglected the force due to gravity (which will be the weight of the object or where is it s mass and ) in equation ). Actually, this was accounted for when we chose our coordinate system so that at the equilibrium point. At equilibrium the upward force from the spring exactly balances the downward force of gravity (that s why it's called equilibrium) so we can proceed as if those forces are not there. This does not say that there are no other forces acting on the object, only that such forces as exist are exactly in balance; they add to zero.  If you buy this intuitive argument, then fine. If not, work through the following problem.      Remember that the positive direction is downward. Assume that the weight of the object extends the spring a distance of as shown, and that is the vertical displacement of the object from equilibrium.    Notice that the downward force is the weight of the object and the upward force is the pull of the spring.    Show that the vertical displacement of the object satisfies the equation     Use the fact that when the object is at rest, to conclude that and use this to conclude that the spring-object system still satisfies equation                        END OF DIGRESSION     Show that will satisfy .    Compute and . If we are modeling a mass-spring system, what do these values represent physically?    Compare the graphs of for each of the following choices of and .    , ,     , ,     , .   In particular, how do the values of and affect the frequency of the oscillation? Is this consistent with what and represent physically?    For which values of do the greatest and smallest velocities occur? What is the acceleration at each of these points? Is this consistent with the idea that the mass is transitioning from speeding up to slowing down and vice versa ? Explain.    For which values of is the acceleration the largest and the smallest? Is this consistent with both Newton s Second Law and Hooke s Law? Explain.                                  The Differentials of the Other Trigonometric Functions  Once the differential of is known, the differentials of the other trigonometric functions are easily computed. Since our current goal is simply to develop the tools we will need later we will not spend any more time on this than necessary.  Observe that by definition , so the Quotient Rule applies: and since we have    Use the Quotient Rule to show that    Observe that by definition . Differentiating, we have and making the substitution as indicated we have . By the Power Rule this is Simplifying gives so that, finally we have    By similar means show that .   Remember all of those identities you had to memorize in Trigonometry? You can reduce that memorization burden a bit by using Calculus. If two variable quantities are equal then their differentials must be equal too. So if you differentiate both sides an identity you get another identity!   Consider the double angle formula for the sine function: . Differentiating gives or which is the double angle formula for the cosine function.     We know that no matter what value has, so we d expect that differential of to be zero. Let s check.  By the Sum Rule and by the Power Rule we have     Since the sine and cosine functions are both differentiable and we can conclude that is (probably) equal to some constant. If we didn t already know, how could we conclude that the constant is    We now know the differentials of all of the trigonometric functions. These are shown in the table below. Memorize them.

Verify each identity (including the one you compute) by graphing the expression on both sides of the equals sign.                                               If possible find an equation of the line tangent to the graphs of and at each of the points below. If no such line exists explain why not.

The Inverse Tangent and Cotangent Functions  If is the tangent of , , then we say that is the arctangent of , . Speaking loosely, we d like for the arctangent to be a function which undoes the tangent.    The sketch above shows the graph of (in red) and the same graph (in blue) reflected about the graph of the line (dashed, in black). Reflecting in this manner swaps the coordinates of each point. For example, the point is on the graph of , because . Similarly, the point is on the graph of .  But is it true that ? If we are to believe our graph, it could be true. But couldn t it also be true that , or even ? The blue graph above is clearly the graph of the arctangent as we have defined it but we seem to have a choice for the output of . Many choices, in fact.  Having more than one output for a given input clearly violates what we mean when we use the word function. A mathematical function returns exactly one output for a given input. There is no choice. The sketch of the arctangent (in blue) is not the graph of a function . It is the graph of the multifunction  . Each of the blue curves on the right is one branch of the multifunction, . In fact all of the arc functions from trigonometry are multifunctions. Multfunctions are interesting objects and are well worth studying. But this is not the time for that study. Right now we are only interested in the properties of the inverse function of . Since is not a function, it can t be the inverse function of so we will stop thinking about it as soon as we can.   Mathematical Terminology  Note that by itself, any single branch of the arctangent is a function.   But if is not the inverse of what is? Since we only allow one output for a given input, could it be as simple as choosing just one of the branches of the , say the one that lies between and , shown below, and calling it the the inverse of ?    Actually, yes. It is just that simple. And the usual choice is the one we ve indicated. In this text we will designate this branch of with . Thus denotes the inverse tangent function. Because the multifunction arctangent is not a function we will henceforth ignore it as much as possible.   DIGRESSION: Inverse Function Notation  Digression Inverse Function Notation   The use of as an exponent is probably the most common notation used to indicate function inversion. Unfortunately, from the standpoint of a student it is also probably the worst notation we could have possibly invented because It is so very easily confused with reciprocation. While it is true that it is important to remember that   That the notation is used for both comes from the fact that both and really are inverses. But they are different kinds of inverses: is the multiplicative inverse of , which means simply that On the other hand is the functional inverse of , which means that if then and that   In equation you can think of the in the exponent as an operator. It operates on by taking its reciprocal: . In equation the is not an operator. It is part of the symbol, , that we use to denote the inverse tangent.  With practice this all gets easier, but in the beginning it is very troublesome. Be careful.  Evaluate each of the following:                                END OF DIGRESSION   But what, exactly, is the inverse of? From the sketch above it should be clear that restricting the range of to values in the interval forced us to restrict the domain of . So is the inverse of and it is not the inverse of because that function has no inverse.  An easy way to remember what means is to read the symbol as the angle whose tangent is .   The advantage of this phrasing is that it emphasizes that is the tangent of some angle, and is that angle. Similarly the inverse functions of the other trigonometric functions should be read as the angle whose sine, cosine, secant, (or whatever) is . Each of these will also come with suitable restrictions on its range.  We should point out that reserving the arc notation for the trigonometric multifunctions is actually a conceit of the authors of this text. Most of the world uses and interchangeably, and eventually you will too. But for now it will be helpful for you to keep in mind that the difference between them is that restricting the range of to guarantees that it is a function. But since the range of is not similarly restricted it is not a function.     Suppose we had chosen . What function (with domain) is that the inverse of?   All of this fussiness is really just about making our abstract definitions useful and consistent. It would be nice if these details only impinged on us in an abstract setting but unfortunately some practical difficulties do come up, as the following drill shows.    Find all solutions of and . Do they have the same set of solutions?    Obviously, they do not. Otherwise we wouldn t have asked the question. What is the difference between the two sets of solutions?     DIGRESSION: The Tangent Function Has No Inverse  Digression The Tangent Function Has No Inverse  The function is not invertible. This is because, by custom, its domain is all real numbers (except ) . Thus it is not the same function as A function has two parts: (1) The set of inputs (domain) and (2) the rule associating input with output. Most of the time the domain is the set of all real numbers ( ), so we don t bother to explicitly state that the domain of, say is . Unless otherwise specified we simply assume that it is. Properly speaking, we should always specify the domain of our functions, but typically we don t. The custom is to assume that the domain of a function is unless otherwise stated. Thus the function, cannot be inverted because on its domain ( ) it has more than one branch.  Because we both want and need an inverse tangent function we restrict the range of . But this is the inverse of , with domain , which has only one branch. It is not the inverse of , because it has too many branches.  To use our notation as it was intended to be used we should say that is the inverse of , with domain , which is true. But instead, we typically just say that it is the inverse of , which strictly speaking, is not true.  When we (mathematicians) talk amongst ourselves this is not a problem. We all understand what we mean. But it can be very confusing for students who usually have a more tenuous grasp of these distinctions. It is a bit unfair of us (mathematicians) to speak to students in what amount to incomplete sentences, but we tend to do it anyway, mostly out of habit.  We (the authors) apologize.  END OF DIGRESSION   The definition of the arccotangent is similar to the definition of the arctangent: If is the cotangent of , , then we say that is the arccotangent of , and write The arccotangent is also a multifunction with multiple branches so, just as before, we will have to decide which branch to use to define the inverse cotangent: .  We obtained our branch for the single-valued function from the multifunction by restricting its range to . A similar restriction would allow us to obtain the single-valued function from the multifunction , but it is a bit simpler to once again use a trigonometric identity.   Use the identity to choose an appropriate range for the function .     The Witch of Agnesi and the Inverse Tangent Function    Maria Gaëtana Agnesi (1718 1799)            In a time when women had very few options in life Maria Gaëtana Agnesi (1718 1799) was both exceptional and very lucky. Her brilliance and talent were recognized early and nurtured by her wealthy father, who encouraged her studies and provided her with the best possible tutors to develop her talents. She mastered the Calculus of Newton and Leibniz and in wrote a series of textbooks on the topic titled Instituzioni Analitiche ad Uso Della Gioventù Italiana ( Analytical Methods for the use of Italian Youth ). It was immediately recognized as a masterpiece of mathematical exposition and was used throughout Europe during eighteenth century. It was by far the most popular Calculus textbook in use at the time. An Englishman, John Colson , was so impressed with Agnesi s work that in 1760 he took it upon himself to learn Italian specifically so that he could translate her text into English.   Pronunciation  Her name is pronounced Awn-yes-ee, not Ag-nes-ee.    In her text Agnesi collected many of the known results of the time and organized them for the instruction of students. The Latin name of one of the curves that she used for instruction is versoria ( rope that turns a sail ) because of its shape. Agnesi correctly translated this into Italian as la versiera. Unfortunately Colson mistook this for l aversiera which means witch. As a result this particular curve has been known ever since as the Witch of Agnesi.             As modern function notation was yet to be invented Agnesi understood this curve geometrically as a particular set of points. In the diagram below think of as moving from left to right. For each value of , draw the line from the origin to and locate the vertical coordinate where this line intersects the circle centered at , with radius . Every point is a point on the Witch of Agnesi. The Witch itself is the curve shown in red.     In the diagram above show that the coordinates and satisfy the equation, . Thus the Witch is the graph of     Whenever you encounter a new curve an important question to ask is, What is its derivative? In this case you already have everything you need to find the answer.   Show that if then               Computing the derivative of a function as a formula is very useful. This has in fact been our primary focus so far in this text. However to truly understand the relationship between a function and its derivative nothing can replace seeing both of them graphed together. Look closely at the relationship between the Witch and its derivative in the sketch at the right. Is it clear how these graphs are related?   Notice in particular that when the coordinate of the Witch is at its highest point (maximum value), whereas the coordinate of is zero.  We know that the derivative of a curve at a given point gives us the slope of the line tangent at that point. Thus at the highest point of the Witch the line tangent to it will be horizontal. That is, the derivative of the Witch will be zero. This is exactly what these two graphs are showing us.  When is just to the right of zero, the slope of the Witch is close to zero and negative. Similarly just to the left of zero the slope of the Witch is close to zero and positive. At the extreme right end of the graph above the slope of the Witch is close to zero and negative and at the extreme left it is close to zero and positive. And all of this is reflected in the shape of the blue (derivative) curve.  It is a little more interesting to reverse this process. That is, suppose we could see only the derivative of the Witch (blue curve). Could we figure out the shape of the Witch from this?  Sure we can. Well, almost.  Consider: From the extreme left of the graph to the coordinate of the (blue) derivative curve is above the axis. Therefore the slope of the Witch is positive. Clearly wherever the slope of a function is positive the function is increasing, so we can deduce that the Witch increases from left to right until we reach where the blue derivative function crosses the -axis.  Thereafter the coordinate of the blue derivative curve is below the axis. That is, the slope of the Witch is negative, so the Witch is decreasing.  Just by looking at the derivative curve we can see that the Witch of Agnesi increases from left to right until we reach and after that it decreases. Although this shows us the shape of the Witch we do not have enough information to completely describe the Witch of Agnesi. We can tell a lot about a curve by looking at the graph of its derivative but we can t tell everything.   In the sketch below the red curve is the graph of the Witch and the blue curve is the graph of its derivative. Convince yourself that the blue curve could also be the graph of the derivative of any of the other curves shown as well. As clearly as you can, explain what this suggests about the relationship between a function and its derivative.     Next we d like to apply this same sort of reasoning to the Witch itself. We d like to answer the question, What curve is the Witch of Agnesi the derivative of? Whatever that curve is, we ll call it the antiderivative of the Witch for obvious reasons.    As before, by simply looking at the graph of the Witch we can see that: (1) At the extreme ends of its graph the antiderivative will have a positive slope which gets closer and closer to zero as we go farther from the origin, but (2) since the Witch never crosses the -axis the antiderivative will never have a horizontal slope, and (3) at the slope of the antiderivative will be equal to one. A sketch of the antiderivative of the Witch begins to emerge when we put these three observations into our graph:    Continuing to fill between the black segments in the same fashion the sketch becomes even clearer:    Finally, connecting the dots with a smooth curve we see the the graph of the antiderivative of the Witch of Agnesi must look like this:    We ve been a little lazy with our use of language. As we saw in , the antiderivative is not unique, so it is improper to speak of the antiderivative. Any one of the curves shown below could be an antiderivative of the Witch of Agnesi. (Except the black one, of course. That s the Witch.)    This graph should look very familiar to you. It looks very much like the graph of the arctangent function we discussed in Section , doesn t it? Do you suppose it is possible that the derivative of the arctangent function is the Witch of Agnesi?  Of course it is. Why else would we have led you down this path? But there are some subtleties here that we shouldn t ignore. For example we will want to find a function that is the antiderivative of the Witch. We will proceed cautiously.  The following exercise is not directly related to the Witch of Agnesi. We include it so that you can get practice relating the graphs of functions, there derivatives, and their antiderivatives, as this is a very useful skill. We will need it in a far more substantial way in when we get there.    Sketch the graph of the derivative and the antiderivative of each of the following curves on the same set if axes,                                    The Differentials of the Inverse Tangent and Inverse Cotangent Functions                 Since we want to find a function whose derivative is the Witch of Agnesi and we are pretty sure that each of the branches of the arctangent multifunction takes the shape of the Witch s antiderivative it is tempting to assume that the branch of the arctangent shown belwo is the function we are looking for.   In fact, this is correct, but we must be careful. Reasoning from pictures, as we ve just done, can be very useful. but the most we can hope for when reasoning from pictures is an intuitive feel for the problem. We always need to confirm our intuition analytically. Always.  So we will verify, analytically, our conjecture that the derivative of the inverse tangent function is the Witch of Agnesi. From our definition of we know that precisely when\\aside{Notice how cavalierly we ve ignored the necessary constraints on the domain of the tangent. The function is not the inverse of because the domain of is . It is the inverse of , with domain, . The domain is part of the definition of the function.} . Differentiating gives:        This is a correct formula for the differential of the arctangent function. However, there are two problems: (1) it does not seem to match our conjecture, and (2) even if it is correct this formula will not be very useful to us in this form since we have in terms of itself. We can address both of these problems by finding in terms of and .   Referring to the diagram above, recall from that so . The hypotenuse in the diagram at the right is so from the Pythagorean Theorem we see that . Thus or So our intuition was correct. The Witch is indeed the derivative of the arctangent function. A similar derivation can be used for the arccotangent.        The inverse cotangent function is defined as if and only if . Proceed as we did above to show that     Derive the same result from the identity .                      Show that if then satisfies the differential equation     The function satisfies the same differential equation. Show this in two different ways.   By direct computation, just as you did part .    By direct computation, after first observing that .                                Show that each of the following statements is true.                        This is weird isn t it? None of the functions on the left is but they all have the same derivative as . Can you explain this?   Let and . What is ?    Now show that where is an arbitrary constant.                                The Other Inverse Trigonometric Functions              Despite how much time we spent talking about them, the single valued branches for and , were actually fairly apparent from the graphs of and . All we had to do was choose one continuous branch from either graph. We described the process carefully because for the other inverse trigonometric functions things are a little more problematic. For those we will have to use the derivatives of our arc multifunctions as a guide, rather than the multifunctions themselves.  In general, we define an arcfunction as precisely when . So, when and when .    The Inverse Sine Function:  When we graph by flipping the graph of across the graph of the line we get the sketch below. For the value of shown in the sketch the arrows point to a few of the possible values of . There are infinitely many, so obviously is also a multifunction, not a function.   To find the differentials of and we proceed just as we did with the and . If then so:    Use the diagram below, to show that            Use the fact that if and only if and proceed as we did in to show that Notice how this formula differs from the one you found in .    Derive the same result from the identity: .                    The World s Most Evil Mathematician, by Ben Orlin            The plus\/minus and minus\/plus that appear in equations and , respectively, are present because, and are both multifunctions like .  Since is not a function at all it can t be the inverse function of . Once again, to create an inverse sine function (which we will call ) we will have to restrict the range of just like we restricted the range of . The question is, what restriction should we impose?  When we were looking to restrict the range of the there was a natural choice that was clearly visible in the graph. Notice that the derivative of (and thus the derivative of ) is always positive while the derivative of the (and thus the derivative of ) is always negative. This happens naturally for the tangent and cotangent, but not for the arcsine, the arccosine or the other trigonometric functions.  But this does suggest how we might proceed. As you can see in the sketch at the right the slope of is sometimes positive and sometimes negative. Since we must restrict the range of , we may as well make a convenient choice. We d like to constrain the range of the inverse sine in such a way that its derivative is always positive, and we d like to constrain the range of the inverse cosine in such a way that its derivative is always negative.              From the sketch we see that if we restrict the range of to the interval the graph of (in blue) will always\\aside{Except at the endpoints of course. What do you think the slope of is at ? have a positive slope, and therefore a positive derivative.  With this restriction in place we define the derivative of the inverse sine as follows.   The Derivative of the Inverse Sine    The derivative of the inverse sine function is defined to be, , where .      What function is , as defined in Definition the inverse off?    Naturally, is the inverse of , but with which domain?    Similarly, if we restrict the range of to its derivative will always be negative.   The Derivative of the Inverse Cosine    The derivative of the inverse sine function is defined to be, , where .          Show that if then satisfies the differential equation     The function satisfies the same differential equation. Show this in two different ways.   By direct computation, just as you did in part .    By direct computation, after first observing that .                                 The Inverse Secant and Inverse Cosecant         To find the differential of we refer to the sketch above and we proceed exactly as before. If , then so so that         Show that:          Use the fact that if and only if and proceeding as we did above, show that     Derive the same result from the identity: .                     Show that if then satisfies the differential equation     The function satisfies the same differential equation. Show this in two different ways.   By direct computation, just as you did part .    By direct computation, after first observing that .                              Again we will want to define the inverse secant, by restricting the range of the multifunction in such a way that the derivative of will always be positive. Similarly for the inverse cosecant function.  But forcing the derivative of the inverse secant to always be positive is a bit harder for a couple of reasons. The first is just that these functions are used less and thus we are not as familiar with them. The other is the nature of the derivative formula itself. Recall that This time it is the presence of the in the denominator along with the in the numerator that is troublesome. By choosing the range constraint judiciously we can control whether the plus or the minus is chosen in the numerator but any reasonable constraint on the range of will always include both positive and negative numbers in its domain. So the in the denominator will make the derivative of positive for some values and negative for others. We don t want that. We want it to be positive.  Usually when we want things in the world to be simple, Nature just laughs at us. But not this time. This time the problem is simply that we have too many choices. Both the in the numerator and the in the denominator will influence the sign (positive or negative) of the expression . If they are both in play it is hard to control the sign. So to simplify things we just declare, by fiat, that the in the denominator will be positive. Specifically, we ll replace the in the denominator with . Now we can control the sign of the derivative of the by simply constraining its range.    The sketch below shows that if we constrain the range of the to be the interval then      Use the identity to show that                   Until now there has been a pattern to differentiation that we have not remarked on. But you may have noticed that when we differentiate a function we usually get back another function of the same type. That is,   The derivative of a polynomial is another polynomial,    The derivative of a quotient of polynomials is another quotient of polynomials,    The derivative of a trigonometric function is another trigonometric function.     The inverse trigonometric functions break this pattern. The derivative of an inverse trigonometric function is not another inverse trigonometric function. Nor is it a trigonometric function, a polynomial, or a quotient of polynomials\\aside{Well, actually that s not quite true. The derivative of the inverse tangent is a quotient of polynomials, and a particularly simple one at that. But it is not an inverse trigonometric function}.  Do you suppose there is any significance to this?  The inverse trigonometric functions will not have a significant role in our story for a while. However they will be very useful in some topics that will come up next semester. We ve introduced them here simply because it makes sense to develop all of the differentiation rules at more or less the same time.  We now have differentiation formulas for all of the inverse trigonometric functions. These, along with the constraints on their ranges are given in the table below. Memorize them! You will need them.   Derivatives of Inverse Trigonometric Functions    Function  Domain  Range Derivative       All real numbers          All real numbers                                       and    and          and    and                    Compute each of the following:                                             Find the Pattern   Show that for any constant ,                                                       Show that           Show that each of the following statements is true.

Part says that the graphs of and have the same slope when so their graphs should differ by a constant. Substitute into both to see what this constant should be.    Now plot the graphs of both. Do they differ by a constant? Explain why or why not.                     Curvature  \\TLogo{appendix:radi-curv-accord}  Intuitively speaking, the curvature of a plane curve is how quickly a curve turns. It is an important property to understand when designing, for example, a road or a roller-coaster where the sharpness of a curve determines the safe speed limit for that curve. Also, the stresses imposed on the physical structure of a moving object during any high speed maneuver are directly related to the curvature of their paths.   Pronunciation  Oresme is pronouced Or-em, not Or-es-me.    One of the first people to study the notion of curvature was Nicole Oresme (1323 1382). Oresme defined the curvature of a straight line to be zero (no surprise), and he defined the curvature of a circle to be the reciprocal of its radius. For example, a circle with radius is whereas the curvature of a circle with radius is . This makes intuitive sense. A circle with a smaller radius is more curved that one with a larger radius. The radius of the earth is so large that the curvature of say, the equator, is so close to zero as to be completely imperceptible, at least for someone standing on the surface.             Oresme s definition of curvature works just fine for circles and straight lines but we d like to extend it to more general curves. Specifically, given a curve, we d like to associate a number with each point on the curve which tells us the curvature at that point. Ideally, this should also generalize Oresme s results for straight lines and circles.   The sketch above shows three circles in the first quadrant with radii, , , and , respectively. Notice that on the unit circle, the point of tangency travels units along the circumference while the the red tangent line rotates through an angle of radians. On the circle of radius , the point of tangency travels units to turn the tangent line the same radians, whereas on the circle of radius , the point of tangency travels units to turn the tangent line the same radians. This suggests that a possible definition for curvature might be the number of radians the tangent line rotates through as it travels along the curve divided by the distance traveled along the curve while making the turn. In other words, the curvature for a circle of radius would be This seems to make intuitive sense too. A circle with a radius of meters certainly seems to be more curved than a circle with radius meters.  By the same reasoning, the curvature of a straight line would be zero. (Why?)  This definition works fine for circles and straight lines which have constant curvature, but what about a more general curve. What if the curvature changes from point to point along the curve such as a long and winding road.  Clearly we ll need a definition of curvature that also changes from point to point on the curve. So it seems reasonable to consider infinitely small changes in both the angle and in arclength . More precisely, we make the following definition.   Curvature    Suppose the point lies on a curve as in the sketch below.            Let represent the angle formed in the figure above by the line tangent to curve at point , with some fixed line.  Then the curvature is defined to be     To keep things simple we will always designate to be the angle the tangent line forms with a horizontal line.  It can be difficult at first to see how formula measures curvature but think carefully for a moment about the meaning of the expression . Loosely put the rate of change of (the angle of our curve with the horizontal) with respect to the change of (the arclength of our curve) is the ratio of how much a point moving on the curve has changed direction to how far it has moved. The more our curve changes direction in a given distance the more it is curved and so the more curvature it has.  Don t let the absolute value bars in this formula disturb you. They are there simply because we don’t want to consider whether a curve bends to the right or to the left (whether is increasing or decreasing), but just how fast it bends.  Also note, for later reference, that   A good test of the value of a new definition is whether or not it produces the same results that earlier, more intuitive musings that led us to. It should be clear that with this definition, the curvature of a straight line would still be zero. (Why?)              Use the following sketch of a quarter-circle with radius to show that Definition yields a curvature of .     In problem it was helpful to know that the line tangent to a circle is always perpendicular to its radius. But for an arbitrary curve this is not necessarily true. Let s look at the general situation.  First recall from equation that . Rewrite this as and differentiate so that  Dividing both sides of by we have, Next we uncancel a  or                Use equation to show that      .}     DIGRESSION: Hic Sunt Dracones (Here Be Dragons)  The time has come for us to begin understanding why differentials were abandoned as a foundational concept for Calculus. We are entering dangerous and uncharted waters but we won t dive into the deep part just yet. We'll only wade in a little way.  To indicate dangerous and uncharted waters on their maps medieval mapmakers would fill in the unexplored regions of their maps with illustrations of dragons and other mythological beasts. The Lennox Globe, in the Rare Book Division of the The New York Public Library (1510 CE), even has the inscription Hic Sunt Dracones (Here Be Dragons) along the eastern Asian coast.    The Lennox Globe           The concept of the differential of a differential, like or , is a mathematical dragon of sorts. We will proceed carefully.  If the entire development from equation to equation feels contrived, it s because it is contrived. In particular the uncancelling step is clearly a trick in the sense that nothing we did before that step seems to motivate the uncancelling. We just pulled it out of the air, and it worked. Clearly we knew that it would work, but why do you suppose we used a trick rather than explaining what we were doing?  Since everything we did hinged on the observation that (from equation and equation ) it would seem more natural to simply apply the Quotient Rule to , wouldn t it?  Let s try that and see what happens. First we get    Comment  Note this very carefully: This is because is the square of whereas is the second difference of .   Next we simplify the notation a bit. Let and so that,   But the expressions and are a problem because to get equation when we are finished we need to have , but , which seems inconsistent. Why would be something, but be nothing? This is very troubling.  We have observed regularly beginning in Chapter that the concept of a differentials is questionable. But if differentials are problematic, second differentials -- differentials of differentials -- are even moreso, if that is possible.  But the problem here is conceptual, not computational. That is, there is no computation we can do to see that the value of must be zero. Rather, we need to think carefully about the meanings of our symbols.     Leibniz Conception  When we use Leibniz differential notation we think of and as infinitesimal increments in the and coordinates. Specifically, where and are infinitely close together. This is already a difficult thing to accept.  But if we stick with Leibniz then it must be that , right? We can write this down and we can read these symbols easily enough. But what they seem to mean is that is the infinitely small difference of two infinitely small differences. So does that mean that just another differential? Or is smaller than ? But is infinitely small so how could be smaller than that?  Down that path be dragons. We won t go there.    Newton s Conception  Instead we ll adopt Newton's viewpoint and hope that it gives us a meaningful interpretation of our symbols.  For Newton, time was the only variable, and time always flows forward at a constant rate. He thought of a variable, for example, as moving, or flowing ( fluent ) in time and was the rate of flow ( fluxion ) of the fluent  . In the simplest example, if is the position of a point then is its velocity.  Newton only applied his dot notation to something that was changing in time; something that has a rate of change with respect to time. Can we apply it to time itself?  Sure we can. Time itself is changing in time , isn t it? Time flows at a rate of second per second, or one day per day, or one century per century. The units don t really matter. Loosely speaking (and mixing the Newtonian and Leibnizian viewpoints a bit), an increment of time now has the same magnitude as an increment of time later, has the same magnitude as an increment of time in the past. That is, every increment of is the same size. If we let represent elapsed time then this means that the infinitesimal increment is constant, so the fluxion of is zero: . However, keep in mind that this is not true of a quantity that is flowing at a variable rate. For example, if then whereas .  This solves our problem. If is constant then by the Constant Rule   Moreover we always have the option of adopting Newton s convention that the only independent variable is time so that when we write we are thinking of the independent variable as time (although we rarely say so out loud), and we are thinking of as functionally dependent on time (represented by in this case). Therefore      As a practical matter we will rarely be interested in second order differentials like or . As we indicated in Section the notion of a differential is really just an aid to computation, a convenient fiction. Differentials are a helpful aid but the more important and useful concept is the derivative. Differentials only serve as a step along the way to finding derivatives.  On the other hand, we will be very interested in second order derivatives: because these often represent a real, physical quantity like force or acceleration.  But now there is another difficulty that can t be ignored. In order to make sense of the expression we had to abandon Leibniz conception altogether. It is nice that Newton's viewpoint gives us a way to make sense of the notation but what this tells us is that taking either viewpoint (Newton s or Leibniz') does not get us to the logical heart of the matter. A viewpoint is just a manner of thinking. We adopt a viewpoint in order to build intuition.  When two viewpoints are at odds it means that we need something deeper and more general. In this case we need a theory that subsumes, and can replace, the views of both Leibniz and Newton. This issue must, eventually, be addressed. But for now we will continue to work intuitively. When we are done, when we stand at the top of the Calculus mountain we will be able to see the paths that Newton and Leibniz each took to get to the top. We will begin our own trek to the summit in Chapter .  END OF DIGRESSION   Since the equation of a straight line is it is clear that formula recovers Oresmer s assertion that the curvature of a straight line must be zero. (Why?)   Let s apply formula to a circle to see if this agrees with Oresme s definition of the curvature of a circle. Consider the circle of radius given by the graph of . Differentiate to obtain so that Differentiate both sides again to see that or, after dividing both sides by      Use the values for and we just computed to show that for a circle of radius , the curvature .   As we said earlier, the curvature of a general curve need not be constant, but we can still apply formula .        Show that the curvature of the parabola is given by .    Where does the greatest curvature occur? Does this agree with what you can see on the graph of ?              Consider the ellipse given by , .      Show that the curvature is given by .   Rewrite as .    Looking at this graph it appears that the curvature at should be greater than at . Use the formula you just derived to verify this.    A circle is the special case of an ellipse when . Use the formula from part to compute the curvature of a circle.                      Recall that in of we used Descartes Method of Normals to find the line tangent to the graph of at the point by finding a circle with its center on the -axis which touches the graph exactly once, as seen in the sketch below.      Compute the curvatures of the parabola and the circle seen in the diagram at the right at their point of intersection to show that they are not the same.    Find the equation of the circle which passes through the point , and also has the same slope and curvature as at the point . This is known as the osculating circle , or kissing circle .    Show that the center of the osculating circle is on the line which passes through and .                        We observed earlier that if we define curvature using equation then the curvature of a straight line will be zero as Oresme said it should be. The converse is also true. Specifically, if then must be a constant and so must also be a constant. (For simplicity we ll ignore the case where .)   Assume that and that is constant. Complete the line of reasoning we began in the previous paragraph to show that for some number . Explain how you know that this is this the equation of a line.    Comment  Circles and lines are the only curves in the plane with constant curvature. But there are many different kinds of curves in three-dimensional space with constant curvature.   We ve also shown that the curvature of a circle is also constant. Specifically, it is the reciprocal of the circle s radius. The converse of this is also true. This can be shown in much the same manner as the straight line (see equation ) but, naturally, the computations are more complex.            To see this recall . If we suppose that then we see that and that         Complete the line of reasoning we began in the previous paragraph to show that and .    Next show that for some constants and .    And finally, show that the point lies on a circle of radius . What is the equation of the circle?                    "

  "body": " Approximation Methods     Although this may seem a paradox, all exact science is dominated by the idea of approximation. When a man tells you that he knows the exact truth about anything, you are safe in inferring that he is an inexact man. Every careful measurement in science is always given with the probable error . . . every observer admits that he is likely wrong, and knows about how much wrong he is likely to be.   Bertrand Russell (1872 1970)     I think that it is a relatively good approximation to truth—which is much too complicated to allow anything but approximations—that mathematical ideas originate in empirics.   John von Neumann (1903-1957)    In a world where you can take your phone out of your pocket, ask  it for the square root of two ( ) or the fifth root of seven ( ), and instantly obtain those numbers, accurate to nine decimal places it is difficult to convey the profound importance of having good methods of approximation. With this level of accuracy available to us there appears to be no need for approximations.  But stop and think about this for a moment. Both and are irrational numbers so neither can be completely represented by a terminating decimal. That is, the decimal form of both numbers is infinitely long. So if all we have is a value accurate to only nine decimal places what we really have is an approximation, right? It s not even a particularly good approximation in the sense that most of the information we need to completely specify or in decimal form is missing.  The fact is that the modern world could not exist without good approximation methods because very little of the information necessary to functioning in the modern world can be computed precisely. Moreover in those cases where it can be computed precisely the exact number is often less useful than the approximation. For example, if you are driving to Cincinnati your GPS will tell you that you are hours and minutes away, not minutes away, even if the latter number is exactly correct.  Based on the very noisy audio signal it receives your phone constantly approximates what signal to send to the speaker for you to hear. Because signal processing is such a ubiquitous problem, many very sophisticated approximation techniques have been developed and they are used all of the time. We don t see them because they are usually embedded in software on our many electronic devices. Because they are so accurate, we tend not to see them as approximations.  Yet, every scientific, engineering, or financial computation involves approximations because it is almost always impossible to get perfect information. We must approximate and we do it all of the time. Well, actually most of the time our technology does it for us. But our technology is simply the realization of ideas that begin with paper, pencil, and thought. Without these no new technology is possible.   Ok, paper and pencil are not strictly necessary either because more modern technology is rapidly replacing even that. But the need for thought and a way to record our thoughts will never change.   After the invention of Calculus and especially in the twentieth century the number of very good approximation techniques ballooned. We will look, very briefly, at two pre-Calculus methods of approximation. Then we will consider two early approximation methods that came from Calculus: Newton s Method and Euler s Method.    Root Finding: Two Pre-Calculus Approaches       The Bisection Method  The Bisection Method is what nearly everyone would think of first when faced with an approximation problem. It sounds very complicated when written out in words and symbols, as we re about to do, but it is really quite simple. It will help if you do the computations along with us, rather than just reading them.   For the sake of having a definite problem to work with suppose we want to compute a decimal approximation to . The Bisection Method works like this: First pick two numbers, one less than , and one greater than , In this example we ll choose and .  Next, we take the midpoint of the interval as our first approximation to . We ll call this . The midpoint is the average of the endpoints so in this example . Since and are both in the bracketing interval we see that the distance between and is less than , the length of the interval.  Now must either be in the interval or . We need to decide which one. Since we see that so that must be in the interval .  We take our next approximation to be the midpoint of the (smaller) interval . Thus, . Since (confirm this) we have bracketed by   This is really the whole idea. If we are approximating a number, , we begin by bracketing between two known numbers, say and . We take the average of these, , as our first approximation of . We know that is within (the length of the interval ) of . If this is sufficiently accurate we use as our approximation.  If not we determine if is in the first half-interval, or the second, , and repeat the process, finding a new approximation in an interval half the length of the first..  The Bisection Method generates a sequence of approximations, of the root we seek. In our example we have and so on. At each step the new approximation is the midpoint of an interval whose length is one-half of the length of the previous interval. So our approximations can be made as close to the target as we would like.         Show that the next two iterations for this example are and .    The starting interval matters.   For this example take the initial interval to be and compute and .    Now take the initial interval to be and compute and .   If you had to do these computations with paper and pencil would you use , , or as your starting interval? Explain                            Although we couched it as a purely arithmetic computation, when we compute it should be clear that we found the positive root of the function In fact the Bisection Method can be used to find the roots of any continuous function.    Notice that for each of the functions below . Find the largest positive integer such that . This says that a positive root for the function lies in the interval . Use the Bisection Method to compute the next four approximations, and .                                                  The Bisection Method is simple, very general, and it always works. But, even in ideal circumstances, it is not an efficient algorithm. Despite all of our high-speed computational technology this is a drawback. We d like something more efficient.    The Babylonian Method for Square Roots  As early as BC, the ancient Babylonians were using the approximation which is within of the correct value. As with much ancient mathematics we don t really know how the Babylonians obtained this kind of accuracy. However Heron of Alexandria (circa AD - AD) described a method which may be the same as the Babylonian method. The method he described is as follows.  As with the Bisection Method we begin by making a guess for We ll label our first guess as before. Just as with the Bisection Method we d like to have bracketed between two numbers. shows how to do that.   Show that if then , and that if then .   Here we will let be our guess and notice that . In light of we see that so, as before, we have somewhere in the interval . Also as before, we take the average of these two numbers to get our second approximation,   In the Bisection Method we needed to determine if this was less than or greater than . In the Babylonian algorithm it doesn t matter for will always be between and (by ). We average these together to get our third approximation,   This is the Babylonian approximation which we mentioned earlier is within of the correct value.  It s pretty remarkable that we can get such a good approximation of with so little arithmetic. If we were to apply the algorithm again, we would get an even closer approximation.   Compute . You should get an approximation within of the correct value. Do you?     Write down the Babylonian method, as described by Heron, as a step-by-step algorithm.    Choose an initial guess and then use your algorithm to compute an approximation of .    Approximate using the Babylonian method.                  Suppose you wanted to use the Babylonian algorithm to approximate and started with an initial guess of . What would happen?  Yes, we know this is is already the square root of . We re making a point. Work with us here.    What would happen in the general case for if you ever got ?               Historical Background  Not even Heron knew; look at the dates involved.   Again, no one knows how the Babylonians discovered this algorithm, but some interesting questions arise from it: What about Is there some similar algorithm that approximates cube roots? Fourth roots? Fifth? Two hundred and eighty-seventh roots?  Of course the answer to all of these questions is yes, otherwise we wouldn t have asked. But to see why we ll have to step away from the Babylonians for a bit.     Newton s Method   When Calculus came along, Newton realized that his new invention could be used to approximate solutions to equations by a particularly simple method now called, reasonably enough, Newton s Method.   Historical Background  This is sometimes also called the Newton-Raphson Method. Joseph Raphson (1668 1712) was a younger contemporary of Newton who apparently invented this method independently.     The Idea Behind Newton s Method  We will use Newton s Method to re-invent the Babylonian square root algorithm and, more importantly, to generalize it. Here s the essential idea: We know how to find the root of a linear equation like . We want to use this knowledge to approximate the root of a nonlinear equation. As with the rest of Calculus this means that the Principle of Local Linearity is the postulate underlying Newton s Method.  For our purposes this means that we can approximate the coordinates of points on a curve with the coordinates of points on the line tangent to the curve when the the point of tangency is nearby. Moreover this approximation gets better as we get closer to the point of tangency.  Before we return the the square root problem we consider the problem of approximation more broadly.              Most mathematical software will accept the equation , whose graph is shown below, as input and give back the approximate solution at the click of a button. As a result it is easy to get the impression that this is a a simple problem. But, imagine yourself back in the late th century for a moment. The only computation technology available is paper and pencil. How would you solve this problem? How would you even generate an approximate solution?  One possibility is to graph and on the same set of axes and look for the value of where the two graphs intersect as in the figure below.   This seems like a good idea until we actually try it. Immediately we realize that accurately graphing even simple equations would have been an almost insurmountable task in those days. We clearly used modern technology to draw the graph pictured. Drawing it by hand accurately enough to glean useful information from it would have been virtually impossible.  Here s another idea. If we rearrange the equation just a little we get Now define to be the expression on the left of equation ): . The graph of this function, seen below, will cross the -axis (that is ) at the same coordinate where the equation is satisfied. This simple observation allows us to think of the problem in a slightly different way: We are looking for the value which is a root of the function .              You wouldn t think such a simple change would help. But it does because now, instead of looking for both the and coordinates of an intersection point we need only search for the value of where the graph of the function crosses the axis. This gives us just a little more information because we know that the coordinate is zero if a point is on the -axis.  As before we will need an initial guess to get started. Since the root seems to be close to the point where we ll use as our first approximation. Now find and sketch the line tangent to at as seen in the sketch above (in red). If our first guess is close enough to the actual root the Principle of Local Linearity guarantees that the tangent line will cross the -axis very near to the actual root. So the value of , whatever it is, where the tangent line crosses seems like it would be a pretty good second approximation , of the root of . If we zoom in on this part of our graph, as in the figure, this is easy to see.  Apparently all we have to do now is determine the slope of the line tangent to the graph at , then find the equation of the line and its -intercept.     Show that in this example an equation of the line tangent to at is     Our second approximation ( ) to the root we seek will be the coordinate of the point where the line in part crosses the axis. That is, where Set and show that the line in equation crosses the axis at .                    The approximation we found in is better than our original guess of , but it is still not great since , whereas if we d found the actual root, , we d have   But we don t have to stop there, and the pattern should be clear. If we wanted a more accurate approximation we could use to generate an and so on. We stop when our approximation is accurate enough for our purposes.       Find the equation of the line tangent to the function at and use this to show that our third approximation to the root of is .    Repeat part using the line tangent at to obtain the next approximation , but this time round it off to decimal places. (You will need digits for part .    If you ve done it correctly, you will notice that . Does this surprise to you? Explain.    Use your favorite computational software to find an approximation to the root of to decimal places. Compare your to this approximation. How close did you come?                                 When computing approximations our goal is to compute good approximations efficiently, not to do a lot of arithmetic. We d actually like to avoid doing arithmetic as much as possible. So it will be worth the effort needed to organize our computations as much as we can. Fortunately this is not hard to do.  In the diagram at the right we see the graph of a generic function . Suppose we have used Newton s Method repeatedly and found the th approximation, , of the the root (the th iterate). We d like to find a formula to compute the next iterate, , without having to draw the sketch and solve a new equation. leads you through this process.        Find the equation of the line tangent to the curve at the point . Show that it can be written in the form     Use your answer to part to show that is the general formula for Newton s Method.    If we get lucky and is the actual root of the function (not just an approximation). Explain what happens at the next iteration if is not the root.    In we introduced Lagrange s prime notation for the derivative: If then . We also commented that when the differential form becomes cumbersome we would switch to Lagrange s notation. Such a time has come.  Lagrange had conceptual reasons for this change in notation, but we just want to streamline our notation a bit. Since we will be looking at tangent lines to curves it will be easier on the eyes to write than We still prefer differential notation seen in Equation for most purposes so in the next chapter we will switch back to it, but the prime notation used in Equation is a little smoother for our present purpose.  We summarize the foregoing succinctly as follows:   Newton s Method  Algorithms Newton s Method  Given a differentiable function, with a root at we can approximate as follows.   Choose     For compute until the desired level of accuracy is obtained.      One reason for writing down Newton s Method in this compact form is that this makes it easier to program into a computer.  As intimidating as the general formula might first appear, remember that ultimately we are simply constructing and solving a single linear equation. This is clear from the derivation of the formula. The apparent complexity appears only because we have arranged to construct and solve the equation in a single step.  Newton s Method works because the property of being the root of a function is a local, not a global property. If our approximation, is quite close to the root we seek then we can safely assume\\aside{Most of the time. See the discussion below.} that the curve and its tangent line are practically the same. This is, of course, the Principle of Local Linearity again.  At the end of step we used the phrase until the desired level of accuracy is obtained. Clearly we are being cagey. How can we tell when we have an estimate which is accurate to any level of precision, let alone the desired level? This is a harder question than it probably appears to be. For that reason we will not be looking into it very deeply. For our purposes it will be good enough to assume that if the first four digits to the right of the decimal have not changed from one iteration to the next then our estimate is accurate to four decimal places.   Obviously, has a root at But if we want to compute this is not a good choice of function to apply Newton s Method to. Explain why not. What would be a good choice for if we wish to approximate ?     Create a function which has a root at each of the following numbers and use your function to compute each to decimals using Newton s Method.                                                  Start with and use Newton s Method to compute the next four approximations ( , , , and ) of the roots of each of the following functions. Compare these with your results in . Which algorithm seems to be more accurate after four iterations?                                                    Use Newton s Method to approximate the root of each of the following functions to at least four decimal places on the interval given.     on      on      on                             As you can see from the sketch above, the graphs of and intersect exactly once. We want to use Newton s Method to find an approximation of the coordinates of the point of intersection.  First obtain the iteration formula: Then use this formula to approximate the coordinates of the point of intersection to decimal places.     Find the Pattern      Apply Newton s Method to the function , shown above, to determine the iteration formula for approximating . Show that this is precisely the st iteration you get when using the Babylonian method:     Use Newton s Method on the function to obtain the iteration formula: for approximating . Notice that is the average of , and .    Obtain the iteration scheme for approximating the fourth root of Is this also an average? Of what?    Now find an iteration scheme to find the th root of if is a positive number, and is a positive integer.                                            If the initial guess is reasonably close to the root Newton s Method finds a very accurate approximation to the root of a function in just a few iterations most of the time. This made it extremely useful in the th century when such computations were done by hand. Indeed, it computes the square root of a number pretty quickly even if the initial guess is very bad. For example in the graph at the right the blue curve is the graph of We start with an initial guess of (obviously a terrible guess) and find the intercept of the red tangent line to find the next guess, which is better but still terrible. Repeating we generate the green tangent line at which crosses the axis at Finally we generate the orange tangent line at which crosses the axis at which is correct to one decimal. If we continue one more iteration (not shown) we get which is correct to three decimals.  But this paper-and-pencil procedure is not as simple as handing the problem off to your favorite computational software so a natural question to ask is, Why bother? why should we learn this?   The answer is that whatever software you end up using will be performing either the computations above or something very like them. And these Numerical Methods are not 100% reliable.  However if you are familiar with the limitations of the algorithm(s) being used you will also be aware of the limitations of your software. Perhaps more importantly, you are less likely to believe a wrong answer when you get it. Depending on what you are computing an incorrect approximation could mean anything from a minor annoyance -- if you are calculating just for fun to a deadly disaster if you are designing a control procedure for a self-driving car.    Even if you don t have any intuition into the problem a more than cursory understanding of the algorithm itself can be helpful. For example, show that when Newton s Method is used:    If and have the same sign then .    If and have opposite signs then .    Suppose you are trying to compute a numerical approximation of using an implementation of Newton s Method, but you accidentally enter as your function (instead of ). Explain how you can use the results of part and part to see that the algorithm is failing at the third iteration.                     So, how do you know if you should trust the approximation you get back from your favorite software? First, be aware of what a reasonable answer should be. In it is clear that the root must be positive. If software tries to tell you that it is equal to you know it is lying. Second be aware of the ways that an approximation method might fail.  For example, Newton s Method is not perfect. It can fail in two distinct ways: Subtle and Spectacular. Let s take a look at them.    Spectacular Failure  Newton s Method can fail spectacularly in two distinct, but related, ways. The first is very easy to spot.    Suppose we want to find the root of and our initial guess is . Investigate, both algebraically and graphically, what happens when we apply Newton s Method to this problem. Describe the results of your investigations.    Because Newton s Method requires that we divide by we will get an error if it happens that . We call this a spectacular failure because it is easy to spot whether we do the computation with a computer or with paper and pencil. Indeed, modern computer software is very adept at alerting us to division by zero errors.  The second kind of spectacular failure is exemplified by the following problem.    The only root of the function is zero.    Use Newton s Method with the initial guess, to see if it converges to zero.   It won t.    Write down a formula for the computation in step from Newton s Method for this function. Use this to explain why the method will not converge no matter what non-zero initial guess is used.                Obviously we don t need to use Newton s Method to compute the root of The point of this example is that Newton s Method will not find the root no matter how close our initial guess is. Instead it will continue to generate alternately positive and negative approximations to zero, that are farther and farther from zero.    Subtle Failure  The other way Newton s Method fails can be quite subtle. That is, it can converge, but not to the number we seek. The best way to demonstrate this is with an example.   Suppose we wish to compute by finding the smallest positive root of If we start with an initial guess of (not a great first guess, but it s not obviously horrible either) we get which certainly seems like it might be a problem since If we ignore this and continue we get and              What s going on here? The numbers seem to be converging, but they are not converging to the answer we intended to find. The figure below shows what the difficulty is.   In a nutshell, our initial guess was too far away from the root. The slope of the tangent line at is which means that the tangent line (in red) decreases from left to right, but also that its slope is very shallow. Thus the tangent line crosses the axis at about very far from the root we seek. Now it happens that is actually pretty close to another root of our function: So continued iterations of Newton s Method will settle in on the root at . But the damage has already been done. We ve found a legitimate root but not he one we intended to find.  We call this a subtle failure because Newton s Method will converge without complaint. None of the computations will seem suspicious. A software implementation of Newton s Method for this problem using this initial guess will return a reasonable looking, but wrong, number. Although it is glaringly obvious what goes wrong when we draw a picture of each successive approximation the fact is if we use a software to compute the root most of the time there would be no pictures. Notice that, unlike the spectacular failure above there is nothing in the calculations being performed that could be detected in software to let the human in charge know that things have gone wrong. So, if you rely on software it is essential that you take the time to consider the reasonableness of the answer you obtain. If this is not understood there is a real risk that you could accept a ridiculous answer as correct.   Comment  This is embarrassing at best, deadly at worst. Seriously. If what you are calculating is the embedded software for, say the autopilot system, of an airliner accepting the wrong answer midflight could easily be deadly. Don t take this lightly.    The problem of converging to a wrong answer is particularly acute when a function has two roots which are very close together, for example if     Find approximations to all real roots of     From the previous examples it should be clear that it is important that the initial guess be sufficiently close to the root we seek that the iterations will converge to the desired root. This, of course, begs the question, How close should our initial guess be? This is actually a hard question. Since we don t yet possess all of the knowledge and skills needed we can t answer it in any definite way. So we ll just say that in general your initial guess should be as close as you can make it.  But take care. As we saw in sometimes even having a very accurate first guess is not sufficient.        Use Newton s Method to find approximations to the positive roots closest to zero of each of the following functions. (Clearly you can use Algebra and Trigonometry to compute them exactly. The point here is to see how good our guesses must sometimes be in order for Newton s Method to work.}                          If we were to next ask you to find approximations of the negative roots closest to zero of each of these functions would you need to use Newton s Method again? Explain.                                        Do not try to answer the questions in this problem analytically. Use a graphing calculator, or graphing software to explore these questions visually. The function has exactly one real root and it is between one and two.    Show that with an initial guess, , Newton s Method almost never converges to the root.    We said almost never in part because there is a small interval of numbers greater than with the property that Newton s Method will converge if is any number in the interval. Find an interval that works. (It doesn t have to be the largest possible interval.)    Show that if you start with an initial guess of or Newton s Method will not even generate the first iterate: Explain.                            Suppose that a cubic polynomial has three real roots, , , and and that two of them, and are known. We wish to approximate the third. Show that if we take the average of and as our initial guess, Newton s Method will find the exact value of the third root, , in one iteration.       Euler s Method              Suppose is a point on the graph of an unknown function (in green in the figure above). Suppose further that if the line tangent to the graph at (in red) crosses the -axis at as shown.  We wish to address the following question: Is there a curve which passes through the point with the property that the distance from to is equal to regardless of the location of on the graph.    Historical Background  The line segment is called the subtangent of the graph. In the seventeenth century mathematics was still strongly tied to Greek geometry so some of the early, pre-Calculus efforts to find the tangent lines were aimed at finding the length of the subtangent of a curve. Finding length of is equivalent to finding the derivative of at because if and are known then the slope of the curve at is equal to .   At form the differential right triangle with the infinitesimal vertical displacement and the infinitesimal horizontal displacement , as shown. Then the right triangle with sides of length and is proportional to the differential triangle. By the properties of proportional triangles this curve must satisfy the differential equation: .  Since we specified that the curve must pass through the point we see that we need to find a function that satisfies the following two conditions: A problem like the one stated in Formula is called an Initial Value Problem , or IVP. We will give a formal definition below ( Definition ).  We do not know a formula for which will satisfy IVP , nor do we have the tools to find such a formula, yet. We will return to this question in ) where we will solve IVP ) exactly. For the moment we will be satisfied if we can find an approximate graph of the solution. That will give us a general sense of its shape.  The initial value in IVP ) shows that the curve passes through the point . From the differential equation in IVP ) we see that which means that the curve passes through the point with a slope equal to . So the equation of the line tangent to our curve is This is not a lot to work with, but let s not set our sights too high.  By the Principle of Local Linearity, the line tangent to the curve and the curve itself are going to be nearly indistinguishable near to the point . Moreover, we can find any point on the tangent line since we have its equation. If we increment the -coordinate just a little bit while staying on the tangent line then the corresponding coordinate on the tangent line will be close to the coordinate on the curve. So we can use the -coordinate on the tangent line (which we know) to approximate the -coordinate on the curve (which we don t know).             Let s say we increase by so that . The -coordinate on the line tangent to the curve at is (since the equation of our tangent line is ).  We now have two points on our curve: and The point isn t on the curve, but it s close. Remember we re only trying to approximate the curve. Connecting these with a straight line we have the red segment on the graph above. So far, so good.  Next we increment by again, to . We would really like to have the equation of the line tangent to the curve at but we simply have no way to obtain it. All we have is the point . But we know that so the differential equation from IVP ) tells us that also. Thus we see that the curve will pass (approximately) through the point with slope (approximately) equal to . Therefore the equation of the line tangent to the curve at (approximately) will be and as long as we don t move too far the Principle of Local Linearity guarantees that this line and the curve we seek are close together. So we use the blue line segment from to in our figure above to approximate the curve on the interval .  We now repeat this process to compute the points: , , , and so on. Plotting these points and connecting them with straight line segments gives us the rest of the sketch above.            At each step we use the previous approximation to compute the next, so it would be miraculous if we actually found exactly the points on the graph of our curve. But it should be clear that the curve we ve drawn will at least resemble the desired curve, as long as we don t stray too far from our initial point . The sketch below shows our approximation and the actual solution on the same set of axes.   Comment  In practice of course, we wouldn t know the actual solution if we knew that there would be no reason to find an approximation but in this case we (the authors) do know.    The solution of this particular IVP turns out to be incredibly useful in mathematics, theoretical physics, engineering, and science and technology in general. We will be revisiting it in the next chapter.  The procedure we have just outlined is known as Euler s Method ; named for the great eighteenth century mathematician Leonhard Euler. For now we ll focus on how to use Euler s Method to find an approximate solution of an arbitrary Initial Value Problem .  We define an Initial Value Problem formally as follows.   Initial Value Problem (IVP)    An Initial Value Problem is a differential equation of the form along with an Initial Value      Don t let the formalism of this definition scare you. All it says is that at every point the slope of , , is given by some formula, , which may involve both and and that we know the value of for a single value of . Specifically, at .   Comment  In our problem above we had .   To write down Euler s Method clearly we will need some notation. We know that the equation of the tangent line to the curve at the point is given by So if we choose very close to and compute then would be approximately on the curve. In this way we can generate a sequence of points which are approximately on the curve. Connecting them with straight line segments should provide an approximate graph of the curve.  Formalizing all of this we have:   Euler s Method  Algorithms Euler s Method  Given an IVP: approximate points on the graph of by computing:    At each iteration the value of has been approximated, so the next approximation is probably not as good. Thus, as we move further from our initial value our approximation probably deviates further away from the actual curve. However, near to the initial value, we should have a reasonable approximation to the curve . The next two problems demonstrate this.    Observe that satisfies the IVP Use Euler s Method on this IVP to complete the table. Then plot the points you generated and the graph of on the same set of axes so you can compare them.                              Observe that satisfies the IVP Use Euler s Method on this IVP to complete the following table. Then plot the points you generated and the graph of on the same set of axes so you can compare them.                              Use Euler s Method to approximate the solutions of the given IVPs by constructing a table like the ones in Problems  and . Then plot the points you found, connecting them with straight line segments.

Then plot the points you found, connecting them with straight line segments.

Then plot the points you found, connecting them with straight line segments.                                                                            Consider the top view of a tractor-trailer as it turns, as shown at the right. Initially, the center of the rear axle of the tractor is at the origin and the center of the rear axle of the trailer is at the point . The tractor pulls the front wheels vertically up the -axis and we assume that the rear wheels don t slip. The path that the center of the rear axle follows is called a tractrix from the Latin verb trahere , meaning to drag or pull.     Show that the tractrix must satisfy the Initial Value Problem    Find a differential triangle and an ordinary triangle which are proportional.    Apply Euler s Method to complete the following table to approximate the tractrix.                            Plot the points obtained in part b to see if this looks like the path the rear axle of the trailer would take.       This figure needs a caption.          Suppose a rocket travels up the line at a constant speed . As the rocket passes through the point , a missile is fired from the origin directly at the rocket. Assume that the missile travels at a speed which is times the speed of the rocket and is always aimed directly at the rocket. At time the missile is at the point and the rocket is at the point We want to find the path the missile will follow. The diagram at the right shows the situation at time .    Find if denotes the length of the the missile s path at time .    Show that the missile s path must satisfy the IVP    Find a triangle which is proportional to the differential triangle shown.}    Apply Euler s Method to fill in the following table.                            Plot the points obtained in part b to see if this resembles the path you think the missile would follow.  We will re-visit this problem and find the exact solution in .                                       Higher Derivatives, Lagrange, and Taylor             In the diagram below we see a pendulum of length with an object of mass at the end. If the object is moved away from its equilibrium point the pendulum will begin to swing back and forth. If we disregard friction the angle , that the pendulum forms with a vertical line would oscillate in a manner very like the motion of the Simple Harmonic Oscillators (SHO) that we saw in Section .   If the motion of the pendulum actually is an SHO then it will necessarily satisfy Equation . In this case that means that for some constant value of . We ll investigate to see if that is true.  To keep our model simple we assume that and we will ignore any sort of resistance. The only force we are considering is the (vertical) force due to gravity . As before this vertical force will resolve into the centripetal force along the length of the pendulum, and the tangential force in the direction of motion. We will focus our attention on the tangential force.  If is measured in radians then the length of the arc traced by the object is . Thus we see that the tangential component of the force due to gravity is given by as shown. Notice that when this tangential force points to the left and when it points to the right (not shown). This says that the sign of the tangential force is the opposite of the sign of . When is in the interval  and have the same sign. Thus We have . Using Newton s Second Law, , we see that the motion of a pendulum satisfies the equation Finally, since we have . Using the Constant Rule (twice) we see that . Thus But it does not satisfy equation ). Therefore a swinging pendulum is not a Simple Harmonic Oscillator. Its motion is slightly more complex.             But only slightly.   By examining the graphs of and we can see the that for values of close to zero the graphs are nearly identical. Thus, when the angle is very small and are very nearly equal. In that case if we replace with in equation we see the the motion of a pendulum approximately satisfies the equation which we recognize as equation with    Show that the equation of the line tangent to at is .              Approximating by its tangent line at works well for values of close to zero. We have not been very precise about the meaning of close to zero but it should be clear that if is too large equation will no longer serve as a good model.  Notice that the function is a first degree polynomial. Is it possible that a polynomial with a higher degree will give us a better approximation? Can we find a polynomial with degree greater than one that approximates the graph of ?  At the left we compare the graphs of (in red), (in blue), and (in green) on the same set of axes. It should be clear is a better approximation to than in the sense that the graph of stays closer to the graph of on a wider interval than the graph of .  So it seems reasonable to suppose that the differential equation if we can solve it, would serve as a better model for the motion of a pendulum than equation . Unfortunately we do not yet have the tools to solve equation , but the notion of approximating a complex function, like , with a polynomial will turn out to be very useful so we will explore it for a bit before we go on. We will again switch to Lagrange s prime notation because in this context Lagrange s notation really shines. Indeed, it was while he was looking at similar problems that Lagrange invented his prime notation in the first place.  The key is to look at higher derivatives of . Recall that for , Lagrange introduced the notation and terminology    Show that the equation of the line tangent to the graph of an arbitrary (differentiable) function at is given by    Applying the result of Drill to we see that the equation of the line tangent to the graph of at is given by    This drill demonstrates how we can obtain a first degree polynomial that approximates near . Suppose that is some (differentiable) function and that .   Show that if then    Show that if then               Next, suppose we want to find a second-degree (quadratic) polynomial, , for which , and . It is clear that we can simply extend what we did in the previous problem. That is, we start with a generic second-degree polynomial, .  First we insist that . Evaluating both functions at gives so .  To obtain , differentiate both functions and insist that the first two derivatives of and match at . That is, So .        Differentiate again and set the second derivatives at equal to one another to show that     Show that if the cubic has the same third derivative as at then     Show that if the quartic has the same fourth derivative as at then                        It seems clear that we could use this procedure in a machine-like way to produce a polynomial approximation of any degree. In fact, this machine for producing approximating polynomials was known long before Lagrange, but he made it more tractable by replacing differentials and differential notation, which are very cumbersome to use here, with derivatives and his prime notation. In general this approximating polynomial is called a Taylor Polynomial named after the English mathematician Brook Taylor ( ), but was known to mathematiciasn before Taylor (including Newton and Leibniz).    This is the process we used to generate our cubic approximation to the sine function just before equation .    Show that using this process on will generate the polynomial that we showed you earlier: .

Would it make any sense to use the fifth-degree Taylor Polynomial in this case? Explain.    In general the Taylor Polynomial, of degree , that approximates a differentiable function is given by:   As you might imagine Taylor Polynomials are incredibly useful approximation tools. At this point we have given you only the most basic of introductions. You will see this again in much more depth in the next course, Integral Calculus.   "

As a result it is easy to get the impression that this is a a simple problem. But, imagine yourself back in the late th century for a moment. The only computation technology available is paper and pencil. How would you solve this problem? How would you even generate an approximate solution?  One possibility is to graph and on the same set of axes and look for the value of where the two graphs intersect as in the figure below.   This seems like a good idea until we actually try it. Immediately we realize that accurately graphing even simple equations would have been an almost insurmountable task in those days. We clearly used modern technology to draw the graph pictured. Drawing it by hand accurately enough to glean useful information from it would have been virtually impossible.  Here s another idea. If we rearrange the equation just a little we get Now define to be the expression on the left of equation ): . The graph of this function, seen below, will cross the -axis (that is ) at the same coordinate where the equation is satisfied. This simple observation allows us to think of the problem in a slightly different way: We are looking for the value which is a root of the function .              You wouldn t think such a simple change would help. But it does because now, instead of looking for both the and coordinates of an intersection point we need only search for the value of where the graph of the function crosses the axis. This gives us just a little more information because we know that the coordinate is zero if a point is on the -axis.  As before we will need an initial guess to get started. Since the root seems to be close to the point where we ll use as our first approximation. Now find and sketch the line tangent to at as seen in the sketch above (in red). If our first guess is close enough to the actual root the Principle of Local Linearity guarantees that the tangent line will cross the -axis very near to the actual root. So the value of , whatever it is, where the tangent line crosses seems like it would be a pretty good second approximation , of the root of . If we zoom in on this part of our graph, as in the figure, this is easy to see.  Apparently all we have to do now is determine the slope of the line tangent to the graph at , then find the equation of the line and its -intercept.  "

The numbers seem to be converging, but they are not converging to the answer we intended to find. The figure below shows what the difficulty is.   In a nutshell, our initial guess was too far away from the root. The slope of the tangent line at is which means that the tangent line (in red) decreases from left to right, but also that its slope is very shallow. Thus the tangent line crosses the axis at about very far from the root we seek. Now it happens that is actually pretty close to another root of our function: So continued iterations of Newton s Method will settle in on the root at . But the damage has already been done. We ve found a legitimate root but not he one we intended to find.  We call this a subtle failure because Newton s Method will converge without complaint. None of the computations will seem suspicious. A software implementation of Newton s Method for this problem using this initial guess will return a reasonable looking, but wrong, number. Although it is glaringly obvious what goes wrong when we draw a picture of each successive approximation the fact is if we use a software to compute the root most of the time there would be no pictures.

  "body": " Exponentials and Logarithms     The extinction of the human race will come from its inability to emotionally comprehend the exponential function.   Edward Teller (1908 2003)    You are already familiar with fourteen of the so-called elementary functions in mathematics. These are:   Polynomials:  Polynomials are functions of the form: where are constants.    Rational Functions:  The rational functions are quotients of polynomials: where are constants.    Trigonometric Functions:  There are six trigonometric functions: , , , , , and     Trigonometric Inverses:  Each of the trigonometric functions has an associated inverse: , , , , , and    Algebraically combining this basic set of fourteen functions allows us to build almost all of the functions you have encountered so far in your mathematics education. Loosely speaking what makes these elementary is that we don t need Calculus to define them.  But Calculus gives us several different ways to define a multitude of new functions. Each such function is a new tool. New tools give us the means to solve new problems, and a new way to approach old problems. This is one reason that the invention of Calculus was such an important advance.  Functions which require Calculus for their definition are (usually) called analytic functions.   Mathematical Terminology  The precise definition of analytic actually comes directly from the work we did in Section on approximating functions with polynomials. But one way or another the definition of analytic is tied to Calculus.  The exponential and logarithmic functions which we take up next occupy a middle ground between the elementary and the analytic functions. They can be defined without Calculus, which is why you re probably already familiar with them. But in some ways it is better to use Calculus. The exponential functions give us our first, fairly easy-to-understand introduction to the construction of new functions using Calculus so we will start there.     Initial Value Problems (IVPs)  Let s step back for a moment. Recall the definition of an Initial Value Problem from . An IVP consists of two parts:   The differential equation (for example, ),    The initial value. (So called because when the independent variable is time we usually know the value of our function initially.)     A common way to create new functions using Calculus is by defining the new function to be the solution(s) of a specified IVP.   We ve seen that when we differentiate the formula we get the differential equation  or If we did not already know that the function satisfies equation we could give a name to the solution (sqr , perhaps?) and by fiat, define sqr to be whatever function solves this equation. But there is a problem. The solution of equation is a multifunction, remember? To choose a single branch we need to impose an initial condition.   Solve each of the following IVPs. Graph your solutions:                                  where and are fixed, but unspecified constants.     Simply naming the function tells us nothing about it. However the IVP itself can give us a some insight into the nature of the solution. For example since when , the slope of the graph of is clearly also negative when , Similarly, the slope of the graph of is positive when .  Of course we already knew that since we have a formula for . This won t be true in the next section.    The Natural Exponential  \\TLogo{PSP:four-proof-irrat}  In exactly the same way that we can define via any of the Initial Value Problems in we can declare, by fiat, the following:   The Natural Exponential Function    The function which satisfies the IVP is called the natural exponential function , denoted .    But of course as we said earlier, simply giving the function a name does not tell us anything about it.  In Section we investigated this IVP in some detail and we were able to draw an approximate graph of the natural exponential (at least near the initial value, ). We will explore this function further here.  Recall that the Taylor Polynomial of a function, as described in , equation , given by can approximate the function well, near a given point. Since we know the value of the natural exponential at the initial value let’s try to generate the Taylor Polynomial approximation of near that point.   Mathematics Notation  Recall that the parenthetical superscript, , indicates the th derivative. Thus represents the second derivative of , represents the third derivative, and so on.   Notice that because satisfies IVP it also satisfies each of the following (why?):     Let be the th degree Taylor polynomial approximation of use equation and the initial value , to show that       Exponential Growth and Exponential Notation  It is now time to solve IVP by finding an explicit formula for .  But how? Nothing really presents itself as a potential solution so what should we do? Since we don t seem to have any better options, let s see if we can guess a solution.   DIGRESSION: The Art of Guessing Effectively  Digression The Art of Guessing Effectively  No, really. Guessing can be surprisingly effective.  You know this of course. You ve been doing it all of your life, but in the past especially in math classes guessing was probably discouraged so you tend to deny doing it, possibly even to yourself. It s OK. Guess anyway. We won t tell anyone.  The fact is that guessing is a tried and true solution technique and we encourage you to use it regularly. Guessing is nothing more, or less, than relying on your native intuition.  Effective guessing is a skill. You need practice to do it well and, unfortunately, you have probably not had much chance to practice that skill in the context of mathematics. So we encourage you to guess often from now on. But be aware that making a guess is a process, not an event. If you guess wrong, which is most likely, then you have a new, related problem to think about: All of your intuition said this was a good guess. Why didn t it work? The answer to that question almost always gives some insight into the original problem. Even a bad guess can be useful.  However a bad guess, indeed any guess, in isolation is a waste of time. You must also take the time to figure out why your bad guess doesn t work.  But the real danger in guessing the reason it is usually discouraged is that when you do guess correctly, or nearly so, it is very tempting to just move on from there. Don t do that.  Guessing correctly means that your intuition was very good. But intuition is unconscious. It is at least as important to understand where a good guess came from, and why it worked as it is to understand why a bad guess didn t work. But when you guess well it is extremely tempting to just take your good guess and run with it. This will invariably lead to confusion later. So, when you guess correctly take a few moments to think about the intuition that led you to that guess. Bring that intuition out of your unconscious mind and into your conscious mind. If you don t do that your guesses are a waste of your time.  So let s take a guess. There is no need to get really crazy about it though. We already know that the Taylor polynomial of approximates . Maybe we can find an large enough that the approximation becomes exact.    Show that none of the following is a solution of IVP . (Observe that if is a solution then .)      The notation is read three factorial and means Similarly and in general                       Show that none of the following is a solution of . (Observe that if is a solution then .)   Mathematical Notation  The notation is read three factorial and means Similarly and in general                          Notice that if then so that the difference between and is   Since the difference between and is that stupid one-millionth term which is very small it is clear that we ve almost got something here. Surely we can handle that last term somehow!  Sadly no, we can t. In fact no polynomial will solve IVP .    Show that the previous paragraph is true. That is, show that there is no (non-zero) polynomial that solves the differential equation:     Consider the degree of the polynomial and the degree of its derivative.    Since no polynomial will work a fair question is: Why have we taken you on this wild goose chase?  In fact, we almost have a solution here. One million is a very large number, so one million factorial ( is inconceivably large. Thus for any value of we re likely to encounter that one millionth term, is so incredibly close to zero that it almost isn t really there. And if it isn t really there then and its derivative are pretty much the same thing.  So we re . . . done, . . . right?  No, of course not. Although that last term really is practically zero it is not actually zero, no matter how small it is. As Newton said, In mathematics the smallest of errors must be dealt with.    Historical Background  Newton wrote his scientific works in Latin. This is a very loose translation of the phrase In rebus mathematicis erores quam minimi non sunt contemnendi. from his book Quadraturam Curvarum (On the Quadrature of Curves).   So we haven t solved our problem in the sense of having an explicit formula for . But we do know a great deal about it at this point. In particular we know that the Taylor polynomial will be a very good approximation of , at least for values of near zero.  But if there is no polynomial that solves equation does that mean there is no solution at all? Certainly not. In fact, since that last term of the polynomial seems to be the stumbling block the solution is clear: All we need to do is not have a last term.  This is a startling idea but before we dismiss it, let s take our own advice from Digression: The Art of Guessing Effectively . We ll trust our intuition, but also examine it closely. What we re saying is that the solution of equation is: where the dots at the end mean that the summation goes on forever. There is no last term.  You would expect a polynomial that doesn t end to be called an infinite polynomial but it is not. Such an expression is called an infinite series. Usually we just call it a series. A series is not a polynomial. That is, a polynomial is defined to have only finitely many terms and a series is defined to have infinitely many terms. We distinguish them from each other specifically so that we don t confuse a series with a polynomial.  An obvious question to ask is, Does this infinite series even mean anything? Or, equivalently, What does it mean to add up infinitely many numbers? These are excellent questions which will have to be addressed eventually. But for now we won t let them trouble us. We ll just assume that makes sense, in the same way we assumed that differentials make sense and defer those questions until later.    Having set aside those deeper questions (for now) we can show that we have found the solution of our IVP.    Differentiate the series term-by-term to show that .    Show that    Yes, this really is as easy as it looks.    We would be remiss if we did not mention that we have lead you up to the edge of an abyss here. It is not at all clear that the Sum Rule for differentiation can be extended to infinite sums in any meaningful manner. In fact, this is a very delicate question. Sometimes the extension is valid and sometimes it is not. This is another of the foundational questions (like What is a differential? ) that took mathematicians nearly years to resolve and understanding that resolution requires the use of considerably more subtle tools than we have at this point. You will learn more about this in the next course. For now we will assert the prerogative of the teacher and simply tell you that in this case term-by-term differentiation still works.                     The result of seems to show that we have the exact solution of IVP in the form of the infinite series, This actually is a correct solution of IVP , and eventually you will learn to work with infinite series solutions of IVPs directly. But, unfortunately, we don t yet have the tools that allow us to do that. So we will have to find another way. What now?   The sketch above shows the graph of the polynomial which we believe, from our work in Section , should be a good approximation to , at least when is near zero. When we zoom in on the part of the graph which is near we see that the following graph should be a reasonable approximation to the solution of IVP in the interval shown.     In your earlier math courses you may have seen graphs that looked like this before. If not, then consider the following graphs of the exponential functions , and and notice that they are very similar to the graph of .   This is much clearer when we graph all three functions on the same axes as seen here:     As you can plainly see near they are indeed very similar.   Since the polynomial is an approximation to the solution of IVP it appears that either of or might be a viable candidate for the solution of our IVP. Is it possible we ve had the solution in our hands all along? Let s differentiate to see if solves IVP .  If then so the initial condition is satisfied.  To check the differential equation it is tempting to assume that we can apply the Power Rule, giving us . But this can t possibly be correct because when is negative then is also negative. But the slope of is positive everywhere as you can see from its graph.  In fact, none of our differentiation rules will give us the derivative of So we will have to go back to basics and find from first principles, without using any of our Differentiation Rules.   Commnet  Our notation fails us a bit here. Recall that is a function so means evaluated at . This is not multiplication.   Let and observe that is the (infinitesimal) difference between and , or Since is equal to and we have, Thus   We want to form so we divide equation by , giving The differential in the exponent is a bit concerning. We will have to be clever.  We have become comfortable thinking of as infinitely small, but it should be clear that if we take to be a very small, but finite number, say we can use equation to approximate as accurately as we wish.  Replacing with on the right side of equation we get    Confirm equation .   This isn t bad for a first try! Do you see that we have almost satisfied the differential equation? We have when what we need is . The constant factor is a bit too small. If it were instead of we d have the solution of IVP . This is hopeful.  Performing the same calculation using we see that once again we almost have a solution: The initial condition is still satisfied and once again the differential equation part of IVP is almost satisfied. But this time the coefficient, is a bit too big.  It stands to reason that there must be some number between and with the property that satisfies IVP . For historical reasons this number, whatever it is, has been named . So the solution of IVP is    END OF DIGRESSION       We originally named this function .That is still a valid name for it, just as sqr( is a valid name for the function sqr . However, just as the formula better represents the way we usually think about the squaring function ( square the input variable , the notation better represents the way we usually think about the natural exponential function.  You should think of the natural exponential as this funny number raised to the power of the input variable. However, it is a curious fact that the modern definition of the natural exponential is not The modern definition is actually the infinite series we derived earlier:   To see why we define it this way, ask yourself what the expression means.  That s easy enough. Since clearly is the square root of this funny number : It would not necessarily be easy to compute the square root of but we re only asking about the meaning of our symbols here. Since is a positive number we can take its square root and that is what means, even if we can t compute it. In precisely the same way , and in general if and are positive integers, .  But what could the expression possibly mean? Since is not an integer it doesn t mean copies of multiplied together. Since can t be represented as ratio of integers (because it is irrational after all) it doesn t mean some root of raised to a power the way that say, means This difficulty is compounded if we ask for the meaning of or since both and are irrational.  And this is not just a matter of not knowing the value of . The difficulty is built into the real numbers. Recall that we saw the same issue come up in Section when we tried to extend the Power Rule to irrational exponents. This is weird.   Comment  Many people are repelled when they encounter this situation. Especially in mathematics. After all, mathematics is about having the answers to mathematical problems isn t it?  Well, no. Actually it isn t. You re thinking of engineering. Mathematics is about finding the answers to mathematical problems, not having them.   Even if we can t compute it we need to find a way to give meaning to the expression that works when is irrational. Ideally, we d like our interpretation to be consistent with our understanding that This is precisely why we define natural exponential as an infinite series. It can be shown (though we will not show it here) that if , and are integers with then   If there is only one solution to IVP (there is) then and must be the same solution. Defining as rather than addresses all of these issues. For example means   Of course we are still free to think of the natural exponential as , regardless of the definition and we encourage you to do that. It can be very helpful.    For this problem use the approximation     Use equation to show that . Compare this with the numerical value of you get from a calculator.   In equation take     Use equation to show that .

The function is called the natural exponential function and is its base just as is the base of the exponential function and is the base of the exponential function .   Mathematical Notation  You can decide for yourself how natural this really is. Opinions vary. But whether you decide you like this name or not it is the name everyone uses so we re stuck with it.   Of course, we only know that so far. How might we find a better approximation to ?   Since we know that solves IVP , it should be clear that we can approximate by computing the sum of, say fifty, terms of the series. Compute this approximation using your favorite computing technology to confirm that . (If you don t have any computing technology available just compute the sum of the first six terms.)   The upshot of is that if we replace with in equation , or if we replace in equation the constant the result should be closer to than if we use or , respectively.  Checking this gives   We did not get exactly because   We used an approximation of , not itself, and     is a very small, finite number, not a differential.     But the evidence is compelling that is the solution of the IVP . Henceforth then, we will reserve the letter to designate the base of the natural exponential function.  You might ask, Why not just figure out what actually is, and use that? Why use the letter ? The answer is that is an irrational number much like . Among other things this means that its decimal expansion never ends, so we use for the same reason we use .  We now have a new differentiation rule to remember. This one is particularly easy to remember: The natural exponential function is its own derivative, But just because we have a new rule, does not mean that our old differentiation rules are ignored. As always, all of the rules work together.   Find the derivative of   Using the Product Rule, we have    Compute for each of the following, and use this to find the IVP that each one solves.

Hyperbolic Trigonometry: The Hanging Chain  We commented in Section that Galileo believed erroneously that a chain hanging from two pegs falls naturally into the shape of a parabola. In Problem we showed that Galileo was wrong but we have not yet addressed the question: What is the shape of a hanging chain?  Recall that the hanging chain must satisfy the differential equation where is the weight density of the chain and is the (constant) magnitude of the horizontal tension. In Problem we will see that although the natural exponential function is not the solution itself, it is the key to the solution.   The Shape of a Hanging Chain   The Calculus in this problem is pretty straightforward but the Algebra gets a bit messy. To avoid some of this mess in part , part , and part we will solve the special case where in part we ll use our solution of this special case to solve the original problem.  So assume that . For this special case we will call our variables and , rather than and . The reasons for this will become clear in part .

Does this make sense physically? Why or why not?                                                              The expressions and arise frequently in many scientific and engineering problems and have been named the hyberbolic cosine and hyberbolic sine and are denoted and , respectively. As you see these names break with the longstanding mathematical tradition of giving important functions three letter names. Why do you suppose we would do that?   Mathematical Notation  Traditionally, is read aloud as cinch and is read aloud as, well cosh .   Recall that the unit circle, , is parameterized by since     Analogously, show that the unit hyperbola , is parameterized by That is, show that .    The obvious similarity between the formulas is not a coincidence. It also explains why they are called Hyperbolic Trigonometric Functions .  The many scientific and engineering problems that involve the hyperbolic functions are slightly outside the scope of this text. So we will only examine some of their more elementary properties in the next problem.   The Hyperbolic Trigonometric Functions   In addition to and we make the following definitions which are clearly modeled on the definitions of the trigonometric functions:           Show that                                    Show that:     Show that:     Show that:     Show that:     Compare each of the identities above with the corresponding trigonometric identity.

The Gateway Arch    The Gateway Arch in St. Louis                   When he designed the Gateway Arch in St. Louis, Missouri, architect Eero Saarinen wanted to build it in the shape of an inverted catenary. The arch would have a height of feet and a width of feet. Its cross sections would be equilateral triangles with sides feet at ground level shrinking to feet at the top. To obtain the shape of the arch, Saarinen decided that the centers of the triangular cross sections should follow the curve where .   Historical Background  For more information on the history and mathematics of the Gateway Arch, see the article by Robert Osserman How the Gateway Arch Got its Shape      A true catenary is the graph of any function of the form     Show that is not a true catenary.    Plot the graph of equation , and determine the and intercepts.    Notice that the answers in part (b) do not determine an arch whose height and width are exactly feet. This is because this curve represents the centers Actually the centroids. You will learn about centroids when you take Integral Calculus. of the triangular cross sections.   The sketch below represents the cross-sectional slice of the arch, which is an equilateral triangle. In the sketch each side is equal to , and the point is equidistant from , , and . Show that the perpendicular distance from to one side is .      Use the result in part (i) to determine the height and width of the arch.       The curve Saarinen used is called a weighted catenary . It is the shape of a hanging chain whose density is not uniform. Saarinen decided to go with this since the size of the triangles was decreasing as they approached the apex of the arch. A true catenary arch would be something of the form Plot the graphs of equation and equation on the same set of axes and use this to show that they both have the same requisite height and width.      Exponential Growth   Population Growth  Suppose we start with a colony of grams of bacteria in a Petri dish and we wish to model the growth of the population as a function of time. In order to keep our initial discussion simple we begin by assuming that % of our bacteria divide once per day at the same time. Such a population is growing at a rate of % per day. If we start with grams of bacteria on day zero, then on day one we ll have more, or grams. On day two we ll have more than on day one, or grams. It should be clear that the rate of growth from day to day is proportional to how many bacteria we have on day . Thus from any one day to the next we see that the change in (that is, ) is given by where day, and is the change in population on that day.  But we assumed that % of the bacteria were dividing in sync once per day, which is unrealistic. To get closer to reality suppose next that enough of them divide during any one hour so that at the end of one day the population has still grown by %. Then from any one hour to the next we again have equation but this time is equal to one hour, or day. However, we don t have to measure time in days. If we measure it in hours instead we again have . The constant factor is still because we assumed that the population was growing at per day, and this is still true. That factor is called the nominal growth rate.   Mathematical Terminology  The word nominal means in name or thought so this is the named growth rate. It is not always the actual growth rate as we will see soon.   If we measure time in seconds the same reasoning will give us equation , with . If we measure in nanoseconds we get equation , with . If we measure time in infinitesimal increments we get   Notice that we are using the Principle of Local Linearity here. In this infinitesimal time interval the nominal growth rate, , is virtually constant and so we are treating it as linear growth.  Since we started with grams of bacteria we have the initial condition . This says that the amount of bacteria at time must satisfy the IVP: Take specific notice that the differential equation in IVP expresses the idea that the rate of change of the population, , is proportional to the size of the population, . The constant of proportionality is , or .  Clearly there is nothing particularly special about the number If our colony had been increasing at a nominal rate of we d have arrived at the IVP:     To begin solving IVP show that one solution of the differential equation  , from IVP is: There are other solutions. Find one of them.   From we see that a solution of the differential equation in our bacterial growth problem, IVP , is . But does not satisfy the initial condition since \\begin{align*} \\rho(0)\\amp =e^{(0.3)0}\\\\ \\amp = e^0\\\\ \\amp =1\\neq10, \\end{align*} so can t be the solution of our bacterial growth problem, IVP .  We ve found that satisfies the differential equation but not the initial condition. Can we tweak this so that it satisfies the initial condition?   Find the Pattern       Show that solves the differential equation: . What is ?    Show that solves the differential equation: . What is ?    Show that if is any constant then solves the differential equation . What is ?    Did your answer in part (c) account for the possibility that ? If not, redo it assuming that . What is in this case?          Use the results of parts (a) and (b) of to show that is the solution of equation .    According to the model in part (a), how much did the colony grow over the first day and how does this compare to the growth rate of ?    Use the model to predict the size of the colony in days. Is this reasonable? What does it say about our assumptions in this problem?    Suppose our growth rate was per day. Would the bacteria have grown half as much in the first day as it did when the growth rate was per day?  Make your best guess.  Use Calculus to test your guess.      In general, if we start with a population of, say , and the rate of change of is proportional to itself then it will satisfy an IVP of the form: The constant is called the nominal growth rate as we ve seen. Because it is also called the relative growth rate of the population and is often given as a percentage, as we have done here.  The IVP should look familiar to you. Notice that when and it is the same as IVP which we used to define the the natural exponential. Except, of course, for the names of the variables. To put it another way IVP is the special case of IVP when Since these are so similar it is not surprising that the solution of IVP involves the natural exponential.   Problem and suggest, rather convincingly, that the general solution of IVP is    Show that is a solution of IVP .   Part (c) in Problem indicates that there are limitations to the usefulness of IVP and its solution, . If we use it to predict how much bacteria there would be after one year we get grams. Since current estimates of the mass of the entire universe are around grams, it is pretty clear that our model doesn’t work in the long term.  Clearly the bacteria can not sustain a growth rate of indefinitely. If nothing else, they will eventually run out of food. Our point here is that this model, like all models, is limited. To use a mathematical model effectively we need to stay within its limitations.  But in the short term this is actually a very good model. The picture below shows the surface of Lake Erie during what is called an algal bloom.        The green discoloration on the western side of the lake is from an explosive (exponential) growth of algae. When the conditions for algae growth are nearly optimum if there is abundant food, there is room for the population to expand into, and the water temperature is exactly right the population of algae in Lake Erie tracks with our model nearly perfectly. The quantity of algae grows exponentially until the conditions become sub-optimal. Then the population of algae drops again to normal levels.   Comment  Except that the nominal growth rate and the initial condition would need to be adjusted to fit the situation.   An algal bloom can happen in any body of water where algae grow. They are common in alpine lakes in the early spring when nutrients are released by the melting snow, but the fish and insects that feed on the algae have not yet emerged in large numbers. We will return to this problem in Section where we will tweak this model to extend its usefulness to longer periods of time. But for now we will continue to use this exponential growth model with the understanding that for large values of it is unreliable.    Suppose our bacteria population is increasing at a nominal rate of 10% per day. If we started with 100 grams, how much would there be after one, two, and three days?    Speaking loosely, the observation that lead us to IVP is that the number of baby bacteria in a given generation is proportional to how many parental bacteria were present in the previous generation. Speaking very loosely, more mamas and poppas now, means proportionally more babies later. This is all that is required for exponential growth to occur.    Exponential Functions and Compound Interest  The natural exponential function also arises naturally in financial mathematics. If we invest money in a bond which pays a nominal interest rate of annually, and the interest is compounded quarterly then the effective yield will be .  There is a lot of financial jargon in the previous paragraph which makes it hard to understand if we don t speak financial-ese. So we will take a few pages to learn the vocabulary. After that things will clear up pretty quickly.  To start, the effective yield represents the actual amount of money earned at the end of one year how much money the investment actually pays out. For example, if the investment was not compounded at all, then at the end of one year, every dollar invested would yield in return, so the effective yield is the same as the nominal yield : .  If the investment is compounded semiannually (twice per year), then half of interest earned is paid out midway through the year. This money is then re-invested for the next half year. This is summarized in the table below.            The effective yield in this case is approximately .   % nominal interest compounded semiannually    Time in years  Amount investment is worth in dollars                        The table below shows, in abbreviated form, the computations needed if the investment is compounded three times in a year.   nominal interest compounded three time per year    Time in years  Amount investment is worth in dollars                     Quarterly compounding means that the interest is re-invested four times and is shown in the next table.   nominal interest compounded quarterly    Time in years  Amount investment is worth in dollars                         Notice how these three tables differ, and how they are similar to each other. The effective yield comes from the last entry in each table. It is the difference between the amount the investment is worth at the end of the year and what it is worth at the beginning of the year. So if we compound quarterly the effective yield is   Similarly, if the investment is compounded daily, then the effective yield is . If we compound nominal interest, times in a year, then the return on an investment of one dollar at the end of one year would be dollars, after years dollars, after years dollars.  In general if we let denote the value of the investment of one dollar earning annually, compounded times per year, after years, we have   What if the investment was compounded continuously? That is, suppose the interest is being continuously paid out and simultaneously reinvested? Obviously, this can t actually be done, but it comes to the same thing if at the end of the year we get an effective yield that is equal to the effective yield that would come from continuous compounding. All we have to do is figure out what this is.  To do this, it will be convenient to write as Setting we see that We are particularly interested in the quantity as we compound the interest more frequently (as becomes very large). The following table shows some values of , for large values of . Does the numbers in the right column look familiar to you?   nominal interest compounded continuously         2.70481382942    1000  2.71692393224     2.71814592683    100000  2.71826823717    1000000  2.71828046932    10000000  2.71828169255     In Section we saw that . From this table it would appear that approaches the number as grows larger that is, as we compound the interest more frequently. We will show that this is in fact the case in Section .  If this is true (it is) then if we compound the interest continuously we have This equation was derived under the assumption that our initial investment was only . In general if the initial investment is we have Does this look familiar?   The function has the same form as our solution of IVP so it must satisfy the differential equation: . Confirm that it does.   This is interesting. It appears that IVP\\ models continuously compounded investments as well as population growth. Does this make sense to you?  Think about it for a moment. When money invested the rate of return (rate of growth) is always proportional to the initial investment, in the same way that the rate of growth of a population (the rate of return) is. Speaking very loosely, the amount of baby dollars in the next generation will be proportional to the amount of mama dollars and papa dollars in the current generation in the same way that the number of baby bacteria in the next generation is proportional to the number of parent bacteria now. So it makes sense that these two very different real world phenomena are modeled by the same IVP.  From the point of view of a banker or a biologist, these are very different problems so we assign different meanings to the variables and parameters. But since relationship between the variables and parameters is the same whatever we call them, to a mathematician these are the same problem.  This sort of abstraction is one of the strengths of mathematics. It is not at all obvious that population growth, investment income, or nuclear decay (which we will study shortly) are all essentially the same problem. It is only when we have abstracted out the critical features of each that we can see this.        What would the effective yield be for a bond nominally rated at 5% annually, compounded continuously? How does this compare to the effective yield of an investment compounded daily?    Suppose we had two investments growing continuously with nominal rates of 5% and 10% annually? After one year would the effective yield of the second investment be twice that of the first? Justify your answer.    A natural question to ask is, How long will it take for my money to double? Would an investment compounding continuously at a nominal rate of double in half the time as one growing at a nominal rate of %. Take a guess and write it down for later reference.  To answer this question we d need solve , for and compare this to the solution of . To solve either equation we need a way to undo the natural exponential function. That is, we need the inverse of the natural exponential function. This leads us to a discussion of the natural logarithm function in the next section.    A Short Introduction to Logarithms: John Napier Logs In    In the th and th centuries the computational needs of science, introduction engineering, finance and navigation were growing increasingly complex, time-consuming, and error prone. The problem of navigating at sea using only the stars as a guide was particularly vexing. It became increasingly important to find very accurate methods of computation that were also as simple as they could possibly be; that could be broken down into simple steps that anyone could do without necessarily understanding the underlying concepts. The Scottish mathematician John Napier .    John Napier (1555 1617)          Napier described logarithms in Mirifici logarithmorum canonis descriptio ( A Wonderful Description of the Canon of Logarithms ), published in , well before Newton or Leibniz were born so logarithms actually predate the invention of Calculus by several decades. He coined the term logarithm from the Greek words logos meaning reasoning, or reckoning and arithmos meaning number. To Napier logarithms were reckoning numbers which seems an apt description, given their original purpose.  To see how logarithms work we start with the observation that More generally, if is any positive number and and are any real numbers then The crucial observation here is that exponentiation (raising to a power) takes the addition of the exponents and and turns it into the multiplication of and . Of course, multiplying instead of adding makes computations more complex, not less. This is exactly the reverse of what is needed. What Napier wanted was a way to turn the complexity of multiplication into the simplicity of addition. This would make complex computations -- especially computations done by hand with paper and pencil (the only kind there was in those days) much simpler.  To turn multiplication into addition all we have to do is read the equation in the other direction: Now the multiplication of and has become the addition (in the exponent) of and . Of course there is much more to be done to make this a usable computational scheme. But this is the essential idea. For example if we wanted to use this scheme to multiply we would first need to know that and that . Adding the exponents gives so the result of the multiplication is . The way to make this a workable scheme is to compile a large table of numbers and their associated exponents. This is, essentially, what Napier did.   Historical Background  We re taking liberties with the history here. Napier s original scheme was not based on . We explain how Napier actually defined his logarithms in Digression . For now it is useful to pretend that he used . Also, although Napier started compiling a table of logarithms, sadly he died before finishing. It fell to his friend and colleague Henry Briggs to complete the task.   Today we call and the base 10 , or common logarithms , of , and , respectively. Notationally we have which is simply a way to say and backwards.  In general, , and we see that the function simply undoes the function , which makes the functional inverse of , in exactly the same way that is the functional inverse of as you recall from .  To use a table of base logarithms to find the product of two numbers we would first look up the logarithm of each number, then add the logarithms. The resulting sum is the base logarithm of the product, so we d look up in our table what this sum is the logarithm of. The result is the product of the two original numbers. Since the invention of modern computing technology the original purpose of base logarithms simplifying numerical computations is completely obsolete. So tables of base logarithms are rarely seen in the wild anymore On the other hand the natural exponential function and its functional inverse, the natural logarithm are both still quite useful in a variety of contexts, both scientific and mathematical.        The graph of the natural exponential is very similar to the graph of . As we saw in if we have the graph of some function we can find the graph of its inverse by interchanging the horizontal and vertical axes. As a practical matter, this is the same as reflecting the graph across the line, . The graph of the natural exponential and its inverse the natural logarithm are shown in the diagram at the right.  In the same way that is the functional inverse of the base ten exponential, , the natural logarithm - usually denoted  is the functional inverse of the natural exponential, . This inverse relationship allows us to immediately observe several important properties of the natural logarithm.   Properties of Logarithms  Table Properties of the Natural Logarithm     Property #1:        Property #2:        Property #3:    Notice that this is a special case of Property #1.    Property #4:     Property #5:     Property #6:                      Logarithms, Natural and Unnatural  The properties that make the natural logarithm useful as a theoretical tool are the same properties that made useful as a computational tool. In fact if we replace the base with the base and with all of the properties in this list remain true.                DIGRESSION: Exponential and Logarithmic Notation  Consider reviewing DIGRESSION: Inverse Function Notation . It will probably help.  As we ve observed the natural logarithm function is, by definition, the inverse of the natural exponential in precisely the same way that is, by definition, the inverse of . Unfortunately the notation that is used for the natural exponential and the natural logarithm is not helpful.  It has become standard practice to notate a function using the first three letters of its name. That is why the trigonometric functions are denoted , , , , , and . By that standard we should properly denote the natural exponential with . We have used this notation in the past and will continue to use it when we want to emphasize the functional nature of the natural exponential, but most of the time it is more helpful to think of it as the number raised to a power and to denote it with which, unfortunately, doesn t look like the name of a function at all.  As we saw in DIGRESSION:Inverse Function Notation . This is unfortunate for the student because it adheres to no standard naming scheme whatsoever. But once you get used to it, it isn t so bad.  Sometimes there are reasons to use logarithms with bases other than or . For example, computer scientists frequently use logarithms with a base of which they denote (binary logarithm).   Mathematical Customs  Even worse, when we talk among ourselves mathematicians tend to use the natural logarithm because for us it is the most important, but we often denote it as . When we are talking to scientists and engineers we use whichever notation is appropriate to their discipline.   None of this affects what the natural logarithm is, how we use it, or how we think about it. Only how we write it. We only bring this up to warn you that because of this wide variation in usage logarithmic notation can be hard to get comfortable with. Be careful. The generic notation is where indicates the base. In this scheme the natural logarithm is , the common logarithm is , and the binary logarithm is . If you find yourself getting confused it can help to revert to this generic notation.  It is, after all, just notation. Do not confuse the name of a concept with the concept itself. Conceptually the natural logarithm ( ) is the inverse of the natural exponential ( ) and you should think of it as such.  It is often helpful to think of as the function that peels the exponent off of as in Property #1: .  END OF DIGRESSION   Evaluate each of the following:                                Take the time to become very comfortable using all of the properties of logarithms, for exactly the same reason you took time to become very comfortable with the differentiation rules: Exponential and logarithmic functions are basic tools in science.    Like Property #3, Property #5 is really just a convenience. Show that it is really an immediate consequence of Property #4 and Property #6.    Find a way to express as a product.    The simplest use to which we can put a natural logarithm is to aid in solving an equation like: The difficulty here is that the variable is in the exponent so to isolate it we have to undo an exponential. This is exactly what logarithms do! By Property #6, , so we can solve our equation like this: At this point we can use technology to find that and so that .   Use your favorite computational tool to confirm that .   Find approximate solutions for each of the following equations:                                                                          Similarly if we needed to solve the equation we would take advantage of Property #2. Taking the exponential of both side we see that:   Solve each of the following equations exactly, without the use of technology.                                                                       A particle is moving on the -axis so that its position at time is given by    When is the first time the particle stops moving forward and starts moving backward?    When does the particle start moving forward again?       A particle is moving on the -axis so that its position at time is given by .  Show that this particle never moves backward.  At which times does it stop moving forward?                                Let s return to the question that motivated our look into the logarithm function in the first place: How long will it take for my money to double?    Find the Pattern       Suppose that dollars are invested in two separate accounts, and , where the interest in compounded continuously at the nominal rates of and , respectively. Let be the time it takes for the initial investment in account to double, and let be the time it takes for the initial investment in account to double. Is ?    At the end of the last section we asked you to guess the answers to part (a). Did you guess correctly? What was the intuition that lead you to your correct, or incorrect, guess?    Suppose that dollars are invested in two separate accounts, and , where the interest in compounded continuously at the rates and , respectively. Let be the time it takes for the initial investment in account to reach , and let be the time it takes for the initial investment in account to reach , were is some positive number. How are and related?                          When we were modeling exponential population growth, we always stated the relative growth rate for you, but in real applications this rate will rarely be known a priori . Usually we will have to compute the relative growth rate based on other information from the problem. For this, logarithms are needed. An example will help to clarify what we mean.   Suppose we have a bacteria culture which grows at a rate proportional to the amount of bacteria present. Suppose further that it has been observed that we have grams of the bacteria initially, then hours later we have grams. Can we predict how much would we have in hours?  Let represent the amount of bacteria present. This time our model is     Before we proceed, try to guess how much bacteria we will have after hours. Will it be grams? grams? More? Less? Write down your best guess. We will revisit this in , as soon as we have a formula for .   Note that our model is an IVP plus the extra datum: . The first two pieces of our model, , and , define an IVP very similar to IVP . In fact the only difference is that where we had before, we now have the unknown parameter, . In we saw that so it appears that the solution of the problem in this example must be but we don t know the value of (yet).  To determine , we use the second datum. Since we have . Had we not taken the trouble to invent the natural logarithm it would be very difficult to proceed from this point. Since we did take the trouble, the next step is straightforward. Taking the natural logarithm of both sides, we see that or Thus our growth model for this bacterial growth culture is   Expressing it in this form is cumbersome. It is not wrong, just awkward. We can use the properties of exponents to clean it up at bit. This is not strictly necessary, but in general the simpler we keep our notation the better. Using the properties of exponents and the mutually inverse nature of the natural exponential and the natural logarithm, we have   So after hours we have    How good was your guess in ? Whether it was good or bad isn t really the point. Either way take a moment to hone your guessing skills by considering why you guessed the way you did. What was your intuition telling you about the problem?   A natural question to ask is, How long will it take for the culture to reach grams? Translating this into a mathematical question, we want to find when , That is, we need to solve for .   Show that      At a certain time a Petri dish contains grams of bacteria. Three hours earlier it contained grams of bacteria.    Find a formula for the function, , which gives the amount of bacteria at any time, .    How long does it take for the dish to contain grams of bacteria?                Starting with an unknown number of bacteria a culture is growing at a nominal (relative) rate of .    How long does it take for the culture to double in size?    How long does it take for the culture to triple in size?               Applications of Logarithms   Radioactive Dating  Radioactive isotopes have the curious property that in time they break down into other, more stable, substances. This process is known as radioactive decay . While there is no way to predict when an individual radioactive atom will decay, the decay of a large collection of radioactive isotopes is very regular and can be predicted.  For example, if we have two pounds of the radioactive isotope Cesium-137 it is known that after the passage of years and days we will have only one pound. The rest will have decayed into barium. Even more curious though, is this: If we wait another years and days only one-half pound of the remaining one pound will have decayed. The numbers change depending on the isotope but the general principle is that a fixed percentage of a radioactive isotope will decay during a fixed interval of time.  Do you see the implications of this? Since a fixed percentage decays in a fixed time interval the rate of change of will be proportional to itself. Since this is exactly what we said about both population growth and return on investment, IVP should model this phenomenon as well. There is, of course, the difference that the quantity is now shrinking rather than growing. How do you think that will manifest in our model? Take a guess.   For the sake of being definite suppose that our isotope is decaying (shrinking) at a relative ( nominal ) rate of . Then if we start with Kg, the IVP to be solved is which we recognize as a special case of IVP , so the solution will be   Wait a minute. This can t be right. It says that the number of isotopes is increasing, not decreasing. Graph it and see.  So what did we do wrong?  The derivative of is its rate of change. If is increasing then its rate of change is going to be positive. If it is decreasing then its rate of change will be negative. We seem to have committed one of the classic blunders of mathematics. We got the sign wrong. We should have been solving the IVP instead of IVP . Since IVP also has the same form as IVP , the correct solution is     Graph to confirm that it is decreasing.   Did you guess correctly that the sign of the exponent would be negative in this model?   Suppose we have pounds of a very unstable isotope which is known to lose half of its mass to radioactive decay in hours. If we let be the mass of our isotope sample at any time , then the IVP we need to solve is\\aside{In view of our discussion above about positive versus negative rates of change it is tempting to write the differential equation as . While this is not necessarily wrong, it is not helpful. The variable can be any number, positive or negative. If we do our analysis correctly the correct value will emerge. As always the solution of a differential equation of this form is where and is an unknown constant. To find we must use the additional information given. Half of our isotope s mass is lost in hours, so . Thus or Thus This is correct but again it is cumbersome. Also the lack of an obvious negative in the exponent is a little troubling.     Use the properties of logarithms and exponentials to show that .    Use the properties of logarithms and exponentials to show that              The length of time that it takes for a quantity of a radioactive isotope to decay by one-half is called the half-life of the isotope. Each substance has its own half-life. The half-life for Carbon-14 is roughly years; for Fluorine-18, it is minutes; for Potassium- , it is billion years.   Comment  In fact, all substances have a half-life. But some half-lives are more useful than others.     A certain isotope has a half-life of , and is decaying exponentially:     Find the value of in terms of .    Use the result of part (a) to show that the amount of our radioactive material at time is given by     The formula in part (a) is correct but it is a little awkward to use, as written. Use the properties of exponents and logarithms to show that this can be rewritten as What are   and Is this consistent with calling the half-life? Explain.                       Radiocarbon is a radioactive isotope of carbon which is constantly being created in the atmosphere by the interaction of cosmic rays with atmospheric nitrogen. The resulting radiocarbon combines with atmospheric oxygen to form radioactive carbon dioxide, which is incorporated into plants by photosynthesis. Animals then acquire by eating the plants. When the animal or plant dies, it stops absorbing carbon from the environment. From that point onward the amount of it contains begins to decrease as the undergoes radioactive decay. During life the ratio of to other, stable, isotopes remains stable. However after an organism dies this ratio begins to decrease due to the decay of   By measuring the amount of in a sample from a dead plant or animal such as a piece of wood or a fragment of bone we can calculate, approximately when the plant or animal died. This is called radiocarbon dating , and it was developed by Willard Libby (1908-1980), in . Radiocarbon dating revolutionized the field of archaeology and Libby was awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in for this development.          The Shroud of Turin, shown below, is a Christian religious relic which bears an image of a man. Some people believe it is the burial cloth of Jesus and that the image is that of Jesus himself. In the Vatican agreed to subject pieces of the shroud to radiocarbon dating. In this problem we will recreate the computations done to determine the age of the Shroud. Let be the amount of (in mg) at time years, where represents when the shroud was used. Let be the initial amount of present in the sample.     How much would be present if the shroud was 2000 years old?    If one of the samples of the Shroud contained 88.9% of the original . How old would this sample be?    This does not settle the question of the age of the Shroud. The technique of carbon dating is not in dispute, but there are other issues including questions about the quality of the samples.

In medicine, Positron Emission Tomography (PET) scans use radioactive tracers to image body functions. One of the most commonly used radioactive tracers is Fluorine-  which has a half life of minutes. Typically is injected into the body and the imaging is done about one hour after the tracer is injected. Suppose that units of must remain in the body for the PET scan results to be useful. How much must be injected into the patient minutes prior?      The half-life of limits it to dating artifacts that are no older than years. What percentage of the original amount of would remain in a -year-old artifact? How does this explain the limitation on radiocarbon dating?      The radioactive isotope Potassium-  has a half life of billion years. Radiometric dating using is especially effective for dating very old volcanic rock as the quickly cooling lava traps the Argon formed by the decaying of This has been used by scientists to study the frequency of geomagnetic reversals. A geomagnetic reversal is a change in the earth s magnetic polarity where the magnetic north and south poles (not to be confused with the geographic north and south poles) are switched. Basically, the magnetic polarity of the planet is recorded in cooled lava flows. By dating the age of the lava flows, scientists can date these reversals.    A rock sample which appears to have a reversed magnetic field is determined to contain between and of the that it originally contained. Approximately how old is the rock?    Approximately what is the age of the youngest rock that can be dated using this technique?                             Chillin with Newton: The Law of Cooling   Suppose a container of water at a temperature of is placed into a freezer maintained at a constant temperature of We d like to have a model that will allow us to compute how long it will take for the water to cool down to a temperature of, for example, where it will start to freeze.  In the late th century Isaac Newton showed experimentally that the rate at which the water cools will be proportional to the difference between its current temperature and the ambient (surrounding) temperature. This is known as Newton s Law of Cooling and it holds generally, not just for water.  For this problem we see that the ambient temperature is and the initial temperature of the water is . We let represent the temperature of the water at any given time. Then the difference between the current temperature and the ambient temperature is , and (as always) the rate of change of the temperature of the water with respect to time is , (or if you are Newton). Letting be the (unknown) constant of proportionality we have the IVP   This differential equation looks like it will be tougher to solve than the IVPs we dealt with earlier. But in fact we can make this problem easier on the eyes with the substitution . Notice that so we have the IVP Do you recognize this equation? This has the same form as IVP so the solution is Reversing the substitution we see that   To complete our model we need to determine . We can find if we know the temperature of the water at a second time during the cooling. Assume that we measured the temperature of the water after minutes and it was Thus we have so that and our complete model is   Newton s Law of Cooling accurately models the cooling of any object placed in cooler surroundings. We used water in our example just to be definite.    Since the temperature of the water is decreasing we would expect to be less than zero. Show that it is.         Answer the original question: How long does it take for the water to cool from to     Take a guess: Would it take the same amount of time to cool another from to Check to see if your guess was correct.    What would the initial temperature of the water need to be to take twice as long to cool to as it did for the water?                  The forensic rule of thumb for determining the time of death of a person is to start with a body temperature of and\\aside{Notice that we ve switched to measuring temperature in degrees Celsius.} subtract for each hour the person is dead. Of course, this simple linear model isn t as accurate as Newton s Law of Cooling since it does not take into account the surrounding temperature, size of the body, etc. and can only be applied until the temperature of the body reaches the surrounding temperature.    Suppose the ambient temperature is Using the forensic rule of thumb, how long would it take for the body to reach the ambient temperature? Using the forensic rule of thumb, what would the body temperature be halfway through the cooling process.    Use the temperature predicted by the rule of thumb at the halfway point to give a complete model of the body s cooling as predicted by Newton s Law of Cooling.    Of course, in Newton s Law of Cooling, the body temperature will never quite reach the ambient temperature, but just for comparison, substitute the time when the rule of thumb predicts that the body temperature is and see how close it is to the ambient temperature.    Using the answer you obtained in part (c), find the rate of change of the body temperature at the beginning of the time interval and the rate of change of the body temperature at the end of the time interval. How do these compare with the rule of thumb rate of change?                                    Of course, Newton s Law of Cooling can be used just as well to model an object heating. Consider the following:    A whole turkey is considered to be safely cooked when the internal temperature is Suppose a turkey is taken out of a refrigerator set at and is put directly into an oven set at . You check it hours later and the internal temperature is How much longer does the turkey need to cook?       The Derivative of the Natural Logarithm  Since the natural logarithm is the inverse of the natural exponential we can find its derivative using the same trick that we used to find the derivatives of the inverse trig functions. Start with the identity from Logarithm Property #1: and make this easier on our eyes with the substitution . Differentiating equation we see that . Thus . Once more making the substitution we have , and since we have .   equation is the last differentiation rule you need to memorize. Memorize it.  As always the difficulty here is not remembering what the differentiation rule is, the difficulty is in learning to use it in tandem with all of the other rules. So practice is required. Lots of practice.  For each of the following find , and .                                                                                        For each of the following find , and . (Use the properties of logarithms to make these drills easier on the eyes.)                                             Recall that in we showed the curvature of the graph of a function is given by     Show that the curvature of the graph of is given by Graph both of these functions and use this to approximate the point , where the curvature of the graph of the natural exponential function is the greatest.    Show that the curvature of the graph of the is given by Graph both of these functions and use this to approximate the point , where the curvature of the graph of the natural logarithm is the greatest.    What do you notice about the points where the curvature is greatest in parts (a) and (b)? Does this surprise you? Explain.                                DIGRESSION: A Curious Fact  Digression A Curious Fact   Observe that if then This is, of course, just the Power Rule but we take particular notice of the fact that the Power Rule guarantees that the derivative of any monomial is another monomial. But what happens if we try to go the other direction?   Comment  Actually, this should be plus an arbitrary constant. Do you see why? Since the constant is of no importance to our current point, we ignore it.   If then clearly . In general if then But if running the Power Rule backwards would give us which is meaningless since the denominator is When we get is   It seems very strange that there would be this one, single exception doesn t it? Or, to come at the question a little differently, maybe this says that the logarithm function is somehow related to polynomials? What do you think?   END OF DIGRESSION     General Logarithms and Exponentials   You have no idea how much poetry there is in the calculation of a table of logarithms!   Carl Friederich Gauss (1777-1855)     General Exponentials  So far we ve focused on the natural exponential and logarithm functions even though we started our discussion of logarithms by defining as the inverse of the base- exponential: .  But we ve seen that is also an exponential, and it s inverse is . In fact, we ve seen that for any , , is the base exponential and the corresponding inverse function is called the base logarithm, and is denoted .   Why do we impose the conditions, and ?   Calculus is not needed for the next problem which establishes that all logarithm functions change multiplication into addition (Property 4) and exponentiation into multiplication (Property 6) as we stated (but didn t prove) earlier.    Let , ,  and let be any real number.    Show that    Consider and use the properties of exponents to show that this equals     Show that    Consider and use the properties of exponents to show that this equals .                But if there are so many different exponential and logarithm functions, don t we need differentiation rules for all of them? If so, what are the derivatives of the other exponentials and logarithms?  It is not as hard to differentiate as you might think. Since we already know how to differentiate the natural exponential all we have to do is re-express in terms of .  Here s how to do that. Recall that from the inverse relationship between the natural exponential and the natural logarithm (Properties 1 and 2) . So we make that substitution to get    Comment  Some may see this step as making  harder on the eyes, rather than easier, but often it is often necessary to temporarily make things more complicated so that we can recognize a pattern or to reduce the situation to a previously solved problem.  Don t become rigid in your approach to problem solving. Remain flexible.   Now differentiate: Since is a constant, is also a constant so and since we have Many people simply memorize this formula and you are welcome to do that if you like. However we (the authors) prefer to emulate nature and be lazy. We find it much simpler to find the derivative of by rewriting it as first.  The following problem shows an alternative (and equivalent) method if you can t remember how to rewrite .    Starting with , take the natural logarithm of both sides and solve for to obtain the same formula as above.    Taking a logarithm of complicated formulas sometimes allows us to simplify things considerably via the properties of logarithms. It is a nice trick. Keep it in mind. We ll be using it later.  Find and for each of the following:                                                                General Logarithms  Just as we computed the derivative of the general exponential, by re-expressing it as a natural exponential, we will compute the derivative of the general logarithm, , by re-expressing it as a natural logarithm. This is a bit more difficult, but only a bit.  We begin with the exponential. If then . Taking the natural logarithm of both sides of and using Property 6 we have, , or . Since we have successfully re-expressed the base- logarithm as a natural logarithm: This is why many scientific calculators don t bother including a button.  An easy mnemonic for remembering this formula is to simply notice that on both sides of the equation the appears lower than the .  Since is a constant (why?) we have So we have the differentiation formula:   As with the differentiation formula for general exponential functions we (the authors) find it easier to remember this conversion than the differentiation formula. But you are welcome to memorize it if you prefer.  Compute and for each of the following.                      Assume and let . Show that       For a given sound, the sound power level , in decibels, is given by where is the sound power of the source measured in watts and is the sound reference level taken to be picowatt or watts.    Suppose the sound power of a speaker is watts. How many decibels does this correspond to?    Suppose that the sound power of the speaker is being raised at a rate of watts per second. How fast is the sound power level rising?                      DIGRESSION: Common and Napierian Logarithms    It is a well worn truism among research mathematicians that the first solution of a substantial problem is frequently both very hard to understand and very hard to convey to others, even to other mathematicians. We publish our solutions, in part, so that others can look at the problem, consider the approach used, and find simplifications that the original investigator missed.  This is what happened to Napier. Although his original scheme allowed him to convert multiplication to addition it was more complicated than necessary. Shortly after Napier published his work in , Henry Briggs (1561 1630), Professor of Geometry at Gresham College in London, visited Napier and suggested that a few simple changes to his logarithm table would make it more practical. In particular it was Briggs who suggested that since our number system is in base- , creating a table of base- logarithms might be more useful.  Napier had had the same idea himself, but was unable to pursue it on account of ill-health. As a result, Briggs took on the task of computing tables of base- logarithms, collaborating with Napier until the latter s death two years later. The results of their collaboration are known as the Briggsian or Common Logarithms . Common Logarithms are the base logarithms we discussed earlier and were an important computational aid for nearly years until the invention of modern computational technologies.  As the mathematical historian Howard Eves put it, the invention of (common) logarithms literally doubled the life of the astronomer, because they so drastically reduced the time spent doing arithmetic.  Most modern scientific calculators have both the natural and the common logarithms built in. The ln button on a calculator computes natural logarithms while the log computes common logarithms.    Use whatever technology you prefer to compute the natural logarithms of the numbers and and their product. Confirm that . (If you don t like these numbers use others. We just picked these at random.)    Do the same using common logarithms.    Do the same using . ( Or any other base. Again we just picked at random.)                    A calculator is a useful tool, but only if the human operating it understands what to calculate, and why. Blind computation is pointless and wasteful. As powerful and convenient as our modern technology is, there is still no substitution for a deep understanding of basic principles.  For example, how many base- digits long do you suppose the number is? You cannot solve this by punching into a calculator and counting the digits. Try it and see. If you can solve this by punching into a calculator, that just means that technology has outpaced this particular problem. In that case use a bigger exponent, say .  This feels like the sort of problem a math professor might make up just for fun (though it often feels like we do it just to torment our students), but it is not. Computer programmers routinely have to allocate space in memory to hold information. If the information being held happens to be the number the programmer will need to know how much space to allocate to hold the number.    Show that if is a positive integer and then will have digits to the left of the decimal point. \\\\   This is true because our number system is based on powers of ten. That is, it is based on the base exponential.   Suppose we let and take the base logarithm (common logarithm) of both sides. This gives: Thus Since our number, , is base- digits long. But since computer arithmetic is binary (base- ) what we really need to know how many binary digits (bits) are needed to store a given number.  How many bits are needed to allocate to store these numbers?    ?     ?     ?     ?                 For each of the following numbers:                          Find the number of binary digits needed to store the number.    Find the number of base- digits needed to store the number.    Find the number of base- digits needed to store the number.    Find the number of base- digits needed to store the number.    Find the number of base- digits needed to store the number.                                        The discussion above suggests the question: What base did Napier use when he first invented logarithms, before Briggs suggested using base- ?  Napier defined his original logarithms as follows. Consider a point moving along line segment and a point moving along an infinite ray as seen below.    At the beginnning both and are moving at the same speed, and continues to move at that initial speed. But the speed of is always equal to the distance from to . If we let and , then we define the Naperian Logarithm as   Since Calculus hadn t been invented yet, Napier used Trigonometry to develop his table of logarithms. The details of those computations are not relevant for us, except that he took the length of to be , because the best sine tables at the time were to accurate to seven decimal places.  It is not altogether clear from the description above that the Napierian logarithm actually is a logarithm, let alone what its base is. The next problem explores both of these questions.     In this problem we have suppressed the variable .    Show that , and .    Solve the IVP: , ,    Use the information in parts (a) and (b) to show that Thus the base of Napier s original logarithm was .                   END OF DIGRESSION    Logarithmic Differentiation  Recall that in we observed that the Power Rule does not easily extend to , where is an irrational number. The properties of the natural exponential and the natural logarithm functions will (finally) allow us to make this extension.   Comment  In particular we do not assume that is rational.   Suppose is any real number. Starting with we take the logarithm of both sides, obtaining Differentiating gives Solving for we see that which is the Power Rule. Since we did not constraint except to say that it is a real number the different versions of the Power Rule that we saw in are all special cases of .  The same trick we just used can make some differentiations much easier to do.   For example, suppose we need to differentiate   While we can do this using our Differentiation Rules, it will be very tedious. But nice things happen if we take the natural logarithm of both sides before we differentiate. Since the natural logarithm changes division into subtraction (Property 5) we can rewrite the right side as: And since the natural logarithm changes multiplication into addition (Property 4) we can re-express the right side again. This time as: Re-expressing the square root as an exponent gives . and we can now bring the exponents down in front (Property 6). Notice that we have not yet started differentiating. All we ve done so far is re-express our function using the properties of logarithms.  But differentiating is now relatively easy. If we multiply by we get    This looks like a lot of work when it s laid out on the page but it really isn t. With practice you can differentiate an expression like in your head as fast as you can write it down. Really. Even if this is not true, would you rather compute this derivative using the Quotient Rule and Product Rule?         Recall that in you used the Product Rule to compute . You should redo this problem before attempting .    Let .    Take the logarithm of both sides of this formula and use the properties of logarithms to show that for      Show that the result of part (a) is equivalent to the solution of .                  The technique of taking the logarithm of both sides of an expression like and then differentiating is called Logarithmic Differentiation . It can reduce the amount of tedious computation needed considerably, so it is worth knowing how to use it.    Show that if , then by    Using Logarithmic Differentiation.    Not using Logarithmic Differentiation.    Does either method seem preferable to you? Explain.                  Compute the derivative of each of the following functions.                                            There are some situations where logarithmic differentiation is your only option. Consider something like Unfortunately, this is not a monomial like nor is it an exponential like . This is some strange combination of both and our existing rules don t directly apply. But Logarithmic Differentiation will work.    For each of the following find , and .                                 Finally, because we ve given it a name it is easy to get the impression that Logarithmic Differentiation is a new differentiation rule, but it isn t. It is really just a trick as the next problem shows. A handy trick, to be sure, but still a trick.    Suppose we want to differentiate where and are two differentiable functions.    Compute using Logarithmic Differentiation.    Now express as and compute again using the ordinary rules of differentiation and show that you get the same thing as in part (a).                  Suppose and show that .       Leonhard Euler, Harmonic Oscillators, and Complex Numbers    After exponential quantities the circular functions, sine and cosine, should be considered because they arise when imaginary quantities are involved in the exponential.   Leonhard Euler (1707-1783)   Recall that in Section we saw that the differential equation that models the motion of an object having mass , bouncing on a spring without resistance is the simple harmonic oscillator equation: where is the spring constant. The solution of equation is where and are arbitrary constants.   Equation is unrealisitic because the oscillations described never vary. In the real world, as a result of friction, the spring s oscillations will get shorter and shorter, eventually stopping altogether. How could we modify this model in order to capture the effects of, say, air resistance?  A relatively simple way to model this resistance is to assume that the resistive force is proportional to the speed of the object. This sounds imposing but you are quite familiar with this sort of resistance. If you put your hand out the window of a moving car you ll notice that as the car moves faster there is more force (wind) pushing back on your hand. This simple model breaks down at high speeds where factors such as turbulence will also affect the resistance, but it can be shown experimentally that the assumption that the resistive force is proportional to velocity works well for our spring.  Putting the words resistance is proportional to velocity into symbols means we need to add the term to equation where is a constant which depends on the viscosity of the ambient medium (air, in this case). (Why must this proportionality be negative?)  Thus our model for harmonic oscillation with resistance becomes or  Equation is a little scary to look at, let alone try to solve. We ll begin with a simplified version where :         Show that: satisfies equation for any constants and .    Let and plot this solution for and Does this seem to model a damped oscillation?                It is one thing to confirm a given solution as in , but quite another to find the solution in the first place. A natural question to ask is How was this problem solved the first time?     How Euler Did It   Comment  This heading was borrowed from the series of articles of the same name, written by the late Prof. Ed Sandifer, of Western Connecticut State University     Leonhard Euler              Historical Background   Euler was one of the all-time great mathematicians. In any list of stellar mathematicians, he would stand out among the best. Indeed, Pierre-Simon Laplace , an outstanding mathematician in his own right, was once asked by a novice how best to learn Calculus. Laplace told him Read Euler, read Euler, he is the master of us all.    Leonhard Euler (1707 1783) solved the differential equation by guessing that for some carefully chosen value of  would be a solution. In view of the results of this guess looks completely crazy. Where is the sine? Where is the cosine? Nothing seems to be oscillating!  It is difficult to imagine what might have led him to make such a guess. But Euler knew that if his guess didn t pan out he didn t have to tell anyone about it. He could just toss all of his notes into his fireplace and pretend that he d never made his crazy-seeming guess.  The really crazy thing though, is that Euler s guess worked. Here s how.   Pronunciation  His name is pronounced oiler, not you-ler.    The key is the constant . By leaving it unspecified Euler gave himself a little wiggle room. All he had to do now was find a value of that would work.    Show that if satisfies the differential equation then must satisfy the quadratic equation     Put the first two derivatives of into the differential equation.    Solving equation we see that so we conclude that if or then satisfies equation .  The appearance of is troubling since there is no real number which is the square root of a negative number. But Euler knew that such imaginary numbers had been effectively used in the previous century, although no one could yet explain what they really were. Knowing that if nothing useful came of his efforts he could discard them and try something else, Euler decided to treat the square roots of negative numbers, like differentials, as convenient fictions    Historical Background  Descartes had derided them as imaginary in his book La Geometrie in 1637 . . . whereas we can always imagine as many roots for each equation as I have predicted, there is still not always a quantity which corresponds to each root so imagined.    Since he had assumed that was a constant Euler wanted to see where that assumption would lead. In particular he decided to treat as the constant it is. To make things easier on the eyes, Euler wrote and set .  Euler now had two solutions of equation , one for each possible value of : and but the presence of makes it hard to understand what these solutions could mean.    Assume that is a constant.

  "body": " Population Growth  Suppose we start with a colony of grams of bacteria in a Petri dish and we wish to model the growth of the population as a function of time. In order to keep our initial discussion simple we begin by assuming that % of our bacteria divide once per day at the same time. Such a population is growing at a rate of % per day. If we start with grams of bacteria on day zero, then on day one we ll have more, or grams. On day two we ll have more than on day one, or grams. It should be clear that the rate of growth from day to day is proportional to how many bacteria we have on day . Thus from any one day to the next we see that the change in (that is, ) is given by where day, and is the change in population on that day.  But we assumed that % of the bacteria were dividing in sync once per day, which is unrealistic. To get closer to reality suppose next that enough of them divide during any one hour so that at the end of one day the population has still grown by %. Then from any one hour to the next we again have equation but this time is equal to one hour, or day. However, we don t have to measure time in days. If we measure it in hours instead we again have . The constant factor is still because we assumed that the population was growing at per day, and this is still true. That factor is called the nominal growth rate.   Mathematical Terminology  The word nominal means in name or thought so this is the named growth rate. It is not always the actual growth rate as we will see soon.   If we measure time in seconds the same reasoning will give us equation , with . If we measure in nanoseconds we get equation , with . If we measure time in infinitesimal increments we get   Notice that we are using the Principle of Local Linearity here. In this infinitesimal time interval the nominal growth rate, , is virtually constant and so we are treating it as linear growth.  Since we started with grams of bacteria we have the initial condition . This says that the amount of bacteria at time must satisfy the IVP: Take specific notice that the differential equation in IVP expresses the idea that the rate of change of the population, , is proportional to the size of the population, . The constant of proportionality is , or .  Clearly there is nothing particularly special about the number If our colony had been increasing at a nominal rate of we d have arrived at the IVP:   "

In the late th century Isaac Newton showed experimentally that the rate at which the water cools will be proportional to the difference between its current temperature and the ambient (surrounding) temperature. This is known as Newton s Law of Cooling and it holds generally, not just for water.  For this problem we see that the ambient temperature is and the initial temperature of the water is . We let represent the temperature of the water at any given time. Then the difference between the current temperature and the ambient temperature is , and (as always) the rate of change of the temperature of the water with respect to time is , (or if you are Newton). Letting be the (unknown) constant of proportionality we have the IVP   This differential equation looks like it will be tougher to solve than the IVPs we dealt with earlier. But in fact we can make this problem easier on the eyes with the substitution . Notice that so we have the IVP Do you recognize this equation? This has the same form as IVP so the solution is Reversing the substitution we see that   To complete our model we need to determine .

  "body": " Optimization: Going to Extremes   Introduction: Fermat s Theorem  While it would not be correct to say that Calculus was invented solely to solve optimization problems, it s pretty close. Once it was invented, of course, Calculus turned out to be a very useful tool for lots of other problems as well. Recall that one of the fundamental tenets of modern science is that nature is lazy. Light follows the fastest (minimal) path between two points. Soap bubbles are spherical because that is the shape that encloses the most (maximal) volume for a given surface area. Alternatively, a soap bubble uses the least (minimal) surface area to enclose a particular volume. Nature optimizes.   Comment  Actually, a physicist would say that soap bubbles are spherical because that is the shape the minimizes the potential energy contained in the soap film. It all comes to the same end. Something must be optimized.   Mathematically speaking all optimization starts in the same place: We have some quantity (revenue, tax liability, temperature, resource consumption, travel time, potential energy, volume, surface area, whatever), which depends on one or more variables. The variables are (usually) constrained in some way, and we need to find conditions that make the quantity as large, or as small as possible within those constraints. The thing to be optimized is called the objective function and the constraints on the variables are called . . . well, they re called the constraints .  When we looked at Fermat s Method of Adequality in Section we observed that if is a (continuous) function then near an optimal point as long as is not too big. Loosely speaking, this says that near an extremum the graph of the function is practically horizontal. More formally we have:   Fermat s Theorem  Theorem Fermat s Theorem  If a function, , is differentiable at and is either a maximum or a minimum then .   In view of Fermat s Theorem it appears that a likely strategy for attacking optimization problems is to find an expression, say , for the objective function and then solve the equation . In fact, this is precisely the strategy we used in Section to find the maximal height attained by a tossed ball. If we toss a ball upward we know that it will reach a maximal height. At the top of its flight, when the ball transitions from upward movement to downward movement, there is a moment when its velocity is zero. Thus we saw that if is a formula that gives the height of the ball at any time, setting and solving for will yield the time when the ball is at the top of its flight.   Suppose a ball is tossed vertically from the surface of the earth with an initial velocity of . Show that the ball reaches its maximum height when seconds.   You may want to review .   At their simplest, optimization problems really are just that straightforward. But straightforward does not necessarily mean easy. There are several nuances that, if not clearly understood, can cause much confusion and difficulty. We will proceed carefully.  To begin, take careful note of what Fermat s Theorem says and, just as important, what it does not say: It says that if is a point on the graph of a differentiable function , and if is known to be an extremum (either a maximum or a minimum) then .  Fermat s Theorem does not say that if then must be an extremum. In fact, that is not necessarily true. For example, if then but the graph has neither a maximum or a minimum at . Confirm this by graphing it.  We have a lifetime of experience with tossed balls telling us that a tossed ball will reach a maximum height. Fermat s Theorem tells us that whenever that maximum height is attained, will be zero. So all we had to do for this problem is find the one and only time when . This is the time when the maximum height is reached. But suppose after the ball is released there are forces other than gravity involved. Suppose, for example, that our tossed ball is being buffeted by the wind on a blustery day is such a way that the height of the ball is given by We have no experience, hence no intuition, with a ball moving in this fashion so we have no way to decide if there even is a maximum, let alone what it might be. We also have no tools to help us find the maximum height of the ball if it does exist. Fermat s Theorem doesn t help because it tells us what happens at an extremum , not how to find it. In this chapter we will build up some tools to help us find extrema.   Let    Show that when and when .   Graph . Does it have a maximum? Explain.             Preliminaries: Some Simple Optimizations  To begin we will consider problems that will allow us to use our intuition. Our goal is to build a set of tools. By the end of this chapter we will be able to rely more on the tools of Calculus and less on intuition to solve a wide variety of optimization problems. This does not mean that you should stop using your intuition, only that you will have a set of tools that will allow you to either confirm your instincts, or refute them.  Many of the examples in this section can be solved by more elementary methods than Calculus. If you can see a more fundamental way to solve these problems and examples, that s great! Do that. But keep the goal in mind. We re interested in these examples as a means to elucidate the subtleties inherent in optimization problems. These problems are a means to that end, not an end in themselves.   Constructing A Square on a Line  What is the area of the smallest possible square having one corner at the point and an adjacent corner on the line The diagram below is a visualization of this problem.             We can imagine the blue square growing and shrinking as we move the point along the line. It seems clear that the square having the least area is the one pictured in black (when is at . It is worth taking a moment to notice this explicitly because not all optimization problems are solvable. If we had asked for the largest possible square there would be no solution because the blue square in our diagram can always be make larger by moving the point further to the left on the graph of equation .  But a convincing picture is not a solution. To complete the solution we ll need to compute the coordinates of the point in our sketch and compute the minimal area.  In any optimization problem the first question to ask is, What do we need to optimize? In other words, What is our objective function? For this problem the length of the line segment between the point and any point is given by the Distance Formula: . Therefore the area of the square constructed from this line segment is given by the function: So our objective function is . Since the point is constrained to lie on the line , equation , is our constraint.  Notice that we ve abused our notation a bit. Although the notation indicates that depends on alone, we ve given in terms of both and . But solving equation gives so it should be clear that really depends only on .   Comment  If we make this substitution immediately we can get the objective function solely in terms of : , But does that really help? Either way we re going to have to differentiate . Which form of would you rather use? We think using two variables makes this objective function a bit easier on the eyes.    We ve seen visually that this problem has a solution and Fermat s Theorem tells us that the derivative of our objective function will be zero at that solution. So we differentiate both sides of which gives But recall that and are constrained by the equation from which we see that . Therefore or Setting equal to zero we have From our constraint we have . Inserting this into equation we see that Solving for gives   To find we use our constraint and the value of from equation ,   So we have found that the minimal square occurs when , and and it feels like we re done, doesn t it? We re not. The question asked was What is the area of the smallest possible square? To find the area we need to put into our area formula which yields Always remember to check that you have actually answered the question which was asked before you stop.         Do you see that the point which minimizes the area of our square also minimizes the length of the line segment from to ? What objective function would we get if we tried to minimize the length of the segment instead of the area of the square. Does this change the problem? If so, how?    This example specified that and were adjacent corners of the square. What would the objective function look like if those points were diagonally opposite each other. Does this change the problem? If so, how?                   It seems fairly intuitively clear that the minimal square occurs when the line through is orthogonal to the graph of the line .   Mathematical Nomenclature   Orthogonal is the word mathematicians use when everyone else would say perpendicular. The reasons for this are abstruse.     Verify that our intuition is correct.    Does this remain true if the point on the line and are not adjacent corners of the square?                 We have a few general comments regarding Example .   The first step in any optimization problem is to identify the objective function. Sometimes more than one will work. In that case use the simplest one, but without an objective function we can t even get started.    The first step in any optimization problem is to identify the objective function. Sometimes more than one will work. In that case use the simplest one, but without an objective function we can t even get started.    We need to identify constraint(s) as well, if any exist. (Not all optimization problems will have constraints. Some will have more than one.) We may not need these immediately, but we will need them sooner or later.    It was intuitively clear from our sketch that there actually is a minimal square in this example; that a solution exists. This will be true often enough that it will be easy to start believing that you can rely on your intuition alone to solve optimization problems. This is a mistake. Intuition is important and we encourage you to use it, especially when you first start thinking about a new problem. But intuition is based on past experience. It is a way of saying that you expect today to go pretty much the same way yesterday did. Most of the time this is true, but you never know when things will go awry so you must always verify that your intuition is correct by some other means. Calculus, in this case.    Most of the heavy lifting in this problem was done in the Algebra, not the Calculus. This will be true of many of the mathematics problems you will encounter from now on. There is a strong tendency to think of algebraic manipulations as just algebra and to be careless with them. This is a mistake. Every step toward solving a problem is just as important as every other step, whether it is Algebra, Calculus, Geometry, Arithmetic, or just thinking about the problem. Every step must be successfully completed. Strive to be skillful, and careful, with all of your tools.    We were very careful to write out, in detail, every algebraic and arithmetic step in this problem but if we were to do this for every problem this text would become too long to be useful. We don t want that to happen so we will regularly do several elementary algebraic steps at once. But elementary does not mean easy. You may not be able to follow all of the steps in your head, especially at first. When you do not see how to get from one line of computation to the next you may be tempted to just skip it.  Don t. Do. That.  Keep a writing pad handy at all times. If there is any question of understanding a given computation take out that pad and do the computation yourself. If you are unable to do the computation yourself, ask for help. Ask a classmate, a friend, your instructor, whomever. Ask for help when you need it. If you do this habitually you will find that following the steps gets easier over time. If you do not it will remain difficult forever. We re serious. Do all elementary computations yourself! It is your responsibility to make sure you understand the computations we show you.      Constructing A Square on a Circle  We want to find the area of the largest and the smallest squares that can be constructed with one corner at the point and an adjacent corner on the unit circle: .  The solution of this problem is very clear once it has been sketched. The purpose of is for you to see the solution intuitively. We will solve it again analytically below.   Sketch the unit circle, plot the point , and draw the smallest and largest squares you can which have one corner at the point and an adjacent corner on the unit circle: .   Explain how you can tell from your sketch that that there is both a maximal (largest area) and a minimal (smallest area) square.    Explain how you can tell from your sketch, that the second corner of the maximal and minimal squares are at the intersection points of the line and the unit circle.    Show that the areas of the maximal square is units and that the area of the minimal square is units.                      The solution in relies heavily on the intuition gained from sketching the problem. As we have said many times you should use your intuition but not rely on it. To confirm our solution in using Calculus tools we will start at the beginning and solve this problem again, relying as much as possible on our computations. Eventually, we would like to rely exclusively on our computations, but this is not quite possible yet.  We have the same objective function as in : . So as before. But this time our constraint is so . Plugging this into equation we have   In order to use Fermat s Theorem we must first know that one maximum and one minimum exists. No computation we ve done guarantees the existence of an extremum, let alone its location. However, as a result of the work you did to solve we do know, intuitively, that there are two optimal solutions: one maximal and one minimal. Therefore Fermat s Theorem does guarantee that at each of these (wherever they are) .  We proceed as just discussed. Since we know (from ) that both a maximal and a minimal solution exist we set . Solving this yields and since (from our constraint, equation )) we have The square root symbol, and the plus-or-minus ( ) make equation seem a little scary at first but it is really just a quadratic equation in disguise. Squaring both sides of equation gives or   So we have two solutions: and . From we know that these must correspond to the maximal and minimal solutions. Fermat s Theorem doesn t tell us which is which but now all we need to do is distinguish between them by evaluating for each.    Show that the area of the maximal square is approximately units. Which value of does this correspond to?    Show that the area of the minimal square is approximately units. Which value of does this correspond to?             Since a circle is a special case of an ellipse the following problem is a slight generalization of . But the algebra is a bit trickier.    There are two extremal squares with one corner at and an adjacent corner on the ellipse: Find the area of each one of them.  Steps (a) through (g) will guide you through the process. Not all of the problems in these steps are easily solved algebraically. Use Newton s Method or computational software as needed to find approximations.    Draw a sketch of this problem. Explain how you can tell from the sketch that there is one maximal, and one minimal square.    The objective function for this problem is, once again: What is the constraint?    Use the constraint to show that and that     Show that .    Show that if we choose then the only root of is .    Show that if we choose then the only root of is .    Find (approximately) the area of the square associated with both of these points. Which one is the maximal and which is the minimal square?                                    Here is a sketch of the optimal squares in . Notice that for both the maximal and the minimal square one of the sides appears to be orthogonal to (the line tangent to) the ellipse.      Show that they actually are orthogonal.    It is generally true that the shortest (or longest) line segment from a point to a curve, , will be orthogonal to the line tangent to the curve at their point of intersection. The figure below shows an arbitrary, differentiable curve, , and an arbitrary point .    Suppose that the area of a square with one corner at and an adjacent corner on the curve at is optimal (minimal or maximal) at . Show that the line joining and is orthogonal to the tangent line of at . Try to solve this problem completely on your own, but if you get stuck here is an outline you can follow:   Find the objective function, . (This will be the area of the square on the line from to .)    Use the fact that to find the slope of at .    Find the slope of the line from to .    Compare the two slopes.    What happens if the tangent line is horizontal? If it is vertical?                                                          Differentials vs. Derivatives  Take a moment to consider . Is it clear to you that there must be such a maximal rectangle? If so then, as before, setting the derivative of the objective function equal to zero and solving for the variable will provide all of the values of the variable where the maximal rectangle might occur. If we re lucky there will only be a few such and we can check them one at a time.  Finding the objective function is easy. The area , of any rectangle is its length, , times its width, , so is the objective function.  The perimeter, is and is constrained to be a constant (fixed) value so equation is the constraint. Throughout this example keep in mind that is a fixed constant, not a function of and .  At this point we can complete the problem using Calculus in either of two equivalent ways.   Using Differentials:  In our opinion this is how Leibniz intended for his Calculus to be used so we tend to favor it.   Compute , from the objective function.    Differentiate the constraint, giving the differential form of the constraint:     Set and solve this equation using the constraint and its differential form as needed. In this problem we have so Since we have and thus the square encloses the most area.       Using Derivatives:  The modern approach emphasizes the use of functions and derivatives rather than curves and differentials.   Solve the constraint for either or in terms of the other. For example,     Substitute this into the objective function to rewrite it in terms of a single variable:     Now think of the objective function, , as an abstract function and find its maximum point by setting and solving for .  Proceeding, we have so . Putting this back into our constraint gives we see that is also equal to . Since the square encloses the most area.        As we said, the two approaches are completely equivalent. Use whichever feels most comfortable to you.   In Chapter we used Fermat s Method of Adequality to solve the following problem which is closely related to ,    Find the dimensions of the rectangle having the smallest perimeter, given that the area is fixed. Since we are still relying on Fermat s Theorem, the first step is to convince yourself that this problem has a solution. Once you have done that, use both of the approaches outlined in to complete the solution. Which method do you prefer?            Consider all lines connecting the point to an arbitrary point , on the unit circle as pictured. There is clearly one point where the slope of the associated line is maximum and another point where the slope of the associated line is minimum. These are the outermost lines depicted in the figure. Find an equation for each of these lines. If you aren t sure how to begin use the following steps.    Find an appropriate objective function for this problem.    Find the constraint for this problem.    Differentiate both your objective function and your constraint to show that the points where the maximum and minimum slope occur must satisfy    Comment  There is usually more than one way to solve a given problem so it is possible that you came up with a different equation than we did. That s OK. Solve the problem using yours and use ours to check your solution.     Solve equation and the constraint simultaneously to find the equations of the lines with maximal and minimal slope. Verify your answer by graphing both lines and the unit circle.                                    Sketch the graphs of and and convince yourself that there is a point on each graph which is closest to the origin.   Find the approximate coordinates of the point on the curve that is closest to the origin.    Find the approximate coordinates of the point on the curve that is closest to the origin.    Are the solutions of parts (a) and (b) related? Explain.               Suppose a point is moving in a plane so that its coordinates are given by:    Find the value of where the point, , is closest to the origin. Is it clear that there is such a point?    Find the coordinates of the point s location when it is closest to the origin.                       Of all the rectangles that can be inscribed in the unit circle show that the one with the maximum area is a square.    Of all the rectangles that can be inscribed in the ellipse show that the one with the maximum area is three times taller than it is wide.    Of all the rectangles that can be inscribed in the ellipse show that the one with the maximum area is four times wider than it is tall.    Of all the rectangles that can be inscribed in the ellipse show that the one with the maximum area has a height to width ratio of .                     DIGRESSION: Triangles With Fixed Perimeters    In Examples and we saw that of all rectangles with fixed perimeter, the square (an equilateral rectangle) has the largest area. Is this also true of triangles? More precisely, does an equilateral triangle have the largest area out of all triangles with a fixed perimeter? This may sound like a simpler problem but it is actually a bit harder.  Here s why. With a rectangle each set of parallel sides varied together so we only had two independent parameters to deal with. For triangles all three sides vary independently, giving us three independently varying parameters, which is inherently more complex than two.  How might we address this question?  A standard ploy for solving difficult problems is to first try a simpler adjacent problem. To create such a problem in this case we hold one side fixed and only allow two sides of our triangle to vary. We ll show that when the area of the triangle is maximal the two varying sides must be the same length. We want to use this adjacent problem to gain some insight into how to solve our actual problem.  So our adjacent problem is this: Given all triangles with a fixed base and a fixed perimeter, does an isosceles triangle have the largest area? The sketch below has all of the pertinent parameters labeled.       If we hold fixed then minimizing the area, , is equivalent to maximizing . So the length of is the natural objective function for this problem. Also if is at its maximum then by Fermat s Theorem , . Notice that there are two right triangles in our sketch and is the height of both of them.         Use the sketch in to express as a function of and and show that when is maximal .    Express as a function of and and show that when is maximal .    Use the fact that is constant to find an equation relating and .    Use the fact that the perimeter is constant to find an equation relating and .    Use the results from parts (a), (b), (c), and (d) to show that is maximized when    Use an appropriate trigonometric function.    Use part (e) to conclude that the base angles, and , must be congruent and thus .                         To show that the maximal area of an arbitrary triangle with a fixed perimeter must be equilateral we do not need Calculus, only reasoning. An example of the kind of reasoning we need appears in the Sherlock Holmes short story The Adventure of the Beryl Coronet . Early in the story Holmes says to Watson,    It is an old maxim of mine that when you have excluded the impossible, whatever remains, however improbable, must be the truth.     Mathematical Nomenclature  Holmes is using a tried and true mathematical proof technique, known colloquially as the process of elimination. In mathematics it goes by its Latin name Reduction Ad Absurdum (RAA). If only one of two statements can be true -- for example a triangle is either equilateral or it is not -- we show logically that one of them is impossible under the constraints of the problem. We then conclude that the other statement must be true. In this way we eliminate the impossible so what is left must be the truth. \\\\ If more than two statements are possible and we can eliminate all but one, that one must be the truth. If only two statements are possible, as in this problem, the method is also called Proof by Contradiction .   Our solution will follow Holmes lead: We will eliminate what is impossible leaving only the truth behind.   The Largest Triangle with a Fixed Perimeter is Equilateral   Observe that every triangle is either equilateral, or it is not equilateral.     Suppose we have a triangle with sides , , and which is not equilateral. Then at least two sides, say and , are not equal. Explain how implies that there must be another triangle with the same perimeter and a larger area.    Use Holmes maxim to explain why a triangle with a fixed perimeter enclosing maximal area must be equilateral.                    END OF DIGRESSION     Reflections, Refractions, and Rainbows   Because they are called Optimization Problems it is natural to assume that such problems are always about finding the maximum or minimum value of something. Certainly many of them are, but not all. Optimization problems come in two flavors:   Find the extreme values of some objective function, if there are any. Examples of this kind of problem are , and , , and .    Show that some property holds when the objective function is optimized. Examples of this kind of problem are , , and .       Reflection            Another example of this second type is problem . Recall that we showed that light bounces off of a mirror in such a manner that the angle of incidence equals the angle of reflection. We did this by reasoning geometrically from the figure below to show that the minimal path must satisfy the condition .   The geometric argument was actually pretty easy to understand once we found the right trick. But that s the difficulty. The geometric argument required the very counter-intuitive trick of pretending that the light passed through the mirror instead of reflecting off of it! Calculus provides a more systematic approach, one that does not require a stroke-of-genius level of insight to solve each new problem. Let s re-solve this problem, this time using the Calculus tools we ve learned.  We will need an objective function so we modify the sketch above to suit the needs of Calculus. In particular, the relevant quantities need names as shown below.     We assume that (the height of the light source), (the height of the observer s eye), and (the distance between the light source and the observer) are constants while , and are variables.  We wish to show that when the path of the light from to to is shortest, then . Since the length of that path is a natural objective function is: We also have the following constraints and   Differentiating equation gives .  Differentiating equation gives so, combining these two results, we have   Differentiating Equation gives , so   And finally differentiating equation gives , so that or   Now suppose that the path from to to is the shortest possible path, i.e., suppose that is minimal. Then by Fermat s Theorem we know that , and therefore Since and we see that .  This Calculus based argument is not as elegant as the geometric argument we used in Chapter . In the geometric argument we could easily visualize what was happening. Our Calculus based argument wasn t at all visual and it involved a lot of computation. But, believe it or not, this is a strength not a weakness. None of the computations are particularly hard, just tedious and detailed. But -- and this is the point -- we also had a clearly defined procedure to follow. We needed to: (1) Compute , and (2) set equal to zero. The rest was Algebra which is straightforward though not necessarily easy.    In the figure above suppose that , , and .    Show that .    Show that the solution of is .    Use the result of part (b) to show that .               Refraction: Snell s Law  Snell s Law Derivation via differentials  We began the derivation of Snell s Law in Section , using the following sketch and assuming that the velocity of light in Medium 1 is , and the velocity of light in Medium 2 is .    In we found that the time for a ray of light to travel from point to point is given by But we stopped there with the comment that, although Fermat successfully proved Snell s Law by minimizing using his Method of Adequality, it is very very difficult to do. We said we would return to the problem when we could use the rules of Calculus. The time to do that has arrived.  Notice that we have an optimization problem. The objective function we need to minimize is . There are several constraints. For example, is one. Another is . There is at least one more.  It is tempting to compute and proceed to solve as we ve done before. Computing is a bit challenging but it can be done if you proceed carefully.  The real issue is solving for . Unfortunately, this is still rather difficult to accomplish. But fortunately we we are not really interested in the value of when is minimal. We want to show that the tie traveled along the path from to to is minimal when . We ll proceed carefully.        We know that the total time traveled from point to to is given by Write down all of the constraints involving the variables , , , and , and the constants , , and . (We ll ignore and for now.)    Show that when is minimum (that is, when ) we have     Use equation to derive Snell s Law of refraction: .    Assuming that the speed of light in water is about of the speed of light in air, use Snell s Law to determine the range of possible angles for as ranges from to .                                     Snell s Window Physically, what Part says is that when you are beneath the surface of a pond and look upward the entire view of the world above the surface is compressed into a circle at the top of a cone with central angle . Attempts to look beyond that angle will result in you seeing a (probably dark) reflection from the bottom of the pond as no light that enters from above and outside this circle will reach your eye at point . This phenomenon is called Snell s Window and is illustrated in the image below.    Snell s window. Photo courtesy of Eric Cheng.     The solution to the following problem will rely on a derivation similar to the one we used to prove Snell s Law.    Suppose that the cost to run a fiber optic cable underwater is ( ) times the cost to run it on land. We wish to run a fiber optic cable from point  km from the river, to point on the other side km downstream. The river is km wide.      Show that the value of necessary to minimize the cost of running the cable must satisfy the equation     When the formulas we re working with get this complicated it is a good idea to check them against our intuition in simple cases. Does this formula make sense to you when ?    Use any appropriate technology, or Newton s Method, to provide approximate values for in the following table                                             Do these values surprise you? Explain.                                             Rainbows  Look carefully at the double rainbow in the pictures below and notice that the order of the colors is reversed from the primary (brighter) to the secondary rainbow? Why do you think this happens?    A few other questions come readily to mind. What conditions are required for a rainbow to form? Why is red on the top of the primary rainbow but at the bottom of the secondary? Why is the primary rainbow below the secondary one? Why is the primary rainbow brighter and why are double rainbows so rare?  To tackle these questions the first thing we ll need to do is build a mathematical model of the problem. As you will see developing the model is probably the most challenging part.  When a ray of light enters a raindrop it gets both refracted and reflected, so we will need to use all that we have learned about how light refracts and reflects. Clearly Snell s Law will play a prominent role. To keep things simple we assume the drop is spherical.             By the Principle of Local Linearity when light strikes a point on a curved surface it will refract (if the surface is transparent) or reflect (if the surface is reflective) as if the surface is actually the line tangent to the surface. Since we re assuming for simplicity that our raindrops are spherical this means that the light will reflect or refract as if it is striking the tangent line of the circle in the diagram at the point where the light enters the droplet, , exits the droplet, , or reflects inside of the droplet, . All of the angles in the diagram at the right are measured between the light beam (in red) and the extended radii (blue, dashed lines) at points , , and .  As displayed in the diagram above, the light ray traveling at velocity , entering the raindrop at and making an angle of radians with the radial line is refracted to an angle of radian measure according to Snell s Law: where is the velocity of light inside the raindrop. It is helpful to think of this refraction as a rotation about the point . This is Rotation 1 in the diagram below. The reflection at point and the refraction at point can similarly be thought of as rotations about their respective points.              Actually, only a portion of the light is refracted. The rest is reflected off the exterior of the raindrop, and is no longer of concern to us. Once inside the raindrop, it reflects off of the back of the raindrop (again only a portion is reflected) so that the angle of incidence equals the angle of reflection. A portion of the light then exits the raindrop, and once again the angles are governed by Snell s Law.  The total amount of (clockwise) rotation in this process is called the deviation angle , denoted . This is shown in the sketch above.    Show that .    Remember that the angles and are not independent. They are related by Snell s Law which we will rewrite as where is called index of refraction (for water). In the case of white light, this index of refraction is about (This is an average. actually varies with the frequency (color) of the light.). Graphing for and gives the graph below.              From this graph it appears that the minimum of the curve is approximately at the point . So the minimum value of is about and it occurs when the angle at which the light enters the raindrop is . Notice (from the enlargement of the graph near that minimum) that because the graph of is nearly horizontal (This is Fermat s Theorem coming into play again.) for values of near the amount of deviation is roughly the same for those values of .  This is pertinent because it means that the lower the deviation angle the more concentrated that light rays exiting the raindrop. So the light rays entering the raindrop at approximately have the highest concentration when exiting the raindrop. At other values of the light is more diffused. It is these concentrated light rays that we see as a rainbow.  The angle supplementary to is called the rainbow angle , denoted . Thus            The rainbow angle is also the angle that the rainbow makes with the eye of an observer, relative to the angle of the sun. For white light we have a rainbow angle of as seen below.   So you will see a rainbow when the air is filled with water droplets, for example immediately after a rain, and the sun is behind you. Relative to the sun s rays the angle from your eye to the top of the rainbow will be about . Every droplet reflects and refracts each ray of light entering it. The aggregation of all of those rays is the rainbow.  Of course, rainbows will manifest under other circumstances too, but we have not analyzed those.    The Colors of the Rainbow                The color spread in a rainbow occurs because the index of refraction , changes with the frequency (color) of the light. This can be seen by shining a beam of light through a triangular prism or, by listening to rock music from the 1970s.   Of course we can only do so much by reasoning from graphs and pictures. If we want to nail things down very precisely (we do), we will eventually need to look at the problem analytically by minimizing an objective function. Fortunately, we already have our objective function. It is . Our constraint comes from Snell s Law, . We said that the general parameter would depend on the frequency of the light and we ve observed that for water and air . Rather than graphing the function for different values of we ll just leave it as an arbitrary constant while we calculate. Afterward we can substitute specific values as needed.    Differentiate the objective function, , and the constraint, equation , and use Fermat s Theorem to show that when is a minimum     Combining equation with our constraint, we see that we need to solve the following system of two equations in two unknowns,   Normally to solve such a system, we would use one of the equations to eliminate one of the variables in the other equation. We could do that here but it would require some very messy expressions involving inverse trigonometric functions. Instead there is a trick that will be cleaner.  Suppose we square the quantities in each equation and then add the resulting equations together. This gives You might want to file this trick away in your memory. When Trigonometry is involved it is a good idea to look for, or to create, sums of the squares of sines and cosines.        Use equation to show that for a given index of refraction , is minimized when and .    Use the result in part to complete the following table:    Color   (in degrees)  (in degrees)   (in degrees)   (in degrees)    Red 1.331       Orange 1.332       Yellow 1.333       Green 1.335       Blue 1.337       Indigo 1.340       Violet 1.344                      How does the table in part explain the order of the colors in the primary rainbow?                            The values of you obtained in the table account for the various color bands that appear in the rainbow as sunlight hits droplets at various angles.    Double Rainbows             In a double rainbow the primary rainbow is created from light entering the upper portion of the droplet and exiting from the bottom. If light is bright enough then a secondary rainbow is created from light entering the lower portion and exiting the upper portion of the droplet as in the diagram below.   For the secondary rainbow the deviation angle is the total amount of counterclockwise rotation and the rainbow angle would be . Note that the extra reflection explains why the secondary rainbow is not as bright as the primary.          Show that in the case of the secondary rainbow, . This is our objective function for the secondary rainbow.    Show that is minimized when and .    Use part to complete the following table:    Color   (in degrees)  (in degrees)   (in degrees)   (in degrees)    Red 1.331       Orange 1.332       Yellow 1.333       Green 1.335       Blue 1.337       Indigo 1.340       Violet 1.344                      Use the table in part of this problem and the table in part of to explain why the secondary rainbow is above the primary rainbow and its colors are reversed.                                  Global vs. Local Extrema  So far in this chapter we ve relied heavily on our intuition. For instance, in Example it was very clear that a minimal square exists. Moreover, when we differentiated the objective function we found that was the only solution of . So it was reasonable to conclude that the minimum occurs when .  Similarly in Problem it was intuitively clear that there was both a maximal and a minimal square, so when we found two solutions of it made sense to conclude that they correspond to the maximal and minimal squares, respectively.  Unfortunately things are rarely this straightforward. Consider the following example.   Constructing a Square on a Parabola  We would like to find the area of the smallest square which can be constructed with one corner at the point and an adjacent corner on the graph of . This example is very similar to Problem or Problem so we will proceed in much the same way. The objective function is the same but this time the constraint is   In our previous examples we began by differentiating both the objective function and the constraint. This time substitute the constraint into to obtain the objective function in terms of a single variable. We make this change of strategy simply to demonstrate that the two procedures are equivalent. In fact, for this particular problem they are almost identical. For more complex problems you may find that you prefer one strategy or the other.    Show that when , and . Getting three distinct solutions of is quite unexpected in light of our previous work. Can you explain what s going on here?        To find the minimal square in we need only substitute the -values into . We get    From these numbers, and from the sketch above we can see that the minimal square seems to be the one whose second corner lies on the parabola at the point (approximately) . But those other two solutions of are troubling. Do we get a maximal square at since is the largest value of among the three we ve identified. And what about the point ? We clearly get neither a minimum nor a maximum there. Why did our solution procedure point to it? This is all very puzzling.       To begin addressing these questions let s look at the graph of our objective function, .   The first coordinate of each point on the graph at the left corresponds to the -coordinate of the corner of a square which lies on the constraint, , and the second coordinate on the graph is the area of that square. Thus the minimal square will correspond to the lowest point on the graph at the left which is the square with a second corner at as we have already concluded. But since the graph at the left continues to rise as we look farther to the right (or left) it should also be clear that there is no maximal square.  This graph also explains the why our procedure identified the squares with a second corner at both and as possible minimal squares as well. When we solve we are locating the points on the graph of our objective function where its derivative is zero. That is, where the slope of the line tangent is horizontal. Fermat s Theorem only assures us that if has an extremum at then . In particular it does not tell us that there are no other values of where .       The problem here is that we have not been precise in our language. When we say maximum (or minimum) in ordinary speech we mean the largest one, and it is clear that there can only be one largest.    Comment  Although the largest value can occur more than once, at different places. Think about the graph of . At every value of where there is a maximum.    However, if we confine our attention to the part of the graph inside the blue rectangle above we see that the point at is a minimum locally and the point at is a maximum locally . By locally we mean if we restrict our attention to the graph near those two points as seen at the right. We will need to distinguish between local and global optima in the future.  There are other issues as well.  Recall from Digression: The Tangent Function Has No Inverse that a function has two parts:   A rule to associate input with output, and    A domain.   Change either of these and you have a different function.  In this example our objective function is and the constraint is But suppose we change the constraint to so that the domain is just the part of the real line inside the blue rectangle above.  We now have a different problem because the only part of the graph we are interested in is the piece inside the blue rectangle. The global minimum no longer occurs at because is not in the problem domain, simply doesn t exist in the domain of the function , with domain; . However, since and are in the domain they still correspond to a local maximum and a local minimum, respectively. Are they also the global maximum and minimum? Give this question some thought and take your best guess. We will return to it in .       The existence of local extrema really complicates things for us because it means we have to find all of the local extrema and then figure out which of them, if any, are global. If we don t get organized we re likely to have a lot of trouble keeping this all straight.   In the sketch above is the global minimum of since it is the lowest point on the graph of , whereas is a local minimum because it is the lowest point on the graph when the domain of is restricted to the interval (between the dashed lines). In this sketch the global maximum of occurs at the endpoints of the interval, and . The fact that extrema can also occur at endpoints is another complicating detail we will come back to shortly.  Since the domain of the function affects the location of the extrema a definition of extrema will need to reference the function s domain. It is easy to get lost in the technicalities so keep in mind as we proceed.  We have the following definitions.   Global Minimum   Suppose that is a number in the domain of such that for every in the domain of . Then is the global minimum of .     Mathematical Terminology  The phrase such that is a term of art in mathematics. It means, with the following property.      Provide a definition of Global Maximum modeled on .    To define local extrema we need the concept of an open interval, so we digress briefly.   DIGRESSION: Interval Notation  Digression Interval Notation    An interval is a contiguous set of real numbers. For example, the set of numbers strictly between zero and one is an interval. Because the endpoints are not included it is called an open interval and is denoted by . Think of this notation as an abbreviation of the the two inequalities (This is also abbreviated sometimes as .)  Be careful. This notation can be ambiguous. Without some context it is not clear whether the notation represents the open interval satisfying the inequalities , or the point in the - plane.  If we include the endpoints we have a closed interval , denoted by the ordered pair . Think of this as an abbreviated form of the two inequalities (This is also abbreviated sometimes as .)  Re-express each of the following intervals using inequalities and state whether it is open, closed, or neither.                       Re-express each of the following intervals using inequalities and state whether it is open, closed, or neither.                                 If we want to identify the interval of all numbers greater than, say there is no right endpoint of the interval. Rather than writing this out in words every time we encounter it (which will be often) we force our notation to adapt to our need and denote this interval as: . Similarly the interval of all numbers less than or equal to is denoted: . We ve been using the symbol to denote all real numbers, but since the set of all real numbers is a (very large) interval we will sometimes use the interval notation, as well.  Do not be fooled by this. Infinity ( ) is not a number and cannot be treated like one. This is just a notational shorthand that we use for our own convenience.   END OF DIGRESSION   Now we can define local extrema.   Local Minimum    Suppose that is a number in the domain of . Then is a local minimum of if there is an open interval, , such that for every in the interval and in the domain of .      Provide a definition of Local Maximum modeled on .     Explain why we can find a global maximum (minimum) by finding all of the local maxima (minima) and selecting the largest (smallest) among these.     Optimization, the Abstract Problem   As we saw in once we ve found the objective function, , our optimization problem becomes the more abstract problem of finding the extreme points of the graph of . An optimization problem ultimately comes down to finding all of the local extrema. The maximum among those will be the global maximum, and the minimum among those will be the global minimum. Assuming of course, that either exists.  Thus our first task is to identify all of the local extrema. But finding the local extreme points of the graph of an arbitrary objective function can be more complicated than we ve seen in any of our examples so far. In this section we will address these complications. By the end of the section we will have a general procedure for solving this more abstract optimization problem.    Identifying and Distinguishing Maxima and Minima  Use your favorite graphing utility to graph the function and confirm visually that it has a local maximum at , and a local minimum at . This seems to be easy to do when we have the graph in front of us. But in the absence of a graph how could we tell which is the maximum and which is the minimum?  Sometimes even having the graph isn t much help. For example, see if you can visually identify the global maximum and global minimum of the graph of   We ll need an analytic method; one that doesn t rely on pictures. To that end, consider the following theorem from elementary Algebra.   Theorem First Derivative Test for Straight Lines     If a line has positive slope then the coordinate increases as the coordinate increases.    If a line has negative slope then the coordinate decreases as the coordinate increases.      Lines are easy to think about of course, because the slope of a line is constant. If the slope of a line is here, then it is also over there, and way back there too. But we know that the slope of a curve can change from point to point so we will need to generalize Theorem to a statement about curves. generalizes to curves as follows.   Comment  This is a rather naive statement of this theorem, but it will suffice for our current purposes. We will revisit, restate, and prove the First Derivative Test in Section     The First Derivative Test  Theorem First Derivative Test  Suppose is a function of . The following statements are true:   If , on some interval then is increasing on the interval.    If , on some interval then is decreasing on the interval.      The First Derivative test is precisely the tool we need to distinguish a maximum from a minimum. It will also turn out to be the tool that will allow us to determine via computation, rather than intuition, if a given objective function has a maximum or minimum. Take a moment to think about how this might be done before reading further.    Transition Points, and Possible Transition Points on Open Intervals  For the moment notice that we are confining our attention to functions whose domains are open intervals.  From Theorem we see that if the derivative of is positive then is increasing and if the derivative of is negative then is decreasing. So, at a maximum will transition from increasing to decreasing, and will transition from positive to negative. We conclude that to find a maximum we need to find those places where the derivative transitions from positive to negative.  Similarly, to find a local minimum, we need to find a place where the derivative transitions from negative to positive. We call such points optimal transition points because they are the places where (local) optima must occur.  The simplest way for to make either transition is for it to pass through zero. Thus the solutions of are possible optimal transition points (POTPs) because these are points where and optimum might occur. This is not guaranteed.  In the simplest case all we have to do is find the solutions of , then determine the sign of the derivative on either side of each such point. If it changes then we have a local extremum.      In the paragraph above we used the phrase in the simplest case. We chose our words carefully. Can you think of another way for to transition from positive to negative, or from negative to positive? Give this some thought. We will come back to it.   The POTPs which are solutions of are the easiest to think about and work with so we will focus on those for now. Unfortunately, extrema can sometimes occur at other points as well. We will address that possibility once we have thoroughly examined this simpler case.   Let . The solutions of are and so these are the POTPs. Sketch the graph of and follow along with our reasoning below, confirming our conclusions visually.  To determine if they actually are transition points we proceed as follows:   At :  Pick a number less than , say Since we see that is increasing to the left of Next pick a number between and the next POTP, . We ll take . Since we see that is decreasing to the right of . Thus is a local maximum value of .    At :  As we saw above is decreasing to the left of since . (Zero is between and .) Next choose any number to the right of . We ll choose . Since we see that is increasing to the right of . Thus is a local minimum of .     In this example we only tested one number between adjacent POTPs. Is that enough? Give this some thought before reading on.  Of course it is. Consider that the POTPs are precisely those places where might change sign. Therefore the sign of must either be always positive or always negative in between POTPs. Therefore, we only need to test at one value of to find the sign of on the entire interval between POTPs.  If is the greatest POTP we need only test the sign of one number greater than to determine the sign of for every value of greater than .  Similarly, if is the least POTP we need only test the sign of one number less than to determine the sign of for every value of less than .  We state all of this formally in below.    Does the graph of have a global maximum or minimum? Explain.    Let be a differentiable function.   Suppose and are two POTPs of such that there is not another POTP between them. If for some in the domain of between and , then for every in the domain of between and . Similarly, if for some between and , then for every in the domain of between and .    Suppose is the greatest POTP of . If for some then for all , in the domain of .    Suppose is the least POTP of . If for some then for all , in the domain of .      In mathematics Theorems and Lemmas are always stated very formally, very concisely, and with as much generality as possible. There are good reasons for this but it does sometimes make them hard to read.   Read Lemma very carefully and convince yourself that it really does say the same thing as our conclusions at the end of .   Remember that POTPs are possible optimal transition points. The existence of a POTP does not imply the existence of an optimum, as the next example demonstrates.   Find all extrema of the graph of .  Solving we see that is the only POTP. But elsewhere (confirm this) so is positive for every value of except zero. In particular it is positive on the left and on the right of zero. Therefore never transitions between increasing and decreasing, so we conclude that it does not have an extremum at , despite the fact that . This may seem very curious until you graph the function.    Sketch the graph of and use it to explain how we can have yet not have either a maximum or a minimum at .    Constructing a Parabola on a Square, Revisited  Given our new understanding of the distinction between local and global extrema we will revisit . The objective function is still so when we substitute the constraint, , we get the abstract problem of finding the lowest points on the graph of   Solving gives us three POTPs: , , and as before, so the intervals we need are, , , , and . Because our POTPs are approximations these intervals are also approximate.  Now pretend that you don t already know the solution of this problem. Just as in we can use the First Derivative Test to determine which of the POTPs we ve identified corresponds to a local minimum or maximum.    For the objective function choose a point in each interval and confirm that the following statements are true.   On the (approximate) interval :     On the (approximate) interval :     On the (approximate) interval :     On the (approximate) interval :       Use the First Derivative Test and the data in part to show that there is a local minimum at a local maximum at and a local minimum at .    Is the data in part sufficient to support the conclusion that there is a global minimum at ? Explain why not.    What additional data do we need to conclude that there is a global minimum at ?                                           Identify all possible optimal transition points, and identify the intervals on which each function is increasing and decreasing. Label each possible optimal transition point as a local or global minimum, or a local or global maximum, or neither.                                                              Undefined Derivatives   Happy families are all alike; every unhappy family is unhappy in its own way.   Leo Tolstoy (1847 )    In we asked if you think of a way for to transition from positive to negative, or from negative to positive without passing through zero. Clearly this is possible, otherwise we would not have asked. But it s hard to see how this can be isn t it? After all, at a transition point the derivative of the objective function changes signs: It transitions from negative-to-positive or from positive-to-negative. Obviously, the only number that has positive numbers on one side and negative numbers on the other is zero. So won t the solutions of give us all of the possible transition points?   No, they won t. We can also have a transition point wherever is meaningless. That is, when is undefined . below demonstrates one way in which a derivative might be undefined.    Suppose The graph of looks like this:     Show that is undefined.   Recall Digression: Dividing by Zero.    Graph to verify that when .                 Based on it would be easy to conclude that the derivative of can only be undefined at a point where the formula for requires that we divide by zero. But this conclusion is due to the poverty of our experience with non-differentiabilty.  There are many ways that a function can fail to be differentiable at a point. Dividing by zero is only one of them. In many ways it is the simplest. The family of non-differentiable functions is a very unhappy family, indeed. We might even call it dysfunctional.  The functions whose graphs are shown below is a representative sample of functions which are non-differentiable at . Can you see what they all have in common?\\\\    In our comments just before we stated that the Principle of Local Linearity is exactly what makes Calculus useful and we have relied on that truth in all of our subsequent investigations. But there is more to it than that. The Principle of Local Linearity is not only what makes Differential Calculus useful, its what makes Differential Calculus possible.       Take another look at graph (a) above, . Do you see that the Principle of Local Linearity is not in play near the point ? No matter how much we zoom in on this point the graph will never resemble a straight line, any straight line. It looks like the sketch below at every scale.   The same is true of every function given above. They all violate the Principle of Local Linearity. Near none of them looks like a straight line no matter what viewing scale we use.  The case of a vertical tangent line is slightly problematic because near the graph of, for example, looks like a vertical straight line. But the derivative of is so it is not differentiable at zero, which is the point: Any point where a given function is not differentiable is a POTP.  We formalize this observation with the following definition.   Possible Optimal Transition Points (POTPs)    The possible optimum transition points of a function, , come in two categories:   Any point, , where is a possible optimal transition point.    Any point, , where is not defined is a possible optimal transition point.       For each function identify all POTPs , and identify the intervals on which the function is increasing and decreasing. Label each POTP as a local or global minimum, maximum, or neither. (For some of these you will have to rely on their graphs to find the POTPs. In you will learn how to find them with computation.)                                                                                        Transition Points on a Closed Interval; the Problem of Endpoints  Real world optimization problems will have a natural domain on which the objective function is defined. It is pointless to consider values of outside of that domain. We actually saw this in Example , although we didn t remark on it at the time. Recall that in Example we needed to optimize the area of a square with one of its corners on the unit circle: Obviously it makes no sense to consider any value of greater than or less than (why not?), so the natural domain of this problem is .  When the natural domain of a problem is a closed interval (one that includes both endpoints) it is possible that an extremum might also occur at one of those endpoints.              For example, suppose we need to optimize the function, From the graph below we can see that this function has a global minimum at . We can find this minimum by the methods we are already familiar with. But it also has a local maximum at and global maximum at , and nothing we ve done so far would identify these two points as possible extrema.   It is clear from the graph what is happening, though. If we hadn t restricted the domain of our function then the graph would continue to rise on both sides and there would be no local or global maximum at all. The restriction on the domain forces the graph to stop rising at the endpoints of the interval which makes each of these endpoints a local maximum.  Thus we see that when the domain of our function is a closed interval there is also the possibility that a local or global extremum might occur at the endpoints of the interval as well. As a result, when searching for extrema we must always check the endpoints of the domain interval (if there are any).  To be clear, the end points of a closed interval are not transition points because there can be no transition between increasing and decreasing at an endpoint. It simply stops. However, since it is possible to have extrema at the endpoints they must also be checked whenever they are in play.  Be careful. When the domain of a function is artificially constrained like this it is easy to forget that the constraint is present. We tend to think of it as not really there. This is a mistake. Recall from Digression: The Tangent Function Has No Inverse that the definition of the domain is a part of the definition of a function. Think of the function s domain as the universe for that particular problem. Nothing exists outside of the domain. Thus in this example nothing exists outside of the interval (universe) .   It appears that to find global extrema for a function whose domain consists entirely of closed intervals all we need to do is   Find the POTPs.    Evaluate our objective function at the POTPs and at any end    Determine which among those is greatest and which is least.     And that s it. When the domain of our function is a closed interval (or the union of closed intervals) optimization really is that straightforward\\aside{Remember that straightforward does not mean easy. }.  We formalize all of this in Theorem below.   Extreme Value Theorem  Theorem Extreme Value Theorem  If is a continuous function whose domain consists entirely of closed, bounded intervals then:   There is at least one point in the domain, say such that is the global maximum value of . Moreover will either be an end point of one of the domain intervals, or an optimal transition point.    There is least one point in the domain, say , and is the global minimum of . Moreover will either be an end point of one of the domain intervals, or optimal transition point.        We ended after posing the problem of finding the global extrema of with the constraint Solve this problem now.          Notice that has no extrema on Explain why this does not violate the Extreme Value Theorem.    Notice that has no extrema on Explain why this does not violate the Extreme Value Theorem.              If we had known Theorem when we first looked at it would have saved us some time. Redo , using the knowledge that the domain of the problem is because the constraint is       Find the global maximum and global minimum of each function with the domain restricted to the given intervals. Verify your solution by graphing the function.                                                                                                                                                       Find the global maximum and global minimum of each of the following functions with domains on the given intervals. Verify your solution with graphing software.     on the interval        on the interval          on the interval        on the interval        on the interval        on the interval        on the interval        on the interval        on the interval        on the interval        on the interval        on the interval        on the interval        on the interval          on the interval        on the interval          on the interval          on the interval        on the interval        on the interval                                             For each of the following functions defined on closed, bounded intervals, find the maximum and minimum of the function on that interval.                                                   Concavity and the Second Derivative Test   The Second Derivative Test   Theorem explicitly assumed that the domain of our function consisted of closed (and bounded) intervals. This assumption was crucial. Without this assumption even simple functions that you would expect to have extrema do not.   For example, suppose our objective function is , and that the domain is the open interval . Do you see why the graph of this function has no extrema of any kind? If not here is one way to prove it.    Observe that . Therefore is always increasing on . If is any number between and then can t be a maximum (minimum) because any number just to the right (left) of will give us an that is higher (lower) than . Can we always find a number just to the right of without leaving the interval Sure. Just take the number halfway between and        Show that the function also has no minimum on the open interval .   This leaves us with a dilemma: If the domain is not closed and bounded we can t rely on the Extreme Value Theorem to guarantee the existence of extrema. In fact shows that there might not be any extrema. But if there are we d still like to be able to find them.  This is a problem but it is not an insurmountable problem. In fact we already have most of the tools we need. It is still true that local extrema, if they exist, can only occur at optimal transition points or at endpoints. So finding these is still the first step.   For this example we strongly suggest that you do not graph the objective functions first. Yes, we know this goes directly against our previous advice to always visualize your problem when you can, but one purpose of this section is for you to learn to analyze a problem using your Calculus tools. Much as an airline pilot must train to fly using only the cockpit instruments in case they have no other choice due to poor visibility, you should also practice flying blind so you can be successful even when you are not able to draw a useful graph. You will learn more, and you will learn better, that way.  Of course, once we ve moved beyond this section you should visualize your problem if you possibly can. We weren t kidding about that. You don t want to fly blind, you just need to be able to when it is necessary.  From the information gethered in Drill: can we conclude that either or has a global maximum at and a global minimum at ?  No we can t. They both have a local maximum and minimum at those points since both functions increase on , decrease on , and then increase again on . But from the information we have gathered so far we can t tell if the graph of either function rises above its value at or drops below its value at .  When we analyze and using the First Derivative Test we get exactly the same information from both functions. But they are very different functions. In particular, does not have any global extrema, while has both a global maximum and a global minimum. Graph them now and see. To distinguish, analytically, between and we will need a new tool called the Second Derivative Test.  But before we leave this example we need to address a small issue with our language. The phrase gets farther from zero in the negative (or positive) direction so does is awkward\\aside{It is also a bit imprecise for our purposes.}. In future examples we will instead usually abbreviate these as: as goes to negative (or positive) infinity, also goes to negative (or positive) infinity. Do not invest too much in these phrases. They cannot possibly mean what they pretend to mean. Infinity is neither a number nor a place so it is meaningless to say that  goes to infinity. Think of this as a kind of verbal shorthand, or notation.         Suppose that .   Show that the POTPs are and .    Show that is increasing on , decreasing on , and increasing again on .       Suppose that . Show that is increasing on , decreasing on , and increasing again on .                                    Just as the First Derivative Test tells us whether the graph of a function is increasing or decreasing, the Second Derivative Test tells us whether the graph is concave upward or concave downward . We need to begin by explaining the meaning of the phrases concave upward and concave downward .   The graphs above are illuminative. Loosely speaking concave upward means like a bowl that opens up, and concave downward means like a bowl that opens down. However it is easy to get the wrong impression from these simple examples. The graphs of the natural exponential and the natural logarithm (seen below) are also concave upward and concave downward, respectively. This is true despite the fact that the exponential never turns up on the left, and the logarithm never turns down on the right.         Nor is every graph always concave up or concave down. We can see from its graph below that the sine function is both concave upward and concave downward. On the interval it is concave downward and on the interval it is concave upward. The concavity of a graph, like the property of increasing and decreasing, depends on the interval we are looking at.   Now what about these two functions?    The graph on the right appears to be concave up everywhere, but is it? Can you tell from the graph what the concavity of either function is near ? If it is important for us to distinguish concave upward from concave downward (it is), then clearly we will need a more precise method than simply looking at graphs. We ll proceed carefully.       Since we re studying Calculus it seems likely that the derivative will play an instrumental role, so let s see what we can say about the derivative of a function whose graph is concave upward as shown below.   In this example notice how the slope of the line tangent to the graph (the derivative) changes as increases. At the tangent line is horizontal (slope is zero), to the left of the tangent line has negative slope and to the right it has positive slope. Speaking loosely, when the graph of a function is concave up its the derivative increases as increases.   Does that mean that the derivative of a concave downward function will decrease as increases? Yes, of course it does. Look back at the graphs of the other concave up and concave down examples and convince yourself that this is true of them as well.   Apparently in order to distinguish where a function is concave upward from where it is concave downward we need to locate those intervals where the derivative is increasing and where it is decreasing. That is, we need a tool that tells when some function (the derivative function in this case) is increasing and when it is decreasing.  But we already have that tool! It s called the First Derivative Test.  To find out where the graph of is concave upward or concave downward, we ask where its derivative, , is increasing and where it is decreasing. To find out where is increasing and decreasing we ask where its derivative, , is positive and where it is negative.  The function will be increasing (meaning that is concave upward) wherever its derivative, , is positive. It will be decreasing ( is concave downward) wherever its derivative, , is negative.  So, to determine concavity of , we need to look at the sign of its second derivative, . More formally we have the following theorem.   Concavity  Theorem Concavity  Suppose is a differentiable function of The following statements are true:   If on some open interval then is increasing, and therefore the graph of is concave upward on the interval.    If , on some open interval then is decreasing, and therefore the graph of is concave downward on the same interval.       Let Then and Since the second derivative of is always positive the graph must always be concave upward.    Graph and verify that it is always concave upward.    Let Then and Since the second derivative of is negative on the interval the graph must be concave downward on for . Since the second derivative of is positive on the interval the graph must be concave upward for .    Graph and verify that it is always concave downward on the interval , and concave upward on the interval .   Because we are applying the First Derivative Test to the first derivative of our language necessarily gets a little complex here. The point to remember is that we are ultimately interested in what the first two derivatives, and , tell us about the graph of . We will define some vocabulary to help us keep all of this clear.  We called the solutions of possible optimal transition points (POTPs) because these are the places where the graph of might transition between increasing and decreasing. So they are possible local optimal points.  We will call the solutions of possible inflective transition points (PITPs) because they are those places where the inflection of the graph of might transition between concave upward and concave downward.    Suppose that .    Show that the PITPs of are , and .    Show that the graph of is concave upward on the intervals and .    Show that the graph of is concave downward on the interval . In particular notice that is concave downward at .                  Part (c) of displays a very useful fact about the second derivative. At the first derivative of is equal to zero, which means that the line tangent at zero is horizontal. Also at the second derivative is negative, which means that at the graph is concave downward. Taking these two facts together we can conclude that must have a (local) maximum at   That is, for any curve , if then must have a (local) maximum at . Similarly, for any curve , if then must have a (local) minimum at         Use the observation in the previous paragraph to show that the graph of has local minima at , and at .    What is the value of the minima (the value) of at each , and ?                 We formalize this idea in the Second Derivative Test, stated below.   The Second Derivative Test  Theorem Second Derivative Test   Suppose is some differentiable function and that at some point in its domain Then the following statements are true:   If then has a local minimum at     If then has a local maximum at     If then we get no information about possible extrema of at .      Use the Second Derivative Test to find the local maxima and minima of each function. Also identify any global maxima and minima.                          on        on        on                   As you saw in when the Second Derivative Test works it can make quick work of many optimization problems. But unfortunately part (c) of Theorem is its Achilles heel . It is surprisingly common for both the first and second derivative to be equal to zero at a POTP. When this happens the Second Derivative Test cannot tell us whether we are at an optimal point or not, so we have to fall back on the First Derivative Test and analyze the intervals between the the POTPs.  Analyze the concavity of the graphs of each of the following functions.                                             Identify all intervals where the given curve is concave upward, concave downward, increasing, and decreasing. Identify all local optima, and all global optima, if any. Graph the curve to check your work after you have solved each problem.                                                                                                                                                           Show that has    both a global and a local minimum if its domain is the interval , and    only a local minimum if its domain is the interval .    Does the graph of this function have a global maximum for either of the domains given in parts (a) or (b)? Explain.                  Does have a global extremum (minimum or maximum) on the interval ? How about on ? On ? Explain.    Use the First Derivative Test.      Suppose that and that the domain of the problem is all real numbers ( ).    Find all local extrema.    Find all global extrema.               Consider the polynomial .    Show that    You can save yourself a lot of work on this problem by keeping your eye on the goal. The problem is to show that , not to compute and then simplify it.    Graph near to convince yourself that has neither a maximum nor a minimum at .                As we ve said before, Calculus is merely one tool in your problem solving toolbox. Moreover it is almost never the first tool you should reach for. You will frequently need to use your skills with Algebra, Geometry, or Trigonometry to transform a problem into a form which allows you to bring Calculus to bear on it. You will need to take it slowly, think clearly, and be careful. Frequently you will find that your first first few ideas aren t working. When that happens, find another idea and start again.  On the other hand you will often have a good deal of insight into real-world problems because they are, well, real-world problems, and you understand a lot about the real world.     Optimization Problems   So far in this chapter the examples and problems we ve chosen we ve chosen emphasized the different aspects of optimization. Our intention was to show you the subtleties involved one at a time so you could understand them separately.  Of course, this is entirely unrealistic. Real problems rarely tell you where the difficulties will lie, so in this final section we offer you a selection of problems. It is up to you to     Find an appropriate objective function.    Identify the constraints.    Decide whether the natural domain of the problem consists closed intervals or not.    Identify any POTPs. If the problem domain consists only of closed intervals use the Extreme Value . Otherwise use the First Derivative Test or the Second Derivative Test .    Identify which, if any, of the POTPs are global optima.    Re-read the problem and confirm that you have solved it.  This is a more important step than it sounds. When the problems are complex it is easy to lose track of the actual question and stop too soon, or go to far. Always make sure you have solved the problem stated and not some nearby problem..     Recall that in we observed that most people can see intuitively that of all rectangles with a fixed perimeter the one that encloses the greatest area will be a square. We gave an algebraic demonstration of this in Chapter but now that we know how to use Calculus to optimize let s revisit this problem.   revisited again   We first solved this problem algebraically in . In we solved it again analytically (that is, using Calculus) using Fermat s Theorem. But Fermat s Theorem only allows us to find a maximum that we already know exists. Since we did not have the tools necessary to show that we actually had a maximum, we relied on our intuition and assumed that a maximum existed. We will solve this problem one last time, showing that there must be a maximum this time.  Show that of all rectangles with a fixed perimeter, , the one with the greatest area is a square.    We will follow the outline above.     The objective function is      The only constraint is where is constant.    Since we are talking about a length it must be that . From equation we see that must be less that or equal to . Otherwise the perimeter will be greater than . So the domain of our problem is .   Comment  Strictly speaking if or we don t actually have a rectangle. But it is simpler to use the Extreme Value Theorem ( ) than to find the increasing and decreasing intervals using the First Derivative Test. Since the Extreme Value Theorem requires a closed domain we make things simpler by allowing zero width (or height) rectangles.     Since the problem domain is a closed interval we will use the Extreme Value Theorem ( ). To find the POTPs we will need . From equation we see that   From equation we have and also   Combining equation , equation , and equation we see that The only solution of is , so the POTPs for this problem are the end points, and , and .    The area, , will be zero when and when (why?) so by the Extreme Value Theorem the maximum occurs when .    This problem asks us to show that the maximal rectangle must be a square, so we need to show that . We know that the maximum occurs when . Plugging this value into equation we see that is also equal to . Thus the maximal rectangle is a square as stated.                                                                                                 In we were careful to follow the steps we listed at the beginning of this section in the sequence given. That list is helpful. That s why we wrote it out. However, it would be a mistake to think of it as a recipe to be followed blindly. Think of it as an outline. An outline is a guide, not a recipe and it is not necessary to follow it rigidly, step-by-step. If you find it simpler to do these steps in a different order for some problem there is no reason that you shouldn t. But before you declare the problem solved look back at this outline and make sure that you have done everything that needs to be done. This is what an outline is for.  In in Chapter we considered the related problem of minimizing the perimeter when the area is fixed. The following problem asks you to solve this problem using Calculus. Notice that just as above we have and but this time is constant, not .    Out of all rectangles with a fixed area, find the dimensions of the one with the smallest perimeter.    Identify the objective function and the constraint for this problem.    Find the natural domain of this problem and show that it is not a closed interval.    Show that we have a POTP when .    Show that when we have a minimum by:   Using the first derivative test.    Using the second derivative test.   Note that both tests will require you to use the constraint to reduce the number of variables in the objective to one. Which test was easier to use?                                  Redo from Chapter using Calculus. Verify that you get the same answer as before.    The following example demonstrates how different approaches to the same problem can lead to different challenges. In this case just changing the labels on the diagram makes a big difference.    Two Ways to Optimize   The pages of a book are to have an area of square centimeters. The side and bottom margins are to be centimeter in width and the top margin is to be centimeter in width.  Find the dimensions of the page that has the largest possible printed area, .    First Solution:        This problem can be visualized as in the diagram above. Since it is the printed area that is to be maximized it seems natural to label the width of the printed area, , and the height, , as shown. If we call the printed area then our objective function is,   The width of the entire page will be , and the height will be . The area of each page is constrained to be square centimeters so our constraint is, Differentiating equation we see that Solving equation for we have Differentiating equation and solving for gives Substituting these into equation we have Since we ll have to set this equal to zero and to find any POTPs it is clearly in our interest to reduce this algebraically to Adding the fractions we see that we must solve At this point it is tempting to expand , but recall that our goal is to solve for . Multiplying through by gives so that    Comment  You can simplify  to if you like, but there is no real advantage to doing so. We prefer to leave it as .   Solving this last equation gives . But the width of a page can t be negative so a negative solution is meaningless for this problem. Thus is our one and only POTP, and we conclude that we can maximize the printed area by taking centimeters.  That was a lot of work but we are not finished The problem asks us to find the dimensions (plural) of the page. To find we use equation to compute   But we re still not finished. The problem asks for the dimensions of the page, but we ve only found the dimensions of the printed area. The dimensions of the page are   Finally, the last item in our outline says to make sure we have done everything that needs to be done to solve the problem. Have we?  No, clearly not. We never did step . As a result we don t know for certain that we have a maximum. It may be that the critical point we ve identified is not in the problem domain. It may be that it is in the domain, but that we have a minimum instead of a maximum. Or that we have neither. The point is that we can t know until we have found the natural domain of the objective function, and verified that there is a global maximum at centimeters.  We mentioned earlier that the width of the page can t be negative so the smallest possible value of , the left endpoint of our interval, is zero.    Show that the largest possible value of is and thus the natural domain for this problem is the closed interval .    Show that the maximal printed area occurs when .              Second Solution  There is often more than one objective function that will work for any given problem. If your first attempt does not seem to be working --- even if you are sure you have an objective that will work --- you always have the option of going back to the beginning and trying to find another valid objective function.  For our second solution we will use the same diagram, but with different labeling. As you can see at the left, this time we ve let and represent, respectively, the width and height of the page rather than of the printed area.        Our objective function is still the area of the printed portion of the page, but with the updated labeling this becomes   Differentiating this we have The constraint is still that the area of the page is square centimeters, but this is now given by Differentiating the constraint gives from which we see that . From equation we see that . Substituting these into equation we get   Setting this equal to zero and solving for gives As before, we know that the width of a page cannot be negative so the only POTP is .  This time and represent the width and height of the page, so the width of the printed text is will be as before. Similarly the height of the printed text will be .   Determine the natural domain of and show that is a global maximum when . Do you get the same page dimensions as before?   You will find that, quite often, simplifying complex expressions as much as possible with Algebra, Geometry, or Trigonometry will lead to easier Calculus computations. Conversely less non-Calculus work often leads to more challenging differentiations. But this is not a hard-and-fast rule. Sometimes you will find that leaving the formulas you generate unsimplified gives better insight into the problem, making things a little simpler overall, even if it makes the differentiation quite onerous.  Which parts of a given problem you find easy or difficult will depend on your skill level with your tools. With experience comes the ability to balance the workload across your skills. When you realize that one approach will lead to a complication that you know you will find difficult to handle, it can be beneficial to stop and look for another approach. If you find one, stop and try again from the beginning.  Then identify where your skill is lacking and give yourself some practice with that particular skill to improve your skills overall. Review, practice, and improve your Algebra, Geometry, and Trigonometry skills as needed.  A common mistake when abandoning a first attempt is to try to preserve and reuse computations left over from your first try. But that attempt didn t work. You need to try something new.

We can imagine the blue square growing and shrinking as we move the point along the line. It seems clear that the square having the least area is the one pictured in black (when is at . It is worth taking a moment to notice this explicitly because not all optimization problems are solvable. If we had asked for the largest possible square there would be no solution because the blue square in our diagram can always be make larger by moving the point further to the left on the graph of equation .  But a convincing picture is not a solution. To complete the solution we ll need to compute the coordinates of the point in our sketch and compute the minimal area.  In any optimization problem the first question to ask is, What do we need to optimize? In other words, What is our objective function? For this problem the length of the line segment between the point and any point is given by the Distance Formula: . Therefore the area of the square constructed from this line segment is given by the function: So our objective function is . Since the point is constrained to lie on the line , equation , is our constraint.  Notice that we ve abused our notation a bit. Although the notation indicates that depends on alone, we ve given in terms of both and . But solving equation gives so it should be clear that really depends only on .   Comment  If we make this substitution immediately we can get the objective function solely in terms of : , But does that really help? Either way we re going to have to differentiate . Which form of would you rather use? We think using two variables makes this objective function a bit easier on the eyes.    We ve seen visually that this problem has a solution and Fermat s Theorem tells us that the derivative of our objective function will be zero at that solution. So we differentiate both sides of which gives But recall that and are constrained by the equation from which we see that . Therefore or Setting equal to zero we have From our constraint we have . Inserting this into equation we see that Solving for gives   To find we use our constraint and the value of from equation ,   So we have found that the minimal square occurs when , and and it feels like we re done, doesn t it? We re not. The question asked was What is the area of the smallest possible square?

If we re lucky there will only be a few such and we can check them one at a time.  Finding the objective function is easy. The area , of any rectangle is its length, , times its width, , so is the objective function.  The perimeter, is and is constrained to be a constant (fixed) value so equation is the constraint.

Differentiate the constraint, giving the differential form of the constraint:     Set and solve this equation using the constraint and its differential form as needed.

We can find this minimum by the methods we are already familiar with. But it also has a local maximum at and global maximum at , and nothing we ve done so far would identify these two points as possible extrema.   It is clear from the graph what is happening, though. If we hadn t restricted the domain of our function then the graph would continue to rise on both sides and there would be no local or global maximum at all. The restriction on the domain forces the graph to stop rising at the endpoints of the interval which makes each of these endpoints a local maximum.  Thus we see that when the domain of our function is a closed interval there is also the possibility that a local or global extremum might occur at the endpoints of the interval as well. As a result, when searching for extrema we must always check the endpoints of the domain interval (if there are any).  To be clear, the end points of a closed interval are not transition points because there can be no transition between increasing and decreasing at an endpoint. It simply stops. However, since it is possible to have extrema at the endpoints they must also be checked whenever they are in play.  Be careful. When the domain of a function is artificially constrained like this it is easy to forget that the constraint is present. We tend to think of it as not really there. This is a mistake. Recall from Digression: The Tangent Function Has No Inverse that the definition of the domain is a part of the definition of a function. Think of the function s domain as the universe for that particular problem. Nothing exists outside of the domain. Thus in this example nothing exists outside of the interval (universe) .  "

  "body": " For this example we strongly suggest that you do not graph the objective functions first. Yes, we know this goes directly against our previous advice to always visualize your problem when you can, but one purpose of this section is for you to learn to analyze a problem using your Calculus tools. Much as an airline pilot must train to fly using only the cockpit instruments in case they have no other choice due to poor visibility, you should also practice flying blind so you can be successful even when you are not able to draw a useful graph. You will learn more, and you will learn better, that way.  Of course, once we ve moved beyond this section you should visualize your problem if you possibly can. We weren t kidding about that. You don t want to fly blind, you just need to be able to when it is necessary.  From the information gethered in Drill: can we conclude that either or has a global maximum at and a global minimum at ?  No we can t. They both have a local maximum and minimum at those points since both functions increase on , decrease on , and then increase again on . But from the information we have gathered so far we can t tell if the graph of either function rises above its value at or drops below its value at .  When we analyze and using the First Derivative Test we get exactly the same information from both functions. But they are very different functions. In particular, does not have any global extrema, while has both a global maximum and a global minimum. Graph them now and see. To distinguish, analytically, between and we will need a new tool called the Second Derivative Test.  But before we leave this example we need to address a small issue with our language. The phrase gets farther from zero in the negative (or positive) direction so does is awkward\\aside{It is also a bit imprecise for our purposes.}. In future examples we will instead usually abbreviate these as: as goes to negative (or positive) infinity, also goes to negative (or positive) infinity. Do not invest too much in these phrases. They cannot possibly mean what they pretend to mean. Infinity is neither a number nor a place so it is meaningless to say that  goes to infinity. Think of this as a kind of verbal shorthand, or notation.  "

But Fermat s Theorem only allows us to find a maximum that we already know exists. Since we did not have the tools necessary to show that we actually had a maximum, we relied on our intuition and assumed that a maximum existed. We will solve this problem one last time, showing that there must be a maximum this time.  Show that of all rectangles with a fixed perimeter, , the one with the greatest area is a square.    We will follow the outline above.     The objective function is      The only constraint is where is constant.    Since we are talking about a length it must be that . From equation we see that must be less that or equal to . Otherwise the perimeter will be greater than . So the domain of our problem is .   Comment  Strictly speaking if or we don t actually have a rectangle. But it is simpler to use the Extreme Value Theorem ( ) than to find the increasing and decreasing intervals using the First Derivative Test. Since the Extreme Value Theorem requires a closed domain we make things simpler by allowing zero width (or height) rectangles.     Since the problem domain is a closed interval we will use the Extreme Value Theorem ( ). To find the POTPs we will need . From equation we see that   From equation we have and also   Combining equation , equation , and equation we see that The only solution of is , so the POTPs for this problem are the end points, and , and .    The area, , will be zero when and when (why?) so by the Extreme Value Theorem the maximum occurs when .    This problem asks us to show that the maximal rectangle must be a square, so we need to show that . We know that the maximum occurs when . Plugging this value into equation we see that is also equal to . Thus the maximal rectangle is a square as stated.                                                                                                "

  "body": " Graphing with Calculus    Graphing with a Formula for   Mankind invented a system to cope with the fact that we are so intrinsically lousy at manipulating numbers. It s called a graph.   Charlie Munger (x)    In an age when everyone can open their cell phone and graph, for example, the function literally in seconds it may not seem important to understand the nature of functions at any deeper level. After all, if you have a formula you know everything there is to know about a function, right?  Well, yes . . . and no.  In a sense, obtaining a formula that describes whatever real-world phenomena you might be investigating is the Holy Grail , of science. And for exactly the reason you would expect. Formulas can tell us a great deal about the phenomenon. But they don t tell us everything.  For example, suppose equation ) describes some real world phenomenon. Does reading the formula give you any sense of the essential qualities of ? No, of course not. Because pictures are easier to understand than formulas we usually look at the graph of a function to get a sense of it. We used one of the many graphing systems available to generate the graph of seen in below. Impressive, isn t it?   A useless graph of           Because we simply used the default settings of our graphing tool this picture doesn t really help much either. We ll have to modify the viewing window to see anything useful. Take out your favorite graphing utility and adjust the settings until you find settings that give you a more useful display like the one in below.   A more usefull graph of          To be sure, this graph does tell us great deal about the qualitative behavior of . Visualizing the graph in this way is a good thing. But getting more detailed information can be tricky. For example, what are the exact values of the coordinates of the two places where the graph appears to graze the axis? One appears to be and the other appears to be , but is that right? Notice the horizontal and vertical scales. Can we be sure that at these scales all of the important bumps an wiggles on the graph are visible? When the top of the graph is at ten million can we tell, just by looking, if ?  You might well ask, Obviously when and  is near zero. Is it really important to know whether or not it is exactly zero?    Compute and to see if they are really near zero.   Use a calculator for , not for .   The fact is that it is hard to get good quantitative information from anything but very simple graphs. But does that matter? From the graph above we can see very plainly what is happening over a very large interval. Isn t that enough?  Well, that depends.  Suppose you are a nuclear engineer and you ve invented a simple process that requires an external source of energy. Suppose further that the graph above shows the rate of energy consumption, , of your process as a function of the ambient temperature, . Then any temperature at which is a temperature where the process is producing energy, not consuming it. Depending on rate of production and how simple the process is, being able to identify the temperature range where could be the difference between winning the Nobel Prize , and becoming a laughing stock.  You would want to know.  In this chapter we will explore some techniques that will help you win your Nobel Prize.   Comment  All you have to do is invent the process. Good luck. Please mention us in your acceptance speech.   In Chapter we saw that the First and Second Derivative Tests are exactly the tools necessary to answer each of the following questions:   On what intervals is the function increasing and on what intervals is it decreasing?    Where are the local extrema located?    What are the values of the local extrema?    Where does the inflection of the graph transition between concave up and concave down?      For example consider the following function. . Differentiating we see that This tells us that will have POTPs at and Testing a single point in each of the intervals between POTPs we see that and conclude that the graph is decreasing on the interval , increasing on the interval , and decreasing again on . Computing the second derivative gives: This tells us that will have PITPs at , , and . Testing a single point in each of these intervals between PITPs we see that and conclude that the graph is concave downward on the interval , concave upward on the interval , concave downward on the interval , and concave downward on the interval .    Use your favorite graphing tool to graph and confirm our conclusions.      The previous example was fairly simple so it was easy to keep all of the important information in mind at the same time. This will not always be the case so we will need ways to organize the data we collect. This will ensure that it is not overwhelming. Below we demonstrate one way to do this. It is not the only way. Let s sketch the graph of using Calculus. To use the First Derivative Test we ll need the derivative .  Setting the first derivative equal to zero and solving we see that we have a POTP at , , and at . To make all of this easier to see we arrange this data in the following table. Notice that we have organized our POTPs (and hence the intervals that we are testing) from left to right, just as they would appear on a number line.   The First Derivative Test Analysis          Interval                       From the table above we see that we have a local maximum at and and a local minimum at . Based on this information we could reasonably infer that the graph might might have the shape shown below.   The next step is to locate this graph on the - plane. From our table above we see that the local minimum is at , and the two local maxima are at .      Thus we can, again reasonably, infer that the graph of is located on the plane as shown below.   Unfortunately, we don t know that our graph is correct (in fact, it is not) because we ve made assumptions regarding its concavity that we haven t justified. This is the same error we made in the discussion following , back in when we drew a right triangle because it seemed to be correct. It is very easy to make this sort of mistake. Be careful. We can analyze the concavity of the graph using the second derivative in a manner very similar to what we did earlier with first derivative.     Confirm that the derivative of the function in is     Confirm that the second derivative of the function in is: .    Use an appropriate computational tool, or Newton s Method, to show that the PITPs of are: , , , and .    The PITPs in part (c) can actually be computed exactly. Find the exact solutions and confirm the approximations.                 Next we set up a table to analyze the concavity of .   The Second Derivative Test Analysis    Interval                          From we see that has inflection points at , , , and .         Combining the data in this table with the data in our previous table it would seem reasonable to infer that the graph of our function looks like the one below.   Does this graph above seem complete to you now? Obviously it is not, or we would not have asked, but do you see what is missing? What happens to as is very far from zero either the positive or the negative direction? Does continue to drop? Or does it eventually level off? We re not quite ready to talk about this yet, so give it some thought and take you best guess. We ll come back and finish this example in after we ve developed some essential notation and definitions.  Use the first and second derivatives to sketch the graph of each of the following functions, then sketch it again using graphing software. Resolve any discrepancies between the two graphs.                                                                                                   Graphing Without Formulas  At it s most fundamental a function is just a rule for associating a given input with its unique output. For example, we could specify a particular function by writing take two copies of the input, multiply them together and return the result as output. This is a complete and valid description but it is cumbersome to use. This is why we ve invented notation that allows us to write the description succinctly as the formula . It is easy to sketch an accurate graph of a function that is given as a formula, especially using modern technology, because the formula tells you the steps for finding the output for any given input.  As mentioned earlier, formulas are the Holy Grail of modern science and business. But, despite what you have seen in your mathematics education so far, very often we don t have such a formula. This is the usual situation. If you own a trout fishery business for example, you would love to have a formula that tells you how many trout your fishery will have on any given day of the year. With such a formula you could make plans for your business well into the future. We will talk about this in more detail in the next section.   For example, suppose we have the following information about a certain function. Can we sketch a reasonable graph of the function?               for all      for  and     for      for  and   In a sense this is easier than the previous problems, since intervals of increase, decrease, concave up, and concave down have already been determined for us. For example, here are the tables for each.   POTPs    Interval                     PITPs    Interval                                                     In we have and on the intervals and . Given that and when , did we really need to specify that on the interval ?    Based on the information given, the function has a local maximum at and inflection points at and A sketch of the graph might look something like this:      Sketch the graph of which satisfies the given requirements.       ,  for all           ,   ,   ,   for ,  for ,                              for all ,   ,   ,   for all ,   , for ,   , for ,         ,   does not exist,   ,   , for   , for         for all ,   ,   for all ,   for all .         ,   ,     for in ,   for in ,   for ,   ,   ,   for in ,   for in ,   for in ,         ,   , for ,   , for         for all ,   ,   ,   ,   , for   , for      for in ,   for in         , for all ,   ,   ,   , for ,   ,   ,   , for ,   for .      For this problem we restrict the domain to the interval .     ,   ,   , for ,     , for ,   ,   for ,   for ,   for                                                                     Graphing from the Graph of  In we found tphe graph of by examining the graph of its derivative, the Witch of Agnesi, The procedure we used in is quite general. For example, suppose the graph of is given below.    Recall that with a graph for , finding where is increasing or is decreasing is just a matter of determining where the derivative is positive (above the axis) or negative (below the axis). Similarly the concavity of the graph of can be determined by finding where is increasing (concave upward) and decreasing (concave downward). Given the graph of at the right, we can produce the following tables.   POTPs    Interval                   PITPs    Interval                 From the data in our tables we see that the graph of looks something like this.      Each of the following graphs is the derivative of some function. Find the shape of the graph of the function.                                                                         Graphing with a Formula for   When Depends on alone          Consider the IVP, In Integral Calculus (probably your next math course) you will learn how to find explicitly. For now we will be satisfied with sketching an approximate graph of . Setting and solving we see that and are the POTPs for . Thus on each of the intervals , , and the graph of is either always increasing or always decreasing. We tabulate this information as follows:   POTPs    Interval                              Based on this table, we can see that is a local minimum and is a local maximum. Observe that we do not know the value of , only that it must be a local maximum. Nor do we have any way to determine the value of in this problem.  We proceed in a similar fashion to determine concavity. The second derivative is Setting and solving, we see that is a PITP for . Making a table as before we have   PITPs    Interval                           Based on the table we see that the point is an inflection point. We want to make a reasonable sketch of the graph of based on this information. But there is a lot of information in and and our graph needs to be consistent with all of it. So we first organize all of our conclusions by plotting the transition points (both optimal and inflective) on the axis and identifying the intervals where is increasing, decreasing, concave up, or concave down.    This information, along with the initial value, allows us to provide a reasonable graph of .    From the initial condition in the IVP we know that but we have no information about the vertical coordinate of any other point on the graph. Thus, from the information given the scale of this graph is unknowable. But we know that the graph above is reasonable because it is consistent with the data given in the IVP. This sort of graphical, qualitative analysis is the best we can do with the information we have but, as you see, we can glean a great deal of information about the shape of the graph of a function from its derivative alone.     For each of the following IVPs:    Find the intervals on which the graph of the solution is increasing and decreasing. Identify the location all local extrema.    Find the intervals on which the graph of the solution is concave upward and concave downward. Identify the location of all inflection points.    Plot a reasonable sketch of the graph for Approximate transition points using the appropriate technology or Newton s Method as necessary.                                                                                             When depends on alone   To see a World in a Grain of Sand And a Heaven in a Wild Flower Hold Infinity in the palm of your hand And Eternity in an hour   William Blake (1757 1827)   Consider the IVP This is the same IVP we approximated in . The analysis we will do here is related so you may find it useful to review that section before proceeding.  As we ve seen every IVP has two parts: a differential equation (in this case, , and an initial value (in this case, or equivalently, ).           We will focus on the differential equation first. The differential equation says that at each point on the graph of the slope of the graph is equal to the vertical coordinate at that point. For example if is a point on the graph of , then nearby the graph of will look like the orange part of the sketch below. On the other hand, if is a point on the graph of then near the point , graph of will look like the red graph in the sketch below.   In fact, for any value of , we know that if is a point on the graph of then the slope of the graph which passes through that point will be parallel to the orange and red lines above (that is, if a solution of the differential equation passes through a point then its slope will be equal to at ).           This is seen in the figure below where each black dot represents a point with vertical coordinate equal to and each orange segment represents the graph of the curve that both satisfies the differential equation from IVP , and passes through that point.   Similarly, if we know that is a point on the graph of , where both solves the differential equation from IVP and passes through that point, then the slope at will be , as seen in the following sketch.    By tagging more points in the plane in the same way we get the image below.     Comment  Actually the Principle of Local Linearity applies so it is a short section of the line tangent at .   A sketch like this is called a slope field . The short line segment at each point, , is a short section of the graph of the function which satisfies the differential equation .  If we know where to start (i.e., if we have an initial condition) the slope field allows us to determine the shape of the entire graph.  For example to sketch the graph of if it passes through the point , we simply follow the line segments in our slope field starting at that point. This is the black graph in the sketch below. The graph of the that passes through the point is shown in red below, and the graph that passes through the point is shown in blue.      IVP has the initial condition, Plot the point and use this slope field to sketch the solution of IVP . Compare your solution with the approximation we obtained in . Do they look like the same solution?         Confirm that is the solution of the IVP , . (This is the black graph above.)    Confirm that is the solution of the IVP , . (This is the red graph above.)    Based on parts (a) and (b) guess what the solution of the IVP , will be. Confirm that your guess is correct. {If you guess wrong, guess again.}    Based on parts (a) and (b), and (c) make a conjecture what the solution of the IVP , will be. Confirm that your guess is correct.                  To sketch the graph of the solution of a given IVP begin by drawing the slope field for the differential equation. Then plot the value and follow the slope field to sketch the graph.    For each of the following IVPs sketch the slope field in the ranges given and use your slope field to sketch the solution of the IVP.   Advice  It is simplest to begin by sketching slopes at integer coordinate points and then to fill in between them to get a clearer sense of the graphs.}      , , ,      , , ,      , , ,      , , ,      , , ,      , , ,                                          When Depends on and  So far we ve examined the situation when depends on alone: and when depends on alone: .

  "title": "Modeling with Calculus",
  "body": " Modeling with Calculus    Population Dynamics    The purpose of mathematical models is not to fit to data but to sharpen one's questions.   Samuel Karlin (1924-2007)   In the introduction to Chapter we mentioned that the original motivation for the invention of Calculus was optimization. But after it was invented scientists and mathematicians found that Calculus is useful for solving a wide variety of other kinds of problems. In this chapter we will explore how Calculus helps us solve various non-optimization problems. As you will see the ability to sketch the graph of a function, even if it is only qualitative, is extremely useful.    Modeling a Trout Farm   A man may fish with the worm that hath eat of a king, and eat of the fish that hath fed of that worm.   William Shakespeare (1564-1616), Hamlet, Act IV, Scene 3   Suppose we are running an industrial trout fishery. There are a number of questions we'd really like to be able to answer at any given time. How large is the current stock? Do we have too few? Too many? Is our stock of trout in danger of dying off due to under or over population? How frequently can we harvest our stock without endangering it? Even if precise numbers aren't possible, it would still be useful to have a good, qualitative understanding of the life cycle of our stock of trout so we could make reliable estimates.  To gain such an understanding we will build a model of our trout population as a function of time. As a first approximation assume that we have complete control of the lake where we will hold the trout. We can supply all of the food and space that our trout need to continue reproducing.  Suppose that our lake is stocked with an initial purchase of tons of trout. Let represent the amount of fish we have, in tons, at time, , in years, (so tons). We can estimate the rate of growth of our population by casting a net into the same point of the lake each year and weighing the catch. Comparing the weight of the catch from year to year will give a reasonable estimate of the rate at which the trout population grows in one year.   Comment  Of course we'd want to always use the same sized net as well.   For the sake of specificity, suppose that the population is growing continuously at a nominal growth rate of %. Then we have just as we did in Section .  So the first model for our trout fishery lake is the following IVP:   This IVP should look familiar. When we were modeling the growth of a bacteria colony in  Section we got IVP , which is almost the same equation, remember? The only difference between them is that in IVP the coefficient of is and in IVP the coefficient of is .  Since the solution of equation was it seems reasonable to conclude that the solution of equation is:    Confirm that solves IVP .             The graph of is shown below. As you can see our trout population is growing exponentially, so it appears that we re going to get very rich as soon as we sell of all of those fish.   Of course, in practice this is not what happens. We made several simplifying assumptions when we began. We assumed that (1) we could supply all of the food our growing population needs, and (2) our trout would have all of the room they needed.  These assumptions are unrealistic in the long run. But in the short run they are not completely crazy.  Recall that in we described a situation in Lake Erie near Toledo, Ohio when, for a few days, the algae population grew exponentially in much the same manner as that suggested by our trout model. Naturally such growth cannot be sustained. Eventually the algae will consume all of the available nutrients, or will simply run out of space. They will then begin to die off. But our model, simple as it is, gives pretty accurate predictions of the population for small values of , be they a population of bacteria, algae, trout, or even humans.  In building a mathematical model of any physical phenomenon we start with the simplest model we can, find out where it goes bad, and then tweak it so that we:   keep those properties of the model that make realistic predictions, and    eliminate those properties of the model that make unrealistic predictions.   Thus we need to tweak IVP in such a way that when is near zero (or, at least, ), but which also recognizes that exponential growth is unsustainable.  Since exponential growth can't be maintained indefinitely the population must eventually stop growing and drop to a lower level or collapse entirely. Thus there must be a maximum population level, , where . Whatever that level is, we'll call it .  One way to tweak IVP to reflect this fact is to insert the factor as follows We see that if the trout population ever reaches it must level off since in that case . Therefore this model avoids predicting that the trout population will grow exponentially.  However, notice that for values of near zero, . Thus equation says that when is near zero but we needed so this particular tweak won't quite work because the difference between and could be substantial, depending on the value of (which we don't know).  So we will try a slightly different tweak. Instead of we will insert the factor as in IVP below. Notice that we still have when . But now we also have when is close to zero, so this change seems to meet the goal of our tweak. This type of IVP is called the Logistic Equation (or the Logistic Model) and its solution is a better long-term predictor of population growth than is the solution of equation as we will see.  The parameter would normally be determined experimentally (measured), but for purposes of this discussion we will arbitrarily assign it the value just to keep the numbers easy to deal with. So, our IVP will be     Compute the growth rate of the trout population for equal to                                                  It would be nice if we could find a formula for in terms of but this will have to wait for a course in Integral Calculus. Still we would like to provide a reasonable sketch of the graph of . Aside from the initial condition, , we don't know any specific values of but we can at least capture the qualitative behavior of the population.  We will obtain a sketch of the graph of in the same systematic way as before. We can use the first derivative test to determine when the trout population is increasing or decreasing. But keep in mind that we have in terms of  not  so we won't be able to say that the population is increasing or decreasing at a particular time. This will change how we interpret the results. For example we can say that when we have tons of trout the population is increasing even though we do not know when this happens.  It should be straightforward to see that the POTPs are . Since the context of our problem prohibits (why?), we will look at intervals and to determine for which values of the population is increasing or decreasing. We summarize this analysis in the following table:    Interval                         Suppose we were to use the data in the table above to plot a graph of versus . Would there be a maximum when . Explain why or why not..     In this problem we analyze the concavity of the graph of . In particular we'd like to find all values of where PITPs occur.    Show that and therefore     Find all values of where a PITP occurs.    Create a table similar to the one above to determine the (vertical) intervals on which is concave up or concave down.                      We now have enough data on to plot a reasonable sketch of the graph of but because all of our formulas are in terms of the dependent variable , our transition points and intervals are will all be shown on the vertical axis, not the horizontal as seen below.    Notice that we drew solid horizontal lines at and . At these population levels so, theoretically at least, once the population has achieved either of these levels it will never change again. This is correct when . Once all of our fish have died the only way we can get more is to buy them and start again. But for other values of it is still not entirely clear what s happening to our fish population.  It is not possible to maintain a population of trout at a constant value of tons. There will always be a little fluctuation above and below. All models are inaccurate in some way. This is one way in which this model is inaccurate.  The dashed line represents the population level where the graph of the population transitions from concave up to concave down. Physically this means that the rate of growth transitions from accelerating to decelerating. We can visualize this (below) using slope field technique we saw in .             Starting with an initial value of , we can plot the graph of the population and make a prediction of what will happened to the population in the long term. We just can t tell what long term means. That would have to be determined experimentally.  Notice that on the vertical interval the population is accelerating until it reaches tons. After that, it still grows, but is starting to decelerate. Over the long run it will approach (but never quite reach) a level of tons.        On the same set of axes, plot reasonable graphs for with the following initial values:    ,     ,     ,     .   Is it clear to you that none of these curves can cross? Think about it a moment, if two of these curves crossed, it would force to take on two different values for some value of Do you see why this can t happen? This fact should help you graph each function.    Sketch the graph you get if you start by purchasing tons of trout, rather than tons. Is this a good business decision?                                         Suppose our fishery has another lake full of bass, that the intrinsic growth rate is     Analyze this model in the same way we analyzed equation . Draw several typical graphs.    We can t make any money unless we sell some of our fish. Modify equation to account for harvesting at a uniform rate of .    Suppose tons. Sketch a graph of the population. What does the model predict about the amount of fish in the lake over a long period of time?    Assume that is still tons as in part (b), but this time the amount of harvesting is increased from to . Use a slope field to draw a graph of . What does the model predict now about the amount of fish over a long period of time?                            The general logistic growth equation is where is the population at time and the positive constants and are the intrinsic growth rate and carrying capacity , respectively. Recall that we obtained equation by tweaking equation (the exponential model) to account for die-off due to overpopulation.    Show that in this model is increasing and concave up when  is increasing and concave down when and is decreasing and concave up when     This is the same analysis we did above.We re just not assuming that this time.    Of course there is also a risk from underpopulation which our model does not account for. To catch this effect we tweak equation by inserting the factor where is a small positive constant. We justify this tweak in below.    Our new model is then     Show that when is very large equation reduces (approximately) to equation .    Show that when then . What does this say about the growth of the population when is near zero?    Find all values of for which the graph of is increasing and the values for which it is decreasing?    Show that Use this to determine the values of for which the graph of is concave upward and the values for which the graph of is concave downward.    Use the information to plot a sketch of the graph of where the initial value satisfies each of the following:                          Explain why is called the minimum viable population for the species.                                                           The Competing Species Model  When we modeled the populations of trout and bass in an industrial farm we did not have to account for competition between species because we assumed that the two species of fish were kept in separate lakes. For fish living in the wild we cannot make that assumption, but we can tweak our original model to account for competition between species in a natural setting. To do this we ll have to use two equations, one for each species.  So let s introduce a competing species of fish into the same lake. Bass and walleye compete in the wild for the same food source, so each one’s presence affects the other’s growth rate. To model the walleye population take for the carrying capacity, as the intrinsic growth rate of the walleye, and let denote the amount of walleye (in tons) at time . Combining this with our model for the bass population from we have the following equations for each species separately: These equations have no terms that model cross-species competition. That is, the value of does not affect the value of and vice versa , so we ll have to insert terms which do that.  Since they compete for food each species affects the others growth rate detrimentally. So we will model this interaction as follows    Comment  Just like the growth rates and carrying capacities we used earlier, these numbers are fabricated. We made them up. We (the authors) have inserted values for these parameters that we believe are reasonable but we do not pretend to know what might be realistic. If we were modeling a real population we would determine all of these parameters experimentally.   Notice that we took the growth rates from before and subtracted an identical term . This represents the detrimental effect of each species on the other s growth rate. For simplicity, we assumed that the effect of each on the other is the same. The fact that the new term, , has the product in it reflects the idea that to have an appreciable effect on each other, both species must have a sufficient number to produce the required interactions. Again, this model is overly simplified, but let’s see what long term effect this tweak has on both species.  To see that this is truly just a tweak of our previous model notice that if , then we would recover the previous model and over time would approach its carrying capacity of tons. Likewise, if , then, again we recover the previous model and over time would approach its carrying capacity of tons.  Given that , we want to determine what this model will predict happens to both species in the long term. Could they coexist or would one species drive the other to extinction? Take your best guess.  We ll start with . We want to find all of the points where ( is growing) and where ( is shrinking). We will start by determining where .   Thus we see that when  or when   Next we form the ( )ass ( )alleye plane, where each point identifies a particular pair of possible populations. For example the point represents the situation when there are tons of bass and tons of walleye in the lake.             In the sketch below we see from equation and equation that on each of the red lines we have .   Since the two red lines are the only locations where , it must be that is either greater than zero or less that zero in any region bounded by them. Choosing the point in the shaded region we see that Choosing the point outside the blue region we see that So for any bass\/walleye pair, , the bass population is increasing when lies below the diagonal line (in the blue region), and for any bass\/walleye pair, , above the diagonal line, the amount of bass is decreasing.  Finally, notice that when the bass population will increase until it reaches the carrying capacity of the lake for bass alone ( ), after which it will start to decrease. But if there are walleye in the lake the bass population will not reach the carrying capacity before it begins to decrease. This is consistent with the notion that the number of walleye adversely affect the growth rate of the bass.  Next we need to perform a similar analysis for the walleye population.    Apply the same type of analysis to to determine where is increasing and where is decreasing. Plot these regions in the first quadrant of the - plane just as we did above for the bass population.    If we superimpose the sketch you (should have) obtained from onto the graph we have above, we get the regions seen in the sketch below.    The points where the green and red lines intersect are called equilibrium points . Theoretically, if the two population levels are at an equilibrium point then neither population will ever change again because the growth rates are both zero.    Verify that the points , , and , are equilibrium points for our bass\/walleye populations.    Show that the coordinates of the equilibrium point are as given in the diagram below.                         But what happens if we don’t start at an equilibrium point? Would the levels tend toward an equilibrium over time as the name suggests? Take your best guess.  We can figure this out by looking at the growth rates in each region. For example, suppose the initial populations of bass and walleye, is in the blue region at the left. The bass population is increasing. Think of this as an arrow pointing to the right. In the same region the walleye population is decreasing which we can think of as an arrow pointing downward. Combining these arrows gives us an arrow pointing down and to the right.  Similarly, in the purple area the trajectory of the populations will be up and to the right since both populations are increasing. In the red area it will be up and to the left, while in the white area it will be down and to the left. All of this is displayed in the sketch at the left.  As rough as this qualitative drawing is, it gives us an idea of the population trajectories that the model predicts for the population levels of bass and walleye from various starting points.  Notice that these trajectories tend toward the equilibrium point, . This says that given these initial levels of bass and walleye, the levels will approach tons of bass and tons of walleye. This kind of problem is called a dynamical system and the path that the point follows for any given set of initial conditions is called its trajectory .    Are there any initial conditions where the trajectory approaches the points , , or ? Explain.          Suppose we adjust our differential equations slightly to Perform a similar graphical analysis to show that as long as , then any trajectory will approach the equilibrium point . That is, the walleye will become extinct, and the bass will approach their natural level of tons. How is this consistent with the adjustments we made from the original differential equations? Explain.    Now let s again adjust our differential equations to    Identify how this system of equations is different from the one in part (a), and interpret the difference in terms of the influence of each population on the other.    Perform a similar graphical analysis to show that the equilibrium points are , , , and . While it is theoretically possible for a trajectory to approach , show that most trajectories will either approach or . What does this mean for the fish populations, and is it consistent with the differential equations? Explain.       Compare the results in parts (a) and (b) with the example that started this section (equations and ). How does the coefficient of the term affect the model?                                             Selected Modeling Problems    Life is an incurable disease.   Abraham Cowley (1618-1667)     Epidemics, The SIR Model  The SIR Model is a fairly simple model that is frequently used to understand the spread of an infectious disease through a population. As with any mathematical model, it is over-simplified but, just like IVP , it provides a foundation which can be tweaked as needed for better predictions.  We will assume that every member the population falls into one of three categories: (S)usceptible, (I)nfected, or (R)ecovered. We assume that any population member who has recovered from the disease is immune to it, and those that have not are susceptible to infection.  We let Note that includes those victims who have died.   Comment  They have recovered in the sense that they can no longer be infected.    Assuming that no members are entering or leaving the population (by births, deaths from other diseases, or migration), explain why    Since the disease spreads by contact between a susceptible and an infected individual, we will assume that the number of susceptible population members is decreasing (you cannot get the disease twice) and the rate of decrease is proportional to the number of susceptible and the number of infected currently present. This says that for some positive constant, . The constant is called the transmission rate . (Why?)   Explain how we know that must be negative.   Since the only way to become immune is to recover from the disease, we also assume that the rate of change of is proportional to the number of infected individuals present. This means that for some positive constant . The constant is called the recovery rate . (Why?)        Explain how we know that must be positive.    Show that     Use the information in part (b) to show that the number of infected is increasing when and decreasing when     Show that and use this to show that when and is positive otherwise.                         Putting this together we see that the number of infected is increasing and accelerating when and increasing, but slowing down, when When it is decreasing.    The Tractrix   Truckin , got my chips cashed in Keep truckin , like the do-dah man Together, more or less in line Just keep truckin on.   The Grateful Dead (1967-1995)          We first looked at the curve called the tractrix  of . Consider reviewing that problem before you proceed.  Recall that initially the center of the rear axle of the tractor is at the origin and the center of the rear axle of the trailer is at the point Also we assumed that the tractor pulls the front wheels vertically up the -axis and that the rear wheels don’t slip.   we showed that the path followed by the center of the rear axle of the trailer follows, , must satisfy the IVP:         Show that satisfies the IVP in part (a). Graph this formula. Does it match your intuition about the shape of the curve? Does it match the graph you found using Euler s Method in ? You will learn how to derive this solution from IVP when you take Integral Calculus.    How far will the tractor have gone (in trailer lengths) before the trailer is within one degree of vertical?                     The Pursuit Problem   Our scientific power has outrun our spiritual power. We have guided missiles and misguided men.   Martin Luther King, Jr. (1929-1968)   Like the the tractrix problem above, we first looked at this pursuit curve in of . Consider reviewing that problem before you proceed.

  "body": " Limits and L Hôpital s Rule    Horizontal Asymptotes as Limits at Infinity   \\TLogo{PSP:lhopitals-rule}  In our fishery model in the previous chapter we referred to the carrying capacity of the lake, , as an asymptote. Loosely speaking, an asymptote is a line that the graph of a function gets close to. Any line can be an asymptote but we will be primarily interested in horizontal asymptotes (lines like the graph of ) and vertical asymptotes (lines like the graph of ).             Take another look at the graph of the Witch of Agnesi below. You can readily see that, as moves to the right gets closer and closer to zero. This is the essential idea but the phrase closer and closer is too vague for our purpose.   Here s why. In the sketch below, is moving to the right. As you can see gets closer and closer to . But it also gets closer and closer to both and .    While is getting closer and closer to all three of , , and it is only getting arbitrarily close to , and arbitrarily close is what we usually mean when we say closer and closer. When is getting arbitrarily close to we say that approaches and we write .   Mathematical Nomenclature  The phrase arbitrarily close will be adequate for our present purposes but eventually even that will not be sufficiently precise. The need for precise language is real and very delicate. We will return to this matter Chapter . For now be aware that we are not quite done perfecting the meaning of arbitrarily close.    It is clear that the graph of the Witch comes arbitrarily close to the line so we write as . This is spoken aloud as approaches zero as approaches infinity.     Limit Notation  Of course, the notion of approaching infinity is troublesome as well. That we speak in this fashion has more to do with the construction of the English language than with the mathematics we want to represent. If is proceeding toward zero (an actual number) it makes sense to say approaches zero. The notation captures this idea nicely. And since we usually pronounce the symbol as infinity it feels natural to write and to speak this aloud as approaches infinity as if is a place we could get to. But as we ve observed, this is absurd. Properly speaking the symbols should be spoken aloud as increases without bound, but nearly everyone says approaches infinity instead because it is a less cumbersome phrase. Like so much of mathematics this is perfectly clear once the underlying ideas have been internalized, but in the beginning it is can be quite confusing. Be patient with yourself.  An alternative, and more common notation is: which we read aloud as The limit as approaches infinity of one over one plus squared is equal to zero but this also collides with the construction of the English language. From the discussion above we know that \" indicates that increases without bound, but when we write what exactly does mean? What is equal to zero? Certainly the Witch is never equal to zero since its graph never crosses (or even touches) the axis.  The expression is making a very specific statement, one that is difficult to capture in a natural language like English. It says that the expression is approaching a particular value (zero) as approaches . The equals sign doesn t indicate that the function, actually equals that value. Instead it is the limit of which is equal to zero. Whether the function itself is ever equal to the limit, or not, is irrelevant. We re interested in what it gets arbitrarily close to.  We are treading at the edge of some very deep waters here so we will not attempt to address all of the nuances yet. Instead we will simply interpret the formula to mean that as approaches infinity ( ) the expression approaches zero .  In Chapter we will replace arbitrarily close with something much more precise. Indeed, finding a better way to say arbitrarily close will be the culmination of our efforts. This is what will allow us to finally replace differentials with a solid theoretical foundation.  But for now, we have enough to give our first definition of the limit concept.     An Intuitive Definition of a Limit at       If, as , gets arbitrarily close to some number , we write     If, as , gets arbitrarily close to some number , we write         As we ve observed, for very large positive values of , the function will be close to zero (the larger the value, the closer is to zero). Likewise, for very large, negative values of , will also get close to zero so:    We used the Witch for our first example because we are quite familiar with its properties from our earlier investigations. However we needn t have started with so complex a function.   Use the graph of to argue that and .   The limit concept is deeply abstract. We are introducing it here because, (1) the limit idea gives us a handy way to define asymptotes, and (2) when we return to in in Chapter it will be helpful if you are comfortable with the notation and the essential underlying idea.  We have the following definition.   Horizontal Asymptotes       If then the graph of the function has the horizontal asymptote,     If then the graph of the function has the horizontal asymptote,    as in the next three theorems.    In it will frequently be true that and are the same number. In that case we express both limits in the more compact form: .        Justify the following assertion as clearly and as carefully as you can: .    Generalize the statement in part (a).               From we know and from we know that Does it follow that   Yes, of course it does. In fact the following theorem is true.   The Limit of a Sum  Theorem Limit of a Sum   If and then    This can be expressed in words with the phrase, The limit of a sum is the sum of the limits.   The following two theorems are not quite as intuitive as Theorem , but they are also true.   The Limit of a Product  Theorem Limit of a Product   If and then    This can be expressed in words with the phrase The limit of a product is the product of the limits.    The Limit of a Quotient  Theorem Limit of a Quotient   If and then    This can be expressed in words with the phrase The limit of a quotient is the quotient of the limits.    Notice that in we specifically required that . This is necessary because, as we stated quite emphatically in Digression: Dividing by Zero , division by zero is an undefined concept. Thus if is equal to, say , and then But this is meaningless, so we say that does not exist, or equivalently that it is undefined.   Like the differentiation rules, when these limit theorems are used together they allow us to break a large problem into smaller, more tractable, pieces. Here are some examples.   We d like to find the horizontal asymptotes of if any exist. In this example we will write down all of the details of our computation. As you get more comfortable, you will probably abbreviate the process by doing much of this in your head. That s good, but also be sure you can fill in all of the details when needed. You will need to be comfortable with all of the details when the problems get more complex. From we see that if horizontal asymptotes exist they will be the lines and so we need to evaluate these limits. For the first limit we see from that Applying (several times) we have So the horizontal asymptote will be     Evaluate . Justify each step by citing the appropriate theorem or fact.    To find one horizontal asymptote of we evaluate:     Evaluate to find the other asymptote, if it exists.     Find the horizontal asymptotes of the graphs of the following functions.                                                     Of course, not every curve has a horizontal asymptote so not every function has a limit as approaches . For example, consider the curves and    Clearly these curves have no horizontal asymptotes because as they don t get close to a real number. In fact they either continue to rise or continue to drop as .   Mathematics Notation  Notice that we have used the plus-or-minus ( ) symbol to combine two limits into a single expression. There is no special meaning to this notation. We are just saving space on the page.   We represent this with the notation:             But once again we need to keep in mind that the symbol does not represent a number so saying that something is equal to is meaningless.   Comment  Of course, if we have a need for such a thing we can explicitly define the meaning of something ourselves. How would you define the phrase equals infinity?    What we mean when we write is that as increases without bound squared increases without bound.    Similarly means that as  . How would we say this in words?    It is especially important to keep in mind that is not a number when evaluating a limit like:   It is very tempting to attack this problem by noticing that each term is increasing without bound and write but in fact this limit is not zero. Can you see what the limit is? Give it some thought and take your best guess. We ll come back to it shortly.   It is very clear that the limit: is zero. After all, is constantly equal to zero so we have . So it seems to be clear that . Anything minus itself has to be zero doesn t it? Even grandmother - grandmother must be zero, right?  But now consider this limit: . Both and so also has the form doesn t it? But is constantly equal to so, we have Thus it appears that can be zero, and that can be . But so that can t be! Moreover there is nothing special about . We could have chosen any number to make our point. So we conclude that is meaningless. Equivalently, we say it is undefined.  The source of the difficulty here is that only numbers can be subtracted. But neither nor grandmother is a number so the expressions and grandmother - grandmother are utter nonsense.   Comment  Your teacher will tell you, if you ask, that we aren t being entirely honest here. Mathematicians routinely add, subtract, multiply, and divide lots of things that you probably would not recognize as numbers. But grandmothers, and infinities are not among them.   Find two functions, and such that as both and but is equal to each of the following.                            An arbitrary real number                  Limits can be deceptive so be careful. It can be helpful to have built in notational cues to remind ourselves that these are subtle problems. When we are working with limits we will use the notation to remind ourselves that is not a number.   Mathematical Notation  This: is not a standard notation so you probably won t see it anywhere except in this textbook. No matter. Once you master the underlying idea, notation is easy to deal with.   Returning to the limit and using this notational cue we have This says that this limit consists of something which is approaching (increasing without bound) minus something else which is approaching (again, increasing without bound). When we say it like this more importantly when we think about it like this we can see that the value of the limit will depend upon precisely how the two parts increase without bound.  We now know that this limit is not necessarily equal to zero, but how can we discover what it actually is equal to? As in much of Calculus we need to re-express our formulas algebraically to see what is going on.  Rewriting as we have which says that we have an expression which is increasing without bound multiplied by an expression which approaches the number one. Obviously the product will also increase without bound so we write   Next we consider the limit    Comment  This is not the same limit. Look closely.   Proceeding as before we see that This makes sense intuitively. We would expect that for large values of (either positive or negative), will continually outgrow ( approach infinity faster than) .  We have established that, because is not a number, the expression does not make sense. What about ? Is it true that ?  No, of course not. The expression is meaningless for the same reason that - is meaningless.    Consider . It is tempting to write , but as we have observed, is not a number so this makes no more sense than .  Once again, the key is to re-express the function algebraically. Factoring out the highest power of the variable from both the numerator and the denominator we see that   You may well ask, How did we know to factor out the highest power of the variable? The answer is very unsatisfying. We were taught this technique by our teachers, just as you are being taught now. We d have been hard pressed to come up with it on our own.       (Continued from )  Recall that we did not complete because we did not previously have any way to determine what happens to the graph of as or as . We do now. Finding what happens to the graph of as or as is equivalent to evaluating the following limits: We will evaluate the first one and leave the second as a drill. Proceeding as in we see that     Show that is also equal to two.   We can now see that has a horizontal asymptote at . If you haven t already done so consider graphing this function to confirm.   Show that each of the following statements is true.                                                         Do you think the function has any horizontal asymptotes? Take your best guess before we begin this example. To find any horizontal asymptotes we have to evaluate the two limits First we ll find the limit as and leave the limit as as a drill for you.  As always the trick is to rearrange this expression inside the limit algebraically without changing its value until we can see clearly what happens as . The square roots seem to be the difficulty here. So we d like to find a way to make them go away. The standard trick for this is to multiply by the conjugate of , namely .   Comment  We are using the identity to square both terms and get rid of the square roots. The factors and are mutually conjugate.   Of course, if we do that then we need to divide by the conjugate as well. That way we ve multiplied by and have not changed the value of the expression. This won t actually eliminate the square roots as we will still have them in the denominator. But let s see what happens.   Factoring the highest power of out of the numerator and denominator gives and since we have But we re evaluating a limit as . So, we re really only interested in large, positive values of . In this case so   Did you guess right? If you did, either you have a very strong intuition for these kinds of problems or you just had a moment of blind luck. So don t just pat yourself on the back and walk away. Be sure to take a moment to figure out whether it was intuition or luck. You don t want to confuse them.  If you guessed wrong, or (most likely) were unable to come up with a guess don t fret about it. You re normal. But be sure you review and understand the steps to this solution so you can begin to build some intuition about such problems. This problem looked pretty intimidating, but once we got going in the right direction, it was all Algebra from there. Notice how the absolute value came into play. In this problem it wasn t an issue since we were considering only positive values of . But consider what would happen if was negative, if . In this case,    This is important. If you don t see why when ask your teacher about it.    DIGRESSION: The Absolute Value Function  Digression Absolute Value Function    It is not true that , although this is an easy mistake to make. It is not true because the square root function, , is the functional inverse of the function Note that the domain restriction means that always returns a positive number. Thus , but , also. Similarly, When is negative because when negative is positive.   END OF DIGRESSION    Try to guess the value of and then evaluate the limit to see if you guessed correctly.   Determine the following limits.                                         The Squeeze Theorem            It is clear from the graph at the right that does not exist since the has no horizontal asymptotes. To say that this limit does not exist means that is not approaching any particular value as . It s not even approaching  or since it is bounded both above and below.   Now how about this limit: Since does not exist we can t apply Theorem . Neither is it of the form so none of the techniques we ve used before will help us.  We need a new idea.  Look at the graph of :    Can you see that the horizontal asymptote is ?  It certainly looks like is an asymptote in both directions which seems to suggest that[1mm] \\centerline{ }[1mm] This is correct, but is there a way to see this algebraically? After all, this graph could just as easily support the conclusion that (or any other number which is extremely close to zero) is the asymptote. We don t want to draw conclusions from a picture, but it is difficult to see what we can do, isn t it?  We will analyze what happens when and leave the case as a drill for you.              Let s disassemble our function in order to understand it better. The function clearly comes in two parts: and . Because we know that If we graph , , and together as in the sketch at the right we see that for positive values of the graph of is always caught between the graph of and , as seen below.   We know that both as . Since is caught between and it follows that, for positive values of , the highest and lowest points on the graph of must also approach zero as . Therefore .   Show that for negative values of , also, so that as well.   This idea is often called the Squeeze Theorem or the Sandwich Theorem.   The Squeeze Theorem, (when )  Theorem Squeeze Theorem, (when )  There are two cases:   If on some interval, and then also.    If on some interval, and then also.      In the previous example, notice that we had for all , but this is more than is actually required. We only need for the inequality to be satisfied when sufficiently large, in either the positive or negative direction. That s why we only require that on the interval (positive case) or (negative case) rather than for all values of .    Use the Squeeze Theorem to determine each of the following limits:               where represents the greatest integer\\aside{This is called the greatest integer function in mathematics, and the floor function in computer science. It rounds down to the greatest integer. For example , etc.} less than or equal to .                  Back in Section you showed that satisfies the differential equation which models damped oscillation (oscillation with resistance): Since is called a damped oscillator what do you expect to be equal to? Guess, if you aren t sure.    Use the squeeze theorem to compute Is this consistent with your guess? Explain.      Vertical Asymptotes               It should be clear from the sketch below that in addition to the horizontal asymptote , the graph of also has a vertical asymptote of .   We can extend the ideas and the notation we ve developed for horizontal asymptotes to handle vertical asymptotes as well. First note that since the expression is not defined for we can t talk about the behavior of the function at zero. But we can talk about its behavior near zero. But the graph is very different depending on whether or . We will focus first on positive values of .  For near zero, and positive, it is very clear what is happening. As the function continues to increase without bound. We capture this notationally with    Mathematical Notation  This notation is not universal. The standard notation is .   The limit in equation ) is called a right-hand limit and is read aloud as the limit as approaches zero from the right, of one over equals infinity.   The expression means that is approaching the number zero. The qualification specifies that it is approaching from the right. So writing means that as from the right, the function increases without bound.   Mathematical Notation  This should probably be written as but sadly, it has become standard to say, and to write, that this limit equals infinity, which is absurd.   If we restrict to negative values then we see that\\aside{Note that the sense of the inequality has changed from equation ). It is now less than. } The limit in equation ) is called a left-hand limit and is read aloud as the limit as approaches zero from the left, of one over equals negative infinity. Right- and left-hand limits are generically called one-sided limits . One-sided limits are important theoretical tools but their theoretical value is not important to us right now. We will discuss them in more depth in Section .  A function , will have a vertical asymptote as if either of the one-sided limits is or ( is increasing or decreasing without bound). We formalize this statement in the following definition.     Vertical Asymptotes    If then the line is a vertical asymptote of the graph of .    Compute each of the following limits. Read the notation carefully.                             Find all vertical asymptotes of the graphs of each of the following functions.                                                Indeterminate Forms and L Hôpital s Rule   L Hôpital s Rule  Based on our experience so far it is tempting to conclude that we can locate vertical asymptotes by simply setting the denominator equal to zero and solving. But this is a naive conclusion as we will see next.   Consider . Setting the denominator equal to zero yields and , but only one of these is a vertical asymptote. Do you see which one?  Let s take a careful look at this example. By Definition we will have a vertical asymptote when either one-sided limit of a function increases or decreases without bound, so we must evaluate each one-sided limit.  For , we have So the line is indeed a vertical asymptote.    Explain how you know the limit above is not .   Similarly    Explain how you know the limit above is not .   We were careful to use one-sided limits to find the vertical asymptote at because this is what calls for. Strictly speaking we only needed one of them, but since these limits were not equal we evaluated them both.  However, for , both one-sided limits are the same so we have    Confirm and .   Observe that this limit has the form . A limit of this form is called an Indeterminate Form \\aside{There are other kinds of Indeterminate Forms. We will encounter them later in this chapter.}.    Find all vertical asymptotes of the graphs of each of the following functions.                                                demonstrates that a function which does not exist at a point is a more general concept than a function with a vertical asymptote at a point.   Mathematical Terminology  A function with a vertical asymptote fails to exist. but it fails in a very particular manner. It increases (or decreases) without bound. Speaking colloquially, we say that it blows up at the point   Notice that is undefined at both and , but it only has an asymptote at . It also displays something subtle about limits. One would be tempted to say that and this is true when . However, if we graph the two functions, and we see that there is a small difference between them:    Do you see the difference? The value of is not defined because and we get a zero denominator. But no such difficulty occurs with because .   Comment  This discussion is also a cautionary tale about the use of graphing technology. These two graphs appear to be identical when we use technology to graph them.   So, when , and are the exactly the same. But they disagree when . More precisely is not in the domain of but it is in the domain of . Since the domains differ they must be different functions and it is incorrect to write even though it is true for all but one value of .    Suppose is a real number.    Find all vertical asymptotes of .    Does your solution of part (a) still work when ?               In we looked at the Folium of Descartes from Newton s dynamic point of view.    In that problem you showed that the fluents, and satisfy the equation of the Folium: and that is the only value of where . How then, can it be that the Folium crosses itself at the origin?    In you determined that when . Determine the values of for which and the which .    Show that     Compute in terms of and compute . Is this consistent with what you see on the graph?    Show that for , so that geometrically, represents the slope of the line joining the origin to the point on the graph of the Folium. Is this consistent with what you obtained in part a? Explain.    Compute each of the following:                                Is this consistent with the graph and the fact that represents the slope from the origin to the point ? Explain.                                                                       We found earlier that , so the function must have a horizontal asymptote at . Clearly is undefined at . Does its graph have a vertical asymptote at ? Take your best guess.  To answer this question we need to evaluate the limit . But how can we do that? If we try the obvious ploy of just plugging in zero for we get the indeterminate form , and we know we need to proceed cautiously with an indeterminate form.              From the graph of (in the sketch below) it would appear that as . This is correct, but we ve learned to be wary of relying on graphs. It would be best to evaluate the limit by another technique if possible.   Can we apply some algebraic trick like we did in ?  It is hard to see what it would be. There isn t much algebra we can do here. If there were other trigonometric functions involved we might be able to employ some trigonometric identity in the numerator, but there just isn t much we can do with . This problem poses a bit more of a challenge than the indeterminate forms we have dealt with so far. We need a new idea.  Since the isn t helping maybe we can replace it with something simpler. Seriously. Give some thought to what might be a valid replacement before reading on. Remember that we re really only interested in values of that are very close (infinitely close?) to zero.  The Principle of Local Linearity says that the graph of a function and its tangent line are locally indistinguishable. Since we re only interested in values of near zero locally around zero let s try replacing with its tangent line.   Show that the line tangent to at is .   Replacing with , we have which is consistent with what we see in the graph above. Our idea is showing some promise.   Comment  We ve placed the question mark over the equals sign because we don t (yet) actually know that this is a valid approach. We re just trying out ideas at the moment.   Let s try this again with which also has the indeterminate form .    Show that the equation of the line tangent to at is: .    Show that the equation of the line tangent to at is:             Since we are evaluating the limit at we will replace the numerator and denominator with their tangent lines at :   For comparison we ll also evaluate this one by methods we ve used before. Specifically if we factor the numerator and denominator we get: which is consistent with what we found previously. Our idea seems to be holding up.  Let s try one more. The limit also has the indeterminate form so we ll need the tangent lines of the numerator and denominator at again.    Show that is the equation of the line tangent to at .    Show that is the equation of the line tangent to at .            Replacing the numerator and denominator by their tangent lines at , we get    Graph the equation and zoom in on the portion of the graph near . Does it look like we ve found the correct limit?   The idea of replacing the numerator and denominator of indeterminate forms with their tangent lines has worked in all of our examples so let s look at this problem in a more general context. If and are differentiable functions such that then is an indeterminate form.   Show that the equations of the lines tangent to and at are            If we replace and with their tangent lines at we have\\aside{We need to assume that . Do you see why?} This is consistent with all of our examples above so it appears that the Principle of Local Linearity has led us in the right direction. All of the evidence we ve gathered so far suggests rather strongly that when we are faced with the indeterminate form simply replacing the numerator and denominator with their tangent lines will work.          This idea is due to the Swiss mathematician Johann Bernoulli . Johann and his brother Jacob Bernoulli ( ) were taught Calculus by Leibniz himself, but soon showed themselves to be his equal, or nearly so.    Johann Bernoulli (1667-1748)    The Marquis de L Hôpital, Guillaume François Antoine de L Hôpital was keenly interested in the new Calculus so he struck a deal with Johann. The Marquis agreed to pay Bernoulli to tutor him and to keep L Hôpital abreast of new mathematical developments. This was done with the understanding that Lt Hôpital would include some of Bernoulli s research results in the Calculus textbook L H\\^{o}pital was writing at the time. This turned out to be the very first Calculus textbook: Analyse des Infiniment Petits pour l Intelligence des Lignes Courbes (Analysis of the Infinitely Small for the Understanding of Curved Lines) . It was published in 1696.    The Marquis de L Hôpital (1661-1704)    Even though L Hôpital acknowledged his indebtedness to Johann Bernoulli for this procedure it has always been known as L Hôpital s Rule .   Pronunciation  L Hôpital s name is pronounced LOW-Pea-Tall, not le-HOS-pital.   As a mathematician L Hôpital was not in the same league as Leibniz, Newton, or the Bernoullis few are but he was a very competent mathematician and his work helped to disseminate the ideas of Calculus just as Maria Gaëtana Agnesi s text would do in the following century.  Now look back at the examples in this section and notice the following fact: In each case when the limit was finally evaluated it turned out to be the slope of the line tangent to the graph of the numerator divided by the slope of the line tangent to the graph of the denominator. But the slope of the line tangent to at is simply (recall that in Section we introduced Lagrange s prime notation): We said at the time that there would be times when Lagrange s notation is much more convenient than the differential notation. This is such a time. In this section we will be using Lagrange s notation exclusively to indicate derivatives. .  In light of it appears that we don t need to go to the trouble of finding the tangent lines. We can evaluate these indeterminate forms as follows:   L Hôpital s Rule, (First Special Case)  Theorem L Hôpital s Rule First Special Case  Suppose and are differentiable on an open interval containing and that . Suppose also that \\centerline{ and }. Then    Notation  We will use the notation to indicate that is equal to because of L Hôpital s Rule.    Because L Hôpital s Rule applies directly to the indeterminate form we will refer to this as a L Hôpital Indeterminate . Not all indeterminate forms can be handled so easily.   Consider This is a L Hôpital indeterminate so     Consider This is a L Hôpital indeterminate so    We want to emphasize very strongly that L Hôpital s Rule requires a L Hôpital indeterminate. If we don t have a L Hôpital{ indeterminate we can not use L Hôpital s Rule. If you try to use L Hôpital s Rule when it does not apply, you will probably not get the correct answer. The difficulty here is that nothing in the computations will alert you that anything has gone wrong. You have to be watchful for this potential pitfall.   For example, if we mistakenly try to use L Hôpital s Rule, on we will obtain , but this is obviously incorrect.    Show that .     Compute each of the following limits:                                                                                   is useful but it is much too limited, so to speak. For example, it does not help us with this limit: . Even though it is a L Hôpital indeterminate, when we apply we have This is useless because is still not defined.  We need to think about this again. It is true that is not defined, but if and then is a L Hôpital Indeterminate so we extend as follows:    L Hôpital s Rule, (Second Special Case)  Theorem L Hôpital s Rule Second Special Case  Suppose is the L Hôpital Indeterminate form . Then    Our derivation of is not entirely rigorous. We will not be providing a fully rigorous derivation of L Hôpital s Rule because doing so is both difficult to produce and to understand. There are deep foundational issues involved and investigating these would take us too far from our primary purpose, gaining proficiency with its use. Returning to our example and using this time we have The limit on the right is yet another L Hôpital Indeterminate so we apply L Hôpital s Rule again.     Use to compute each of the following limits. If this limit given is not a L Hôpital Indeterminate rearrange it algebraically, without changing its value, until it is a L Hôpital Indeterminate.          Assume that .     Assume that .                                                       L Hôpital s Rule and Horizontal Asymptotes  Our discovery of L Hôpital s Rule grew from our investigation of vertical asymptotes. Is there any way that we can extend L Hôpital s Rule to help us with horizontal asymptotes? For example, consider   This limit is indeterminate of the form , so it seems like L Hôpital s Rule would apply. But both versions of L Hôpital s Rule (so far) require that where is a real number. And of course, infinity still insists on not being a number, real or otherwise. If we want to use L Hôpital s Rule we ll have to find a way to modify this limit so that L Hôpital s Rule does apply.  If we make the substitution then as , .   Notation  Since through positive values we need to constrain to do the same.   After substituting we have Now we apply L Hôpital s Rule and we see that   Far more important than the answer in this example is the realization that we can use the same trick to extend L Hôpital s Rule to the case where approaches both and   To see this in the general situation suppose that and Make the substitution , so that when we would have the one-sided limit as approaches zero from the right side. Now we can use L Hôpital s Rule with as the variable. A similar development would work for   Although we have not discussed it, it is also true that L Hôpital s Rule applies directly to the indeterminate form , so in addition to , we will call these L Hôpital Indeterminates as well.  Putting this all together gives us the general statement of L Hôpital s Rule:   L Hôpital s Rule  Theorem L Hôpital s Rule  Suppose is any L Hôpital Indeterminate. Then We allow the possibility that which we understand to mean that increases or decreases without bound.     Compute each of the following limits. Use where appropriate.                         ,                                                           3  As both and increase without bound, but which one increases faster? Take a quick look at the graphs below.    As both graphs are flattening out, but it would appear that the natural logarithm function is outgrowing the cube root function. Is it? We can answer this question by looking at the limit, If the limit is then is growing faster. If it is zero then is increasing faster than (Do you see why?)     Which of and grows faster?    Can we draw any conclusions about the rate of increase if the limit is something other than or ? If so, what? If not, why not?               Use L Hôpital s Rule to determine which of the following pairs of functions are growing faster as .                                                    Based on the limits above write down a general conclusion about the rate of change of the natural logarithm as compared to roots.    Prove that your statement is correct.                      Colloquially the phrase exponential growth just means that something is growing very fast, but it has a more precise meaning in mathematics. It means the growth rate is described by an exponential function. For example neither nor grows exponentially. They are both said to grow polynomially . But , , and even all do grow exponentially The next problem explores how exponential growth compares polynomial growth.    Mathematica Terminology  As we saw in  is said to decay exponentially.          Show that each of the following limits is zero.                 Explain how this implies that that grows faster than , , or even ?    Would for any positive integer Explain.    Suppose that any polynomial and show that . Do you see that this means that the natural exponential grows faster than any polynomial?    Suppose that any polynomial. Show that each of the following limits is also zero. What do you conclude from this?                                                                                 More on L Hôpital s Rule  Consider the limit If we want to evaluate this limit (we do) we seem to have few options. This is not a L Hôpital Indeterminate, nor is it obvious what the limit might be. Simply letting we see that and so our limit has the Indeterminate form .  There is a real temptation to say that this must be zero since anything multiplied by zero is zero. But is it? Remember that the purpose of the arrow notation, , is to remind us that the expression is never actually equal to zero. It merely approaches zero. At the same time is increasing without bound ( ) so it seems that the value of the limit might depend on the relative speeds with which and .  But this reasoning feels very uncertain doesn t it? And, in any case, nothing we ve said will help us evaluate the limit. We ll have to find a way to re-express this limit as a L Hôpital Indeterminate so that L Hôpital s Rule does apply. In the meantime, take your best guess as to the value of this limit and write it down for later reference. Suppose we rewrite this limit as This is a little scary to look at so we ll make it easier on our eyes with the substitution . As we see that and . Since our limit is now which is the L Hôpital Indeterminate . Thus by Theorem we have since .   Did you guess correctly?  Notice that the trick we used was a simple substitution much like the ones we have used in the past to make things easier on the eyes. The difference here is that we re not making anything easier on the eyes. If anything we re making things harder to look at since re-writing as certainly doesn t seem like it s going to help much. Until we try it. Always try your ideas out no matter how crazy they seem to be. Only after you try an idea can you tell if it will work or not.  Recall that in Section where we defined the effective yield of an investment which is compounded continuously. We were led to examine the expression for very large values of .  As a result of that investigation we accumulated considerable numerical evidence that in one year an investment of growing at a nominal rate of , compounded continuously would grow to , but we were unable to do more than gather evidence. It was pretty convincing evidence but it was not proof since we didn t yet have the mathematical technique necessary to evaluate the expression as . Now we do.   We need to evaluate the limit: It is tempting to reason as follows. We see that as . That is, we have the indeterminate form and since one raised to any power is equal to one this limit must equal , right? Surely you know better than to jump to that conclusion by now. Not only does all of the evidence of this chapter warn you that limits are more subtle than that, but in our investigations in we saw overwhelming evidence that this limit is not equal to one.  Also, notice that we wrote , not . Why do you think we did that?  The source of our difficulty here is that the variable is in the exponent where we can t get at it. We d like to find a way to bring it out of the exponent. The natural logarithm seems perfect for this task since it has the property that .  Begin by setting . Then Rather than evaluating directly we evaluate the limit of the logarithm of . Thus The limit on the right is an indeterminate form but unfortunately it is not a L Hôpital Indeterminate. So, as before, we ll have to do some algebraic manipulations first. Set so that Since it seems intuitively clear that , doesn t it? In fact, it is not true generally that But it is true for this problem.      Thus this is a detail that needn t trouble us for now. So we will ignore it for now and return to it in .         Show that     Show that for .   Let and manipulate this limit until it looks like the limit in part (a) (with different letters, of course).    Suppose we have an investment of compounded continuously with a relative annual rate of How much would the investment be worth in years? How would this compare to an investment which is compounded quarterly?   You may want to review similar problems in before starting this problem.                      Consider . Notice we are only considering positive values of (Why?) Proceeding in the same manner as before, let so that Thus This is a L Hôpital Indeterminate so we apply L Hôpital s Rule: Thus    We have seen the following indeterminate forms:                             .     Of these, only the last two are L Hôpital Indeterminate forms. The others must be evaluated by some method other than directly applying L Hôpital s Rule. Often this simply means algebraically rearranging them into a L Hôpital Indeterminate.  The following are not indeterminate forms. Don t try to use L Hôpital s Rule on them. (In fact, you can evaluate each of these just by knowing the form. Try it.)              .       Evaluate each of the following limits.                                 Not every indeterminant form requires L Hôpital s Rule.                  Set and consider .                          "

As always the trick is to rearrange this expression inside the limit algebraically without changing its value until we can see clearly what happens as . The square roots seem to be the difficulty here. So we d like to find a way to make them go away. The standard trick for this is to multiply by the conjugate of , namely .

Of course, if we do that then we need to divide by the conjugate as well. That way we ve multiplied by and have not changed the value of the expression. This won t actually eliminate the square roots as we will still have them in the denominator. But let s see what happens.   Factoring the highest power of out of the numerator and denominator gives and since we have But we re evaluating a limit as . So, we re really only interested in large, positive values of .

If you guessed wrong, or (most likely) were unable to come up with a guess don t fret about it. You re normal. But be sure you review and understand the steps to this solution so you can begin to build some intuition about such problems.

  "title": "What’s Wrong with Differentials?",
  "body": " What's Wrong with Differentials?   Introduction    In the pursuit of truth we must beware of being misled by terms which we do not rightly understand. That is the chief point.  Bertrand Russell (1872-1970)   To see what s wrong with differentials consider the circle and the differential triangle below.    Suppose that is one of the differentials that makes up the circle. Since is a non-zero increment it has two distinct endpoints so we can draw the two radii shown. Because the two (distinct) endpoints that lie on the circle are infinitely close together the two lines have the same slope. But all of the radii of a circle pass through the center of the circle so these two in particular must also intersect at the center, and we conclude that we have two parallel lines that intersect.  But the only way that can happen is if they are actually the same line, and if they are the same line then the points on the circle are not really distinct as we ve drawn them. But if they are not distinct then , , and are all actually equal to zero. If =0 then is meaningless (why?).  This simple argument appears to completely destroy the differential foundation upon which we ve based everything we ve done up until now. Try as we might we can t escape the contradictions inherent in the very notion of infinitely small numbers.  This is very troubling.    Calculus and Bishop Berkeley    In my opinion, a mathematician, in so far as he is a mathematician, need not preoccupy himself with philosophy an opinion, moreover, which has been expressed by many philosophers.    Henri Lebesgue, (1875-1941)      Bishop George Berkeley      Pronuciation  His name is properly pronounced bark lee, not \"burk lee.\"   In an even more devastating repudiation of differentials was published by George Berkeley ( ), the Anglican Bishop of the Diocese of Cloyne, Ireland in a treatise ponderously entitled,   Comment  Usually it is just called The Analyst .      THE ANALYST; or, a Discourse Addressed to an Infidel MATHEMATICIAN, wherein it is examined whether the Object, Principles, and Inferences of the modern Analysis are more distinctly conceived, or more evidently deduced, than Religious Mysteries and Points of Faith.    Berkeley s critique was both fierce and correct. Fortunately, it was also (mostly) ignored in its time. Just as we have been so far, mathematicians of the time were too busy using Calculus to concern themselves much with the underlying foundational issues he illuminated so well. But these foundational issues are real and the time has come for us to address the profound logical difficulties inherent in the notion of an infinitely small quantity.  You may well wonder why a Bishop in the Church of England and a philosopher would concern himself with the methods of scientific analysis and investigation. The fact is that Berkeley didn t really have any quarrel with the use of differentials (or fluxions) in science at all. He was, in fact, a great admirer of Newton and he understood very well that the techniques Newton and Leibniz had introduced actually worked, at least most of the time. He says as much himself in The Analyst    Historical Note  In the eighteenth century English nouns were frequently capitalized, and spelling was not as standardized as it is today, so Berkeley s work looks a little odd to modern eyes. Nevertheless, it is quite readable. Stretch yourself a bit.    I have no Controversy about your Conclusions, but only about your Logic and Method . . . It must be remembered that I am not concerned about the truth of your Theorems, but only about the way of coming at them; . . . it may perhaps seem an unaccountable Paradox, that Mathematicians should deduce true Propositions from false Principles, be right in the Conclusion, and yet err in the Premises . . . (Section XX)   Berkeley might not have bothered publishing his criticisms of Calculus but during the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries a religious movement known as Deism (called Free-Thinking in England) was very strong throughout Europe. Many of the scientists of the age were supportive of the Deistic movement because, while Deism itself is not a form of atheism, many of its adherents were atheists. Moreover the Free-Thinkers in England explicitly espoused the questioning and criticism of religious tenets and attitudes. Christianity was attacked by some Deists on the grounds that it was not logical and contained too many mysteries.  As a member of the clergy Berkeley felt compelled to answer these criticisms. Speaking directly to the English scientific community he said,    Whereas then it is supposed, that you apprehend more distinctly, consider more closely, infer more justly, conclude more accurately than other Men, and that you are therefore less religious because more judicious, I shall claim the privilege of a Free-Thinker; and take the Liberty to inquire into the Object, Principles, and Method of Demonstration admitted by the Mathematicians of the present Age, with the same freedom that you presume to treat the Principles and Mysteries of Religion; to the end, that all Men may see what right you have to lead, or what Encouragement others have to follow you. (Section II)   He made his purpose clear from the outset by including a biblical verse (Mathew, chapter 7, verse 5) on the title page of The Analyst :    First cast out the beam out of thine own Eye; and then shalt thou see clearly to cast out the mote out of thy brother s eye.    So Berkeley s purpose in writing The Analyst was to defend his religion rather than to attack mathematics. But he was well acquainted with the adage, The best defense is a good offense and he mounted a very good defense.  Some of Berkeley s specific criticisms will be illuminating.   Historical Background  The language of Calculus wasn t entirely established yet so when Berkeley says Differences he means what we ve been calling differentials.    . . . they consider the Increments or Decrements themselves, which they call Differences, and which are supposed to be infinitely small . . . . Now to conceive a Quantity infinitely small, that is, infinitely less than any sensible or imaginable Quantity, or than any the least finite Magnitude, is, I confess, above my Capacity. . . . But to conceive a Part of such infinitely small Quantity, that shall be still infinitely less than it, and consequently though multipliy d infinitely shall never equal the minutest finite Quantity is, I suspect, an infinite Difficulty to any Man whatsoever . . . (Section V)   Do you see what he s complaining about? Berkeley is questioning the very existence of the differentials we have been relying on since we began. And he has a point. As we ve seen our differentials have to satisfy two mutually exclusive properties. They can t be zero but they must be smaller than the least finite Magnitude. On its face this seems to be impossible.  But Berkeley goes further. He says that:    . . . our modern Analysts are not content to consider only the Differences of finite Quantities: they also consider the the Differences of those Differences, and the Differences of the Differences of the first Differences. And so on {ad infinitum. That is, they consider Quantities infinitely less than the least discernible Quantity; and others infinitely less than those infinitely small ones; and still others infinitely less than the preceding Infinitesimals, and so on without end or limit . . . And (which is most strange) although you should take a Million of Millions of these Infinitesimals, each whereof is supposed infinitely greater than some other real Magnitude, and add them to the least given Quantity, it shall be never the bigger. For this is one of the modest postulata of our modern Mathematicians, and it is a Corner-stone or Ground-work of their Speculations. (Section VI)   Clearly Berkeley is contemptuous of the reasoning we ve used to justify our differentiation rules. And, again, he has a point. We have pushed aside issues like this until now because we knew we were showing you the correct techniques, even if our justifications would not bear close examination. In the beginning it was more important that you learn to use Calculus than that you understand all of the logical subtleties that have been used to justify it rigorously.  But wait a second. We know Calculus works. We ve been successfully solving abstruse and difficult problems with it for some time. Throughout the first part of this text we ve seen ample, even overwhelming, evidence of this fact. Isn t that sufficient? Can t we conclude from the fact that it does seem to work that the notion of the differential is tenable after all?  Sadly, no. Berkeley thought of that too:    But this inverted way of demonstrating your Principles by your Conclusions . . . is contrary to the Rules of Logic. The truth of a Conclusion will not prove either the Form or the Matter . . . to be true . . . I say that in every other Science Men prove their Conclusions by their Principles, and not their Principles by their Conclusions. (Section XX)   In order to have confidence in our knowledge, we must begin with simple, clear ideas and build on them logically. Nothing else will do.  However, the path to simple, clear ideas is neither simple nor clear. As we ve mentioned before, it took about two hundred years for the mathematical community to find and fully understand how to make Calculus rigorous. We introduced the essential idea, the limit, intuitively in .   Comment  For us rigorous means that we can provide an argument that even Bishop Berkeley would accept.   It would be possible to introduce the limit concept formally and then proceed to develop all of Calculus from it. Logically, there is nothing wrong with this approach, and indeed, this is exactly how most Calculus books present the topic. But the limit concept is very subtle. Unless you understand exactly what issues it is meant to address it is very difficult to understand why it takes the form that it does.  So, we will continue to build on our intuitive approach. However, our focus has changed. In Part I we worked intuitively to build confidence in the tools we were building. Here in Part II, our intention is to highlight how and where our intuition falls short, so that when we finally define the limit concept rigorously in it will be clear why it must have the form that it does. What this means is that while our intention is to finally provide the rigor we ve been lacking we will not actually achieve that until the end of     Secants and Tangents     Calculus required continuity, and continuity was supposed to require the infinitely little; but nobody could discover what the infinitely little might be.   Bertrand Russell (1872-1970)         In we defined the derivative of to be the differential ratio , but Berkeley shows in The Analyst that there are considerable difficulties with this approach. How else might we define the derivative? This is our next puzzle.  If we want to construct the line tangent at a particular point, on a given curve we immediately have this problem: We only have one point, but there are (infinitely) many lines through that point. A few of them are shown at the right. How could we possibly pick the tangent line out of this mess?  The only distinguishing feature that the tangent line has is that it is in fact tangent to our curve. That is not much to go on. But it is not nothing either.          To form a line we desperately need another point. But where to find one? The only other points we have to work with are points on the curve itself.  Choose a new point, say on our curve but a little to the right of and draw the line between and as shown in the sketch at the left. Recall from that the trigonometric secant function is so called because it is the length of a line segment which cuts the circle. The brown line in this sketch cuts the curve so it is called a secant line .         Similarly, if we choose a point a little to the left of and draw another secant line (shown in purple) it should be clear that the tangent line will be between the two secant lines in the sketch at the right.  We have eliminated a lot of potential tangent lines, but we haven t eliminated all of them. Is there a way we could refine our search to reduce the set of possible tangent lines even further?         Sure. Choose between and and draw the (blue) secant line from to and then choose between and and draw the (green) secant line through them to get the sketch at the left. It is clear that we have eliminated more potential tangent lines, and that by continuing to choose points even closer to we can eliminate even more of them.  This approach seems to have some potential but there are at least two difficulties:   So far we ve relied heavily on diagrams to motivate our approach, and we know that diagrams can be misleading. However this is not as serious as it seems to be because we are only using the diagrams to motivate a new definition for the derivative. Once that definition is in place we can disregard the diagrams and work directly with the definition regardless of the shape of the graph.  You should generate a few graphs of your own, different from ours and from each other, to confirm that our arguments work for them as well.    We ve been drawing the tangent lines but we need to keep in mind that the line tangent to the graph of our function at a point is not the derivative of the function. The derivative is the slope of the tangent line. And slope is a number. The pictures we ve drawn so far are very suggestive but they don t give us numbers.            For the time being, we will handle the first difficulty by ignoring it. That is, we will continue to use diagrams to motivate our ideas, but when we are done we will have circle back and ask ourselves if our reliance on those diagrams has caused us to miss any special cases which need to be addressed.  To handle the second difficulty consider the sketch at the right. It is clear that if the tangent line, , is caught between lines secant lines and , then the slope of is necessarily caught between the slope of and the slope of Thus we have A specific example will be helpful.    Suppose . We would like to compute the derivative (slope of the line tangent to the graph) of at the point by the the procedure indicated above.  Before we start, observe that from our work with differentials we know what we are expecting to get. It is   Taking and gives   So our proposed procedure seems to be heading us in the right direction. If we take and we get We say that is bounded , and that the numbers and are the bounds .      Compute bounds on the derivatives of each function given at by using the values of and given below.                               ,     ,     , and                                                             The results in are looking very promising indeed. Since they are looking so promising we ll take a few minutes to simplify our notation a bit.  It is tedious to have all of these subscripted variables ( ) so we will define an equivalent, but more useful, notation. The basic idea here is that we move to a new point a little bit away from and form the quotient that gives the slope of the secant line at that point. To construct the first secant line we took to be a number a little to the right of . However, if we take to be a positive number near zero then expresses the same idea. Similarly, to construct a secant line a little to the left of we take to be a negative number near zero so that expresses the same idea.         We can capture both situations notationally by agreeing that is a number (either positive or negative) which is close to zero. Thus when is positive the point is to the right, and when is negative the point is to the left of as shown in the diagram at the right.  When we express the idea this way we no longer need to generate all of the independent variables, . We can accomplish the same thing by taking where is some arbitrary real number, which is close to zero. Each value of gives us a different secant line through the point and its slope will be By the Principle of Local Linearity we see that when is very small the quotient will be very close to the the slope of the tangent line.  There is also a small technical matter we need to think about: Do we really need to consider secant lines on either side of (for both positive and negative values of )? Would it not be sufficient to consider just the secant lines on the right formed from the sequence It seems pretty clear that the slopes we get, are getting closer to . Isn t that enough?  No, it is not. But not because there is any inherent logical flaw in doing so. This has more to do with the properties we want the derivative to have than any purely logical consideration, so we ll hold off further discussion until .        Returning to the example at , we let be any number except zero and find of the secant line through and . We can t let be zero because if it is zero then and are the same point and we can t construct the secant line. We must have just to get started. In that case we have        This is interesting. Do you recognize this computation? It should be familiar to you. This is precisely the same computation you did when you used Fermat s adaptation of the Method of Adequality to find tangent lines in . The only difference, really, is that at this point Fermat would simply set and move on. We can t do that because we need two distinct points to specify a (secant) line. If we only have one. This is frustrating because we can see that setting will give us which we know to be the correct value.  Berkeley pointed out the problem of setting in The Analyst (his Increments are what we ve called ):   . . . this reasoning is not fair or conclusive. For when it is said, let the Increments vanish, i.e. let the Increments be nothing, or let there be no Increments, the former Supposition that the Increments were something, or that there were Increments is destroyed, and yet as a Consequence of that Supposition, i.e. an Expression got by virtue thereof, is retained. Which . . . is a false way of reasoning. Certainly when we suppose the Increments to vanish, we must suppose their Proportions, their Expressions, and every thing else derived from the Supposition of their Existence to vanish with them.   Requiring to be non-zero at the beginning of our argument, and zero at the end is tantamount to requiring to be zero and not zero simultaneously which is not possible. So can t be zero. But it can be very close to zero. Moreover as it gets closer to zero ( ) it is clear that . This should also feel very familiar to you. Do you see that we re talking about a limit? From equation we see that as , Moreover, by the Principle of Local Linearity as the secant and tangent lines become indistinguishable. Thus it appears that the limit will be the value of the derivative at .  Our discussion in suggests that we can use the limit concept to finally resolve the logical difficulties inherent in a naive use of the differential as a foundation for Calculus, and that is exactly our present goal.   Historical Background  We say naive because the fact is that the differential concept actually can be made fully rigorous and thus can serve as a foundation for Calculus just as well as the limit theory we are currently pursuing. Such a foundation was built by the mathematician Abraham Robinson is his book Non-Standard Analysis . However Robinson used ideas and techniques from modern mathematical logic which were not available to mathematicians of the seventeenth century. Because they are they are not available to us either, we will justify our methods using the older, slightly simpler, limit theory.   In this second part of this text we will finally build a viable theory to support Calculus which even Bishop Berkeley would have to accept. We begin with the following definition. This is the modern definition of the derivative.   The Derivative    Suppose is a function, and that is a real number. If exists then we say that is differentiable at and that the derivative of at is given by: if this limit exists. If the limit does not exist then the derivative also does not exist at .     defines the derivative locally, at . This may seem to be a mere formality but it is not. When we write it is easy to fall into the habit of thinking of as representing all of the points in the domain of . But that is fundamentally wrong. The variable always represents a single point in the domain of . Always. No exceptions. When its value is unknown we call it (or , or , or Fred, Ethel, Ricky, or Lucy. These are all just names we give to a unknown specific quantity) because this is simpler than saying whatever point we re interested in. This is why the symbol is pronounced of , or at .           In we evaluated the derivative of at the single point . It appears that if we want to evaluate the derivative of at and we need to compute , and .  But it is tedious to compute the derivative of a function one specific point at a time. If we leave unspecified and compute we obtain the value of the derivative of at the single, but unspecified point . We can then find the derivative of at any point by replacing with whatever point we are interested in.       Use the techniques we saw in to compute by evaluating a limit. Check your work by differentiating using differentials.  Do not use L Hôpital s Rule. L Hôpital s Rule as that would be circular reasoning.                                                               When a function is differentiable at all of the points in its domain it is said to be differentiable on its domain or just differentiable .   Comment  In practice we are often quite loose with the term differentiable . Most people would call the functions and  differentiable even though they both fail to be differentiable at .    Which of the functions in are differentiable and which are not? Identify all points of non-differentiability.    Comment  Newton s fluxions are nowhere to be seen, however.   If you look closely at you can see Leibniz differentials lurking in the background. If we let and then for values of very close to zero we have. The approximation gets better as (equivalently, as ) so you can see that avoids the infinitely small by replacing differentials with (equivalently ) which is a small, but finite, number which is only considered in the limit as . In particular, is not an infinitesimal. But it is allowed to become as close to zero as needed while remaining finite in size. Needless to say, limits are much harder to work with than differentials. Their saving grace is if they can be made logically unassailable with a proper definition. Bishop Berkeley would approve.  For the rest of this text we pursue two over-arching goals. The first is to rigorously recapture from all of the differentiation rules we are already familiar with. We will address that in the first section of the next chapter. Keep in mind that we are not developing the differentiation rules. We already know them, and by now you should be quite skillful at their use. Our goal now is to show rigorously that by using we can recapture all of the properties that we found so useful before.  To do this we will need several properties of limits which we will state without proof in the next section. Then we will prove that our differentiation rules and the First Derivative Test are valid using . However all of this will be done under the assumption that the limit properties in the next section are actually true.  Our second goal is to prove, rigorously that the limit properties in the next section are actually true. We will do this in .   "

Now, they invent them deliberately just to invalidate our ancestors' reasoning, and that is all they are ever going to get out of them.   Henri Poincarè (1854-1912)   In this section we will state several theorems about limits which we will need in the sections following. The limit concept is very subtle and our understanding of it is still quite intuitive. We are not yet quite prepared to prove these theorems so we will leave these theorems unproven for now. Our immediate goal is simply to understand what they say and learn how to use them. In the next section we will begin using these theorems to show how the limit in allows us to recapture all of the major results we used in Part I of this text.  In Chapter we will finally discard our intuitive definition of a limit ( ) and formally define both a limit at infinity ( Theorem ) and a limit at a point ( Theorem ). Then we will return to the theorems in this section and (finally) prove rigorously that they are, in fact, true. Until then any result which relies on the theorems in this section should be considered contingent.  In Chapter we stated the following three theorems about limits at infinity.    the limit of a sum is the sum of the limits ( Theorem ),    the limit of a product is the product of the limits ( Theorem ) and,    the limit of a quotient is the quotient of the limits ( Theorem ).

Suppose that the functions and are defined on some open interval about except, possibly, at itself. Then if and then    Notice that in addition to changing to some real number, , we have added two qualifications to the statement of each of these theorems from Chapter :    Suppose that the functions and are defined on some open interval about and,     except, possibly, at itself    To see why these are necessary recall that we're going to use limits to define the derivative as in Theorem so we'll need to evaluate the limit . Clearly the expression is not defined at . But we're only interested in its value in the limit as which means that must be able to get close to . That is, there must be an open interval around where the expression is defined.  But we don't care if is defined at or not. That is irrelevant to our purpose. So we state explicitly that we do not consider whether .  Ok, but why did we insert the word possibly ? Wouldn't it be enough to simply say except at ?  We need to say possibly because these theorems, like all theorems, are stated with as much generality as possible. For example, consider the function . Had we not included possibly in the conditions of our theorems the limit: , which is clearly equal to , would have to be considered undefined because is defined at . This distinction may seem like a very fussy, and unimportant detail right now, but it will be important when we discuss the meaning of continuity in .   Historical Background  In the eighteenth century there was a, public, protracted, and vitriolic argument between Benjamin Robins and James Jurin over exactly this point. Robins would have claimed that the statement is meaningless. Jurin would have said it has meaning because it is obviously true. The point here is not that either man was right or wrong, but rather that it depends on how we define limits. By one definition Robins was correct, by another Jurin was. Their controversy was the result of the incomplete understanding of limits that prevailed at the time.    Suppose Then In particular the limit is not . Here is how we would evaluate this limit using the tools we currently have at our disposal. We're interested in the limit as so in particular we do not need to consider the case when . But as long as we have so As gets close to it is clear that gets close to . Therefore Notice that our reasoning is a little vague in the last step because we had to resort to the phase gets close to, and we know from our work in that this is not a precise phrase. This is the best we can do now because we have not yet rigorously defined a limit. We will do that in .     By reasoning in a manner similar to show that for each function.                           It will be tedious to write (and to read) the phrase Suppose that is defined on some open interval about except, possibly, at itself every time we need it so it is customary to say something more like Suppose is defined near  instead. Because we are trying to be as precise, and rigorous as possible we will formalize this by redefining the word near .   Near    We say that has some property near  if has that property on an open interval about , except possibly at itself.    Notice that this is not what near means in ordinary speech. This is one of the things that makes it difficult to read mathematics. We routinely co-opt words from natural languages (like English) and redefine them to fit our needs. In this case our purpose requires that we change the definition of near slightly as you've seen. Because near is a common word and you have a lifetime of experience using it, it can be very difficult to cast off your preconceptions. The familiar definition you learned in childhood will intrude and cause confusion. It is hard to overcome this. Refer back to the definition frequently until you have internalized the mathematical definition.  We have the following theorem.   The Limit of a Constant is the Constant  Theorem Limit of a Constant is the Constant  Suppose and are real numbers, and near . Then    Notice that Theorem would be considerably less useful had we not required that for near , rather than on its entire domain. For example, as stated Theorem allows us to conclude that if then and because there are open intervals about and where , and , respectively.  Since there is no such interval about , is undefined.    Find an open interval about where .    Find an open interval about where .

Explain why this does not contradict Theorem .      Suppose near and exists. Use to show that if then .    Consider for near .     Comment  This problem shows that if then the only way that can exist is if we have a L Hôpital Indeterminate. It can also be used to prove Lemma as you will see when we get to it.   The following Corollary says that if is approaching and we multiply by a number, , then the product approaches . It follows from Theorem and Theorem .   If and is a real number then     Prove Corollary .   The concept of continuity is essential to Calculus, but you may have noticed that we have carefully avoided it as much as possible until now. This is because defining continuity is similar to defining the line tagent to a curve ( ). We need to think carefully about what we want the term continuous to mean, and then craft our definition to capture that meaning. This would have been very difficult to do without a fairly sophisticated understanding of the limit concept.  So stop and think about this for a moment. What do we mean when we say a curve is continuous ? A first, intuitive definition usually goes something like this: A function is continuous if you can draw its graph without lifting your pencil from the paper, but this is unsatisfactory for a number of reasons. In particular, it is impossible to apply in most cases. Think about it. How often have you seen the entire graph of any function? Usually we just draw the part neat the origin and put arrowheads on both ends of the graph. We need something more precise.  At the end of we remarked that it is only when is continuous at that is equal to , but we did not discuss the matter any further. It is time for that discussion.  First, notice that when you think closely about the statement is continuous at it appears to be nonsense, because is the value of at the single value . Does it make sense to you that a curve can be continuous at a single value of its domain? In ordinary usage the concept of continuity requires an interval to be continuous on, doesn't it?  Since we need the concept of continuity at a point, we define it.   Continuity at a Point    A function , whose domain is an interval in , is continuous at in the interval, if and only if , (alternatively, if ).          If is continuous at every point in its domain we'll just call it a continuous function.  The sketch below shows that recovers the intuitive notion that a function is continuous if we can draw its graph without lifting pen from page. Both of the functions, and are identical everywhere except at . Clearly, to draw , which is discontinuous at since . We must lift our pen from the page to draw the graph of . None of this is true of the graph of , which is continuous.   The following lemma is true and the proof will be valid once the limit theorems have been proven in .   Differentiability Implies Continuity  If is differentiable at then is also continuous at      Use the result of to prove .    When we were studying horizontal asymptotes in we encountered (the Squeeze Theorem at Infinity). But the Squeeze Theorem is also valid if , where is a real number.   The Squeeze Theorem (The Finite Case)  Theorem Squeeze Theorem (The Finite Case)  If for near and then also.    is illustrated below, but a formal proof will not be given until . Notice that on the interval  is caught between ( squeezed by ) and .      Consider the two functions defined in the sketch below:        Use to show that is continuous at .   What functions is caught between?    Use to show that is not continuous at .   Try the substitution for . What would look like in terms of ?                   The Limit of a Composition is the Composition of the Limits  Theorem Limit of a Composition is the Composition of the Limits   Suppose and that is continuous at . Then    Essentially this says that we can interchange the function and the symbols if is continuous at .     The General Differentiation Theorems, via Limits   . . . one way in math to take care of destabilizing problems is to legislate them out of existence . . . by loading theorems with stipulations and exclusions designed to head off crazy results.   David Foster Wallace (1962-2008)   Since we will now be proving the the differentiation rules rigorously we will call them what they really are: Theorems. Because limits are much less intuitive than differentials we'll want to be as efficient as possible when using them. The sooner we can build up some tools to make things easier, the better.  Also, in this section we will add a new differentiation rule (theorem): The Chain Rule. Or rather, we will give a name to an already familiar technique and elevate it's status by providing a formal proof. Proving the Chain, Product, and Quotient Differentiation Rules using limits will require a good deal of cleverness. These proofs will also uncover some unexpected subtleties along the way.  Before we begin there is one more point that needs to be clear. Because differentiation is now defined via a limit and limits are defined at a point we can only differentiate a function at a point. We usually say that limit evaluation and differentiability are local properties . If we don't specify the at the convention is that the function is differentiable at every point in its domain.  The proofs of the Constant, Sum, and Constant Multiple Differentiation Rules are all completely straightforward so we will leave them as exercises for you.   Comment  Frequently students will simply ignore problems that are described as straightforward. Don't make that mistake. Straightforward does not mean easy, and it does not mean unimportant. We are leaving these problems for you so you can gain experience using limits in the simplest cases, not because they are unimportant.    The Constant Rule for Differentiation  Theorem Constant Rule for Differentiation  If is some number and for all real values of near (on an open interval around) , then at every real number near (on the same open interval) .    By  But so        The Sum Rule for Differentiation  If and are differentiable at and , then is also differentiable at and      Use Definition to prove the Sum Rule for Differentiation.    Recall that when we first established the General Differentiation Rules using differentials in Chapter we said that the Constant Multiple, Power and Quotient Rules for differentiation were just conveniences because they depend on the other rules.  This is still true of course (except for the caveat in the point of rigor below) which means that we don't have to prove any of them using limits. For example, since the Constant Rule and the Product Rule are now established theorems we can use these to prove the Constant Multiple Rule directly, without having to resort to using limits.   The Constant Multiple Rule for Differentiation  If is differentiable at and is a constant then is also differentiable and      Use the to prove the Constant Multiple Rule.      The Chain Rule  To understand the Chain Rule we will need to slightly blur the distinction between function and variable.   Here's what we mean: The formula , is given entirely in terms of the variables , and . To differentiate using differentials we would make the (variable) substitution so that . In that case, , and dividing through by gives us the derivative of with respect to ,   But requires that we think about functions, not variables so let's translate this problem into the language of functions. If , clearly is a function of (depends on) . Naming that function , we have . Replacing with , we get .  Similarly, if then is also a function of (depends on) , and naming that function we have . Replacing with we have . If we suppress the part of , we see that can also be thought of as a function of (depends on) so that is also a valid representation of our function. If we now define we see that   Looking again at equation , and mixing the differential and functional notations a bit we see that   Thus if is the composition of and then This is the Chain Rule. We have expressed the Chain Rule in this form so that we can prove it rigorously, not so that we can use it. The substitution process using differentials still works so there is no reason to stop using substitution when you are actually computing derivatives.    The Chain Rule  Theorem Chain Rule  Suppose that is differentiable at , that is differentiable at and that near . Then the composition,\\\\ \\centerline{ } is also differentiable, and     DIGRESSION: The Origins of the Chain Rule  Digression The Origins of the Chain Rule  Before the invention of Calculus, arithmetic primers gave the name The Chain Rule to the computational technique that is used to, among other things, convert money from one currency to another. For example if we need to convert American dollars ($) to British pounds (£) but we only know their values ie euros (€). Specifically we know that (These numbers were accurate on the day this passage was written. They are almost certainly wrong on the day you are reading it. Don't use them to convert currency.) Then the conversion is   We've actually seen this type of conversion before. In Section we converted angular velocity to linear velocity via the formula:   A similar chain of cancellations will occur when we differentiate a function composition of the form . We think of   Putting this all together we see that   The substitution we used to make things easier on your eyes in Section is equivalent this chain of cancellations. With the invention of Calculus the older Chain Rule for unit conversion was extended to the differentiation by substitution technique using differentials. Eventually the older usage was dropped and this became the only Chain Rule. When the limit was used to provide rigor to Calculus the name was also applied to equation ).  END OF DIGRESSION   Understanding the Chain Rule in this form requires that we blur the distinction between function and variable a bit. When we compute (the derivative of with with respect to ) we view as a variable, but when we compute (the derivative of with respect to ) we view it as a function.  As far as the Chain Rule is concerned it is both.   Before we begin take specific notice of the assumption near in the statement of the Chain Rule. We will have a few comments about this in Digression: Why Assume That Near Zero? after the proof is completed.  We will first establish that   Suppose that    Comment  Because asserting the equality of non-existing objects would be meaningless we assume, implicitly that all limits in this argument exist.   Then from which follows. To prove the Chain Rule recall that    Comment  In the past we have called this uncancelling  . Also, notice that this is where we use the assumption, near .    Multiplying by in the form gives In equation  is first used as a variable in , and then as the function . While this is correct, it is also poor form because it accentuates the dual use of . To avoid this we usually express the Chain Rule as to emphasize that , not , is the variable.       DIGRESSION: Why Assume That Near Zero?  Do you see why we had to assume that near ?  Observe that in equation  plays the same role the plays in . In we were careful to insist that could never equal zero,so if we are going to interpret as the derivative of with respect to , as we did in equation , we need to know that when is near zero.  Our imposition of that constraint means that does not apply to any function where might be equal to zero no matter how close is to zero. Fortunately, functions of that sort are generally the kinds of pathological functions that Poincarè is complained about in the quote at the beginning of this chapter. A valid proof of the Chain Rule without that constraint is possible, but since it would have very little relevance to anything we'll be doing we have chosen to prove only this weaker form of the Chain Rule   Comment  You may be wondering if our choice to go with a weaker form of the Chain Rule means we've given Bishop Berkeley cause for complaint. The answer is no, we haven't. If we'd left off the condition that , then our proof would not have been rigorous because we'd have ended by claiming more than we'd proved. As it is, we've only claimed what we have proved.  Rigorous does not mean perfect, it means logical.   If you are unsatisfied with this proof and want to see a proof of the stronger version of the Chain Rule, consider majoring in mathematics. You'll see that and much, much more. In the meantime try working through the following problem.        Show that the function does not satisfy the constraint when is near zero.   Recall .    As a result of part (a) does not apply to any of the following functions at . Nevertheless one of them is differentiable at . Use to find out which one.                                                                 END OF DIGRESSION    Suppose that . To use the Chain Rule to compute the derivative of we need to recognize that is the composition of , and and then apply as follows.    In our opinion the Chain Rule leaves a lot to be desired as a computational technique. But we don't have to use it that way since validates the substitutions we have always used.   Suppose . Compute the differential and then divide through by to find the derivative . Confirm that it is the same as the derivative we found in .     Compute for each of the following functions by identifying and such that and applying the Chain Rule. You may have to do this more than once for a given problem. In each case confirm that your computation is correct with an appropriate differential substitution.                                    The Product Rule  A rigorous proof of the Product Rule is also fairly complex, but it does not suffer from the kind of technical problems we encountered in the proof of the Chain Rule.   The Product Rule for Differentiation  Theorem Product Rule for Differentiation  If and are differentiable at then is differentiable and      We start with two observations. The first is that and the second is that, in limit form, equation is It appears then that our goal is simply to reorganize equation until it looks like equation . We say simply but it will only appear to be simple after we have succeeded. We will proceed slowly.  Observe that if we subtract from the blue part of the numerator in equation we get whereas if we add to the red part of the numerator in equation we get This suggests that we should both add and subtract the expression to the numerator of equation . Doing this and factoring as we've indicated above we get By we can separate this into the limit of the two fractions as follows: and by we see that and therefore                                                                         The Other General Differentiation Rules   The Quotient Rule for Differentiation  Theorem Quotient Rule for Differentiation   We assume that , , and are all differentiable functions\\aside{Notice that we have explicitly assumed that the quotient }. Assume further that . Then    Proving this directly by using limits would be unpleasant, but as we observed in the Quotient Rule can be viewed as a rearranged version of the Product Rule.    Use the Product Rule to derive the Quotient Rule.    First solve for .    With the Product Rule for Differentiation in place we now have the tools needed to prove the Power Rule for Positive Integer Exponents. The method of proof we outline in the following problem is called Mathematical Induction and it can be used in other contexts as well. In fact, most of the Find the Pattern problems in this text require an Induction argument for full rigor.   The Power Rule for Positive Integer Exponents   Assume that is differentiable at for any positive integer .    Assume that . Use the limit definition to show that (This says, The Power Rule holds for . )    Now assume that the Power Rule for Positive Integer Exponents holds for , where is an arbitrary, fixed positive integer. Let and show that (This says, If the Power Rule holds for then it must also hold for . )               Do you see how this proves that the Power Rule holds for any positive integer, ? Write a short paragraph explaining the logic behind this.    Parts (a) and (b) of this problem constitute a proof of the Power Rule for Positive Integer Exponents by Mathematical Induction , and part (c) asks you to explain the underlying logic. Although we didn t mention it at the time, Mathematical Induction was the underlying idea in part (d) of as well.  With the Power Rule for Positive Integer Exponents in place we can extend it to both negative and rational exponents in the same way we did it in . The following problem is essentially a repeat of  and , using Lagrange's prime notation, and function notation, rather than differentials.   The Power Rule for Rational and Negative Exponents       Assume is a positive integer and that is differentiable. Show that    Rewrite as and use the Quotient Rule for Differentiation and the Power Rule for positive integers.    Assume that is a non-zero integer and that is differentiable at . Show that    Rewrite as and use the Chain Rule and the Power Rule for positive integers.    Assume that and are integers, , and that is differentiable at . Show that    Rewrite as and use the Chain Rule and part (b).                         Together the previous two problems prove the Power Rule for rational exponents:   The Power Rule for Rational Exponents  Theorem Power Rule for Rational Exponents  Assume that and are integers, , and that is differentiable at . Then    In the statement of we explicitly assumed that the quotient, , is differentiable at . This has the effect that the theorem does not necessarily apply to all possible quotients, in the same way that when we add to the statement of the Chain Rule, the theorem applies to fewer compositions. And just like the Chain Rule the functions that does not apply to are mostly pathological, and of no use to us right now.  We added the same assumption to for similar reasons.   DIGRESSION: Are You a Mathematician?  Digression Are You a Mathematician?  If leaving these theorems incomplete in this way is troubling to you then you are almost certainly a mathematician by temperament. If you haven't decided on a major yet, consider mathematics. You obviously like it. Why not learn more?  If you find that you simply don't care about completing all of the details and you are not majoring in mathematics, congratulations! You've made the right choice.   will lead you through the steps necessary to prove the Quotient Rule for Differentiation without the assumption that is differentiable. Have fun!    Assume that and are differentiable and that , but we make no assumption about the differentiability of .    First prove the special case of the Quotient Rule where .   Use the limit definition to show that .    Now evaluate the limit in part (i) to show that .       Use the Product Rule for Differentiation and the Chain Rule (along with the result of part a) to show that is differentiable at and that                                    will lead you through the steps necessary to prove the Product Rule for Rational Exponents without the assumption that is differentiable. It relies on the result of . Have fun!    To prove we will first focus on the special case of where is a non-negative integer.  The key to proving this special case is a generalization of the difference of squares formula:     Show that .    Show that .    Use Mathematical Induction to show that .

Then     Showing that the derivative of is is mostly straightforward but we're going to hit a snag partway through. We'll proceed for a bit to see where the trouble is. Start with the limit definition: In the numerator we see the expression . Recall the sum formula for the Sine: Taking and we have: If the values of the two limits are and respectively as we've indicated we can conclude that . Unfortunately this proof cannot be considered complete until we have shown that these last two limits are what we claim they are. We will do this via the two lemmas below.      It is tempting to use L Hôpital s Rule to evaluate the two limits at the end of , especially since it is so very easy to do. See below.   Use L Hôpital s Rule to show     .     Sadly, using to finish the proof of is an example of circular reasoning. We can't use the fact that the derivative of is to prove that the derivative of is . So we will have to find a way to evaluate these limits without using L Hôpital s Rule.        Proof         There are two cases:   Case 1  : We will use the Squeeze Theorem. Recall that in we observed that the lengths of certain line segments associated with the unit circle in the first quadrant are equal to the trigonometric functions. The figure at the right shows the relationship between , , and . Notice in particular that Dividing each expression in the inequality by almost does the trick: In the center we now have the reciprocal of what we need, so we need to invert each expression. However, keep in mind that these are not equations they are inequalities. When we invert an inequality we must reverse its sense. This gives and this is true on the interval . Since the Squeeze Theorem applies, and we conclude that    Case 2  : For this case notice that so that . We make the substitution where . Therefore when we have by Case 1.        Show that .\\\\    It is tempting to model this proof on the proof of . While this can be done, it is delicate. It is simpler to multiply by in the form . Try that instead.    Once has been solved the proof that is complete.    Prove that , using the proof of as a guide.    Assuming that , , , and are differentiable we can now use to find their derivatives as well. Since this is exactly what we did in we have the derivatives of all of the trigonometric functions.    Inverse Functions  Although we have worked with the inverses of some specific functions we have not formally defined what we mean by an inverse. We will remedy that now. We have seen that not all functions can be inverted (see for example,  so the first step is to define which functions are invertible.  Informally a function that never takes the same value twice is called a one-to-one function . Formally we have the following.   Mathematical Terminology  They are also called injective .    One-To-One Functions   A function, , defined on a domain, , is said to be one-to-one if, whenever and are in and then, .    Recall that when we tried to invert (which is not one-to-one) in we got the multifunction . We had to restrict the domain of the tangent function to , in order to find an inverse. That restriction gave us a one-to-one function which we could invert because one-to-one functions are the only functions with inverses.   Inverse Functions    Suppose , with domain and range, is a one-to-one function. Then the inverse of is the function with domain and range which satisfies the following properties (Notice that the domain and range have been swapped.):            for every value of in the domain of (equivalently, in the range of ).    Loosely speaking, says that two functions are mutually inverse if they undo each other.  Our next task is to show that the derivatives of the in inverse trigonometric functions are what we expect them to be. Given that we have now obtained the derivatives of all of the trigonometric functions it appears that we could proceed just as we did in and .  But that would require that we explicitly assume that each of the inverse trigonometric functions is differentiable, similar to the way we found the derivative of a quotient. This is a valid approach of course, but proceeding in that manner would mask some issues that will be of interest to us later. So we will approach the derivatives of inverse functions abstractly by (rigorously) finding a formula for the derivative of the inverse of a generic, invertible function. After that we'll only need to apply the formula to each of the inverse trigonmetric formulas.   DIGRESSION: Inverse and Derivative Notation  As we saw in DIGRESSION: Inverse Function Notation there are some difficulties with the notation we use to indicate inverse functions. These problems only get worse when we mix the standard derivative notations with the inverse function notation. Lagrange's prime notation is especially problematic.  For example if is an invertible function the derivative of could be denoted either as: or .  But both of these are somewhat awkward. Mathematicians also sometimes use the operator notation: and in this situation it minimizes the awkwardness a bit.  As we've seen there can also be some vagueness involving the distinction between functions and variables. For example suppose we want to sketch a graph of this relation between and : The simplest thing to do is to choose a value for either or and then figure out what the corresponding or is. This is simpler to do that if we rearrange the relation so that we have one variable strictly in terms of ( as a function of ) the other. For this particular relation it is easiest to choose a value for and compute the corresponding value so we would normally rearrange it as  equation defines as a function of .  But we only solved for because we could see it was a little easier to do. Otherwise our choice was completely arbitrary. We could also have solved for giving, In this case we have as a function of .  The two functions, , ( cube ) and ( cube root ), clearly contain the same information as the original relation . But they are different, related, functions. They are in fact mutually inverse.  For example suppose we choose and use equation to find . If we then take and use equation we find that . That is, has undone  for the single pair . asks you to show that it is true for every pair . This undoing makes and a pair of mutually inverse functions.  But in function notation the variable (frequently or ) is a placeholder. For example, each of  , , or even defines exactly the same function: The function which cubes its input. It doesn't matter what we call the variable. It just holds a place in the formula that tells us what the input is and what to do with it. Since it doesn't matter what we call the variable we usually call it unless there is some compelling reason to use something else.  To avoid confusing variable names with function names we usually denote as . It's inverse, should probably be denoted as . But sadly, recognizing that the variable is just a placeholder in function notation we use the same variable name in both the function and it's inverse. So we denote the inverse of as , even though it would probably make it easier for beginners to use , as a reminder that both functions come from the same original relation.    Prove that and are mutually inverse by showing that they satisfy the conditions stated in    The notation for inverse functions is not great. It can be very confusing, especially for beginners. Be careful with it.  END OF DIGRESSION   Our next task is to show that if is invertible and differentiable, then is also differentiable\\aside{ is obviously invertible}. We do this by showing that the limit exists.  In general this is true but there is one exception that has to be addressed. When is differentiable at and then the limit in equation does not exist. Hence is not differentiable at . More formally, we have the following lemma.   If is an invertible function, , is differentiable at , and , then is not differentiable at . That is does not exist.   The following proof of this lemma is very challenging to read and understand for several reasons.  First, it is quite abstract. We don't have a particular function to think about so we can't simply write down formulas for the function and its inverse. Instead we have only the generic function, and its inverse , and we'll need to remember what these symbols represent.  Second, we need to think about the functions and as well as their derivatives.  Third, instead of using the differential notation, that we've grown very comfortable with we'll be using the less familiar Lagrange prime notation and the operator notation we just introduced.  Finally, the nature of the problem forces us to mix these last two notations, using one here and the other there. This can make for difficult reading.  Read slowly. Remember that each symbol has meaning. Take time to understand that meaning and what each formula as a whole is telling you.  We include this proof in its full abstraction for two reasons:   To be as precise and as rigorous and we can.    We want to give you practice with higher level abstract reasoning in this (fairly) simple case.      Sherlock Holmes Maxim The strategy behind the following proof follows the same general scheme as the Sherlock Holmes Maxim that we referred to in  impossible so that whatever remains, however improbable, must be the truth.   There are two possibilities: Either the derivative of exists or it does not exist. There are two steps:   Assume that the derivative of does exist at and calculate what must be.    Show that our computed value is impossible. Then á la Holmes' Maxim the only possibility left will be that the derivative of does not exist at .      Assume that is differentiable at .   Comment  To be clear, we don't really believe this assumption. Be sure you are very clear on this point. We make this assumption so that we can use it to derive an absurd result; a contradiction. If there are no errors in our reasoning then the only possible conclusion will be that this assumption is false: is not differentiable at .   Because and are mutually inverse we know that Therefore On the right we have On the left apply the Chain Rule: But when we find that , so that or which is ridiculous or in Holmes' word, impossible. Therefore our assumption cannot true so is not differentiable at .      While valid and correct, this proof is not very enlightening. A well chosen sketch would be much more convincing, if less rigorous.    Choose a function whose derivative is equal to zero at some point and sketch the graph of your function and its inverse on the same set of axes. Be sure to include the point where the derivative is zero. Use your graph to explain why the derivative of the inverse of your function does not exist.    We now understand what conditions are necessary for an arbitrary function, , to have a differentiable inverse.  Also, from we know what the derivative of the inverse will be if it exists:    Let and explain how the formula above is equivalent to    The only thing left is to show that under the conditions on in the derivative (that is, the limit which defines the derivative) of the inverse does in fact exist.   The Derivative of Inverse Functions  Theorem Derivative of an Inverse Function  Suppose that    is differentiable at ,     ,     ,     is continuous at .      Comment  In fact, the continuity of follows from the continuity of at . We do not have all of the tools necessary to prove this so we must include it in the assumptions of our theorem.   Then the inverse of is differentiable at and    Reading and understanding the notation in presents the same difficulties we saw in the proof of . Read it carefully. Be patient with yourself and do not rush.   Proof of  We want to show that the limit Since we know that so that The expression would be if only we had instead of . What we need to show now is that if then . Then we could write and our proof would be complete. Written a little more carefully, what we need to show is that . Recall that , and that so we need to show that or But we assumed that is continuous at which means that and the proof is complete. One last point: On the left side of the variable is and on the right it is . While this is not strictly wrong it is a more useful theorem if we state it in terms of alone. Since we see that so and the proof is complete.         Using we can now show that the derivatives of the inverse trigonometric functions and the natural logarithm are exactly what we expect them to be. The difference is that now there is no uncertainty or vagueness in our foundations. No modern Bishop Berkeley can step in and sew doubt.   The Derivative of the Inverse Sine  Suppose Then so      Use to show that each of the following differentiation rules is correct:                                                   Wait a minute! Did we forget one? What about the natural exponential function? Don't we also have to show that ?   Look back at and explain why it is not necessary to use limits to show that .    "

  "title": "The First Derivative Test, Redux",
  "body": " The First Derivative Test, Redux     Geometry has always been considered as an exact science, and indeed as the source of the exactness which is widespread among other parts of mathematics. . . But it seems that this feature of exactness does not reign anymore in geometry since the new system of infinitely small quantities has been mixed to it. I do not see that this system has produced anything for the truth and it would seem to me that it often conceals mistakes.   Michel Rolle (1652-1719)   Assuming that all of the properties of limits we talked about in Section can be proved, we have seen that all of the differentiation rules we developed intuitively using differentials in Chapter can be made rigorous using limits.  The question we need to address now is this: Does the need for rigor, which prompted our definition of the derivative ), get in the way of practical applications such as, say, the First Derivative Test? We will show that such a practical result can still be achieved while maintaining rigor. To do this, we will need a theorem that allows us to relate instantaneous changes to finite changes. The French name for this theorem is le théorème des accroissements finis (translated literally as the Theorem of Finite Increments ). In English it is called the the Mean Value Theorem. We will see how this powerful theorem can be used to transition from theoretical to practical.    Fermat s Theorem   It is by logic that we prove, but by intuition that we discover.   Henri Poincaré (1854-1912)   It is actually a little surprising how much effort it takes to prove the First Derivative Test. We will start by proving some preliminary results that will make it a little easier to follow the logic behind the proof of the First Derivative Test. We ll begin with ( Fermat s Theorem ) which says that if attains a maximum (or minimum) at then More formally:   Fermat s Theorem  Theorem Fermat s Theorem  If is a local extremum (either a maximum or a minimum) of at , and is differentiable at then .   Recall that Fermat gs Theorem does not say that if then is an extremum. In fact, we know that this is not true. Rather, it states the converse: If we know that is an extremum and exists, then .  It is very rare that we can develop a proof of a theorem by directly writing down the logical steps in order. Usually the process takes a lot of trying, backtracking, trying again, and so on much as we described in our analogy in Chapter about finding your way out of a forest.  Of course, in a textbook it is not practical to list all of the bad ideas we might have just to see that they are, in fact, bad ideas. So we will use the following Scrapwork construct when we are just thinking about a problem. The scrapwork is not the proof. The purpose of scrapwork is to engage our intuition and to begin organizing our intuitive understanding so that a rigorous proof will emerge. So, not every statement we make inside a scrapwork construct will necessarily be fully rigorous. If you see a gap in the logic inside a scrapwork construct watch to see how it gets filled in the proof.              Notice that in Definition the quantity is the slope of a particular secant line, as in the sketch below.   If is a (local) maximum then the slope of the secant line in our diagram, , must be negative when . Since the slope is less than zero it follows that     Draw a similar diagram to convince yourself that must also be greater than or equal to zero when .   We can now rigorously prove Fermat s Theorem.   Proof of Fermat s Theorem  We will only prove the case when is a local maximum. The case of a local minimum is very similar. Since is a local maximum there is an interval containing such that for any (sufficiently small that is also in the interval), . Thus as seen in the sketch above. If then and so However if then The only way that inequalities in Formulas and ) can be both true is if         Use our proof of the maximum case as a guide to constructing a proof of Fermat s Theorem when is a local minimum.      Rolle s Lemma and the Mean Value Theorem    Michel Rolle (1659-1719)           Were he alive today Michel Rolle might be horrified to know that his lemma has become a fundamental part of the modern development of Calculus. Like Bishop Berkeley, he was an early critic of Calculus, having once described it as a collection of ingenious fallacies.    Rolle s Lemma  Suppose is continuous on the closed interval and differentiable on the open interval . Suppose further that . Then there is at least one number , in the interval such that .              When Rolle s Lemma is visualized, as in the sketch above, it is clear what is going on. If then between the points and the graph of will either rise to a maximum or drop to a minimum (not shown) at some point . In either case, by Fermat s Theorem, the derivative of at will be zero. Notice that the slope of the line through and is also zero. Thus these two lines are parallel.  Despite the clarity of our sketch, an analytic proof is still required because our sketch does not capture all of the possible ways that Rolle s Lemma can manifest. This is demonstrated in Drill below.    Sketch the graph of a function (different from the one in our sketch) which satisfies all of the conditions of Rolle s Lemma and convince yourself that the conclusion of Rolle s Lemma must still be true.    Show that the condition that is continuous on is necessary by sketching the graph of a function which violates only that condition and the conclusion of Rolle s Lemma.    Show that the condition that is differentiable on is necessary by sketching the graph of a function which violates only that condition and the conclusion of Rolle s Lemma.                       Proof of Roll s Lemma  By the Extreme Value Theorem there are points and in the interval , such that is a global maximum, and is a global minimum. There are two possibilities for and :   Case 1:   Both and are endpoints of the interval.   In this case since the global maximum and the global minimum are equal. The only way that can happen is if the function is constant on the interval , and if is constant then for every in the interval . So we take to be any point in .    Case 2:   At least one of or is not an endpoint of the interval.   In this case by Fermat s Theorem, either , or . So we take or as appropriate.   In either case the existence of in the interval , with is guaranteed.       Digression: Theorems and Lemmas  Digression Theorems and Lemmas   Mathematical Nomneclature  Technically speaking, a statement is not a theorem until it has actually been proved. Until then it is a conjecture.   The distinction between a theorem and a lemma is very slight and rather arbitrary. Typically we call a statement a theorem if it is important and requires proof. We call it a lemma if it requires proof itself, and is used to simply the proof of a theorem. This is not a hard-and-fast rule by any means. Sometimes we first prove a lemma as an aid to proving a theorem, only to find that the lemma is actually more important. However, having been originally dubbed a lemma the result is known ever after as a lemma. For example, in the present instance we will be using the Extreme Value, and Fermat s Theorems to prove what often called Rolle s Lemma , and then use use Rolle s Lemma to prove the Mean Value Theorem . Then we will use the Mean Value Theorem to prove the First Derivative Test . It is all very chaotic.   Comment  We will not be proving the Extreme Value Theorem in this text. Although it appears to be obviously true (read it again and see), it is remarkably hard to prove in a fully rigorous fashion. If you feel that you must see the proof you should change your major to mathematics and take a course in Real Analysis.   END OF DIGRESSION    The Mean Value Theorem  Theorem Mean Value Theorem  Suppose is continuous on some closed interval, , and is differentiable on . Then there is at least one number in the open interval such that     The Mean Value Theorem (visualized below) says that there is a point , in the interval such that the tangent line at and the line through and are parallel. Thus in the special case where the Mean Value Theorem reduces to Rolle s Lemma. In other words the Mean Value Theorem is a generalization of Rolle s Lemma.            We said we would use Rolle s Lemma to prove the Mean Value Theorem. To do that we ll need to create a function -- we ll call it -- that satisfies all of the conditions of Rolle s Lemma . From the diagram at the left we have Do you see that is the function we need?    Show that .    is a straight line and we have the coordinates of two points, and on the line.     Show that from the diagram above satisfies all of the conditions of Rolle s Lemma. That is, show that:     is continuous on .     is differentiable on .                    Proof of the Mean Value Theorem  Observe that satisfies all of the conditions of Rolle s Lemma. Therefore, by Rolle s Lemma there is a point , between and such that . Therefore and so which completes the proof.      As we mentioned at the beginning of this chapter in French the Mean Value Theorem is known as the théorème des accroissements finis or literally the theorem of the finite increments.   To see why this is an accurate description let . Then and . So we can re-express equation ) as . In this form it is clear that the Mean Value Theorem relates the finite increments and to the instantaneous rate of change .  The English name, Mean Value Theorem comes from interpreting the derivative as an instantaneous velocity. If represents time and represents position at time , then is the average velocity in the time interval . Since is instantaneous velocity at time , the conclusion of the Mean Value Theorem is that at some point in that interval, instantaneous velocity must match average (mean) velocity. For example, if you travel miles in one hour then your average velocity is . But it is unlikely that you traveled at exactly for the entire hour. However, at one instant (possibly more) you had to have been traveling at exactly . This is the Mean Value Theorem. It provides the bridge we need to get from infinitesimals to finite intervals.    The Proof of the First Derivative Test  We stated Theorem in Chapter without stating the conditions that make it true, because at the time our attention was primarily on using it.  Since the focus of our attention here is on what makes the First Derivative Test true we will restate it to reflect our new, and deeper, understanding. Notice that the conclusion is the same, only the conditions have changed.   First Derivative Test  Theorem First Derivative Test  Suppose is continuous on the interval , and differentiable on the interval . Suppose further that both and are in the interval and .   If on the interval then . (That is, the function is increasing on .)    If on the interval then . (That is, the function is decreasing on .)       Proof of Part of  We want to use the Mean Value Theorem on the interval so we begin by verifying that the conditions of the Mean Value Theorem are satisfied on that interval. Observe that is a subinterval of so is continuous on and differentiable on . By the Mean Value Theorem there is a number, , in the interval such that Since both and are positive, must be positive as well. Therefore         Prove part of the First Derivative Test in two different ways:    By modifying our proof of part of the First Derivative Test as needed.    Let and apply part of this problem. (Don t forget to show first that satisfies the conditions of the Mean Value Theorem.)               While we are in this frame of mind, we ll take a moment to notice that we can use the Mean Value Theorem to prove, rigorously, something that we have alluded to a few times but have never addressed directly. It is clear from our differentiation rules that if two functions differ by a constant, then they have the same derivative. We ve mentioned that the converse is true, namely if two functions have the same derivative on an interval then they must differ by a constant. % For example, see This can be proved in a manner similar to the proof above.        Suppose on the interval and that and are two points in that interval. Use an argument similar to the proof of the first derivative test to show that .    Explain how the result of part (a) says that must be constant on .    Show that if on the interval , then for some constant .   Consider the function .    What can be said if for all in some set which is not an interval?                    We did not prove L Hôpital s Rule in Chapter because the general theorem is slightly beyond the scope of this text. But the somewhat simpler special case , is a straightforward consequence of the Mean Value Theorem.        Under the conditions of explain why     Apply the Mean Value Theorem to the numerator and denominator in part (a) and then prove .   Use the fact that in the statement of  is between and .                  "

  "body": " When the Derivative Doesn't Exist    One Sided Limits   I turn away with fright and horror from the lamentable evil of functions which do not have derivatives.   Charles Hermite (1822-1901)    The brilliant Cerebron, . . . discovered three distinct kinds of dragon: the mythical, the chimerical, and the purely hypothetical. They were all, one might say, nonexistent, but each non-existed in an entirely different way.   Stanislaw Lem (1921-2006)   In we saw that those points where the derivative doesn't exist are possible optimal points but we didn't pursue this any further at the time. However we now need to re-examine the non-existence of derivatives.  We also observed in that derivatives fail to exist at points where the Principle of Local Linearity does not hold. This is true, but the only way we currently have to determine if the Principle of Local Linearity holds is to look at a graph. While graphs are useful, we have learned that we should not put all of our faith in what we conclude from them.  On the other hand, by the derivative of a function is given by a limit, and from our work in Chapter we know that not all limits exist. For example, if we try to compute the value of for some function and we find that is meaningless then is not differentiable at . In other words, does not exist.  So, the limit definition gives us a computational tool we can use to decide the question of differentiability which, as we saw in Chapter , is crucial to finding possible optimal transition points of a function.  In our comments following we listed several functions which are not differentiable at . Of these, the Absolute Value function, , is probably the simplest to work with, so we will start there.   The Absolute Value Function  The Absolute Value function is usually introduced with some vague statement like,    The absolute value of a number is just the positive version of the number,    or    gives the length of the line segment between and .    These are both true statements and are OK as intuitive definitions, but we will need something more precise from now on.   The formal definition of the Absolute Value function is:   The Absolute Value Function   The Absolute Value of is: .          The graph of the Absolute Value function is given below. Notice that is defined at since , but as we indicated in the Principle of Local Linearity does not hold at so we suspect that the Absolute Value function is not differentiable at .   But we now have the ability to confirm our suspicion analytically so let's take a look at this using the limit definition of the derivative. The derivative of at will be the value of the limit so the derivative of at will be: OK, but what is this limit? Don't jump to conclusions. Think about this carefully for a few minutes. What do you think is equal to?   Comment  To say that is approaching  suggests that is sliding along the horizontal axis toward the origin. We encourage you to think of limits this way. It is a good intuitive approach. However, as we will see in it isn't quite what is really happening.   First suppose that is approaching zero from the positive side. Recall that in we invented the notation for exactly this situation. In this case is positive so and which says that the right-hand limit will be one. Now suppose is very small and negative. In this case is negative so and which says that the left-hand limit will be negative one.  But since can't be close to and close to simultaneously we can not find a value for which is correct for both positive and negative values of . In other words this limit does not exist.  Therefore does not exist either.   According to , since does not exist, the value is a possible transition point for the Absolute Value function. So there might be a local extremum of at . Is there?     The Absolute Value function is not differentiable at but it is differentiable at every other value of . Let and use to show that:   If then ,    If then .       From the discussion in DIGRESSION: The Absolute Value Function we know that . Use the differentiation rules you learned in Part 1 of this text to show that if , then How does this compare with your calculations in part (a)?                                A slightly less intuitive example is the function . It is tempting to claim that this is really just since anything divided by itself is one but that claim is not true. As we saw in DIGRESSION: Dividing By Zero division by zero is undefined, regardless of the numerator. So the expression is undefined, and therefore the function is not defined at . It is also tempting to try to invoke L Hôpital s Rule, since it is true that But this only says that the limit of is equal to one, not that itself is equal to one, at . As we ve seen the statement explicitly excludes the point from consideration. This is why when we discussed indeterminate forms in Section we were very careful to write instead of . We needed to emphasize that we specifically do not allow the denominator to be equal to zero.     Use to show that if then is undefined.  It is pretty clear that is undefined, since is undefined. We can't have a derivative where we don't have a point. But this is the kind of vague reasoning we are trying to avoid. The purpose of this exercise is to show unequivocally that the limit which defines is undefined.    Use to show that if then is defined.  This time is defined but this is a silly way to do it. We do this for emphasis.                                   It is intuitively clear that derivative of the function (above) is not defined at . We will confirm our intuition using .  That is, we'll try to compute the derivative of at using and see what goes wrong. The existence of the derivative of at is equivalent to the existence of the limit , so we will try to compute this limit and see what happens.           Show that .    Show that .            shows, increases without bound as approaches zero from the right, and decreases without bound as approaches zero from the left. Since neither of these limits even exists it follows that also does not exist, and therefore is not defined\\aside{As a verbal shorthand most people will just say that the right- and left-hand limits are not equal and so does not exist. Be sure you understand why this is, strictly speaking, incorrect.}.   The Heaviside Function         shows that the derivative of the Absolute Value function (shown at the right) is: Notice that it is not defined at . We call the Heaviside function in honor of Oliver Heaviside (1850-1925). Simple as it is, Heaviside's function is a fundamental tool in signal processing, control theory, and the solution of differential equations.          Use to show that when     Explain why the result in part (a) does not contradict               We first introduced one-sided limits in Section . At the time our concern was to locate vertical asymptotes so we only looked at limits that were equal to either positive or negative infinity. We see now that these limits can take any value and that they are more fundamental than they first appeared to be. Since we didn't provide a formal definition earlier we will do so now.   One-sided Limits    If is a real number (or or ) and we say that is the right-hand limit of at . If is a real number (or or ) and we say that is the left-hand limit of at .    Because can't simultaneously approach two different numbers, if the left and right handed limits both exist but do not agree then doesn't exist. This fact will be a useful tool for us later so we state it as a theorem.   One Sided Derivatives  Theorem One Sided Derivatives    exists if and only if In that case all three limits are equal.    requires proof but we do not have the tools to prove it here. The appropriate tools will be developed in . Proving this fact is the last problem in this textbook.    One Sided Derivatives  Since limits may be right-hand or left-hand and the derivative is defined as a limit, it follows that derivatives can be right- or left-hand as well. We will denote the right-hand and left-hand derivatives at with the notation: and respectively:   One Sided Derivatives    Given a function, , defined at a point :    is said to have a right-hand derivative at if the limit exists.     is said to have a left-hand derivative at if the limit exists.       From and we see that the derivative of a function , at a point exists if and only if the right- and left-hand derivatives both exist, and are equal.    If , then is differentiable at and .   At zero both the right- and left-hand derivatives of the Absolute Value function exist since and but does not exist because .    Notice that since the Heaviside function at  , is not defined, neither are , , or .    Which of these derivatives would be defined if we were to arbitrarily define ? Explain.    Which of these derivatives would be defined if we were to arbitrarily define ? Explain.    Is there a value we could assign to so that is defined. Explain.   Review .                    Compute the right- and left-hand derivative, and the derivative itself, if they exist, of each of the following functions at the and . If any of these derivatives don't exist explain why not.                                      Use the limit definitions to compute the right- and left-hand derivative, of the function, , at , , and . At which of these points is differentiable?           Let be the Heaviside function and let be a real number.   Sketch .    Use to show that is not differentiable at .       Let also be a real number, distinct from , and define    Sketch .    Use to show that is not differentiable at or .                                             In we found that the possible transition points come in three flavors:   points where the derivative is zero,  points where the derivative is undefined, and,  if the function is defined on a closed interval, the endpoints of the interval.  We remarked at the time that it seemed odd that the third condition does not involve the derivative while the other two do.  With our new, deeper understanding of differentiation we can show that, in fact, there are really only two kinds of possible transition points, and both can be identified using the derivative. It turns out that the endpoints of a closed interval are not exceptional. They are really just points of non-differentiability.  To see this consider any function, which is continuous on the closed interval and differentiable on the open interval . From Corollary\\ we know that only exists if and both exist.   Comment  They also need to be equal, but that is irrelevant right now.   But the right-hand limit at doesn't exist. To see this, observe that is only defined on . Therefore when the expression asks us to evaluate at a point outside its domain, which is meaningless. Thus does not exist. A similar argument shows that does not exist.  Therefore does not exist at the endpoints of a closed interval. As a result the possible transition points of are only those places where the derivative is zero, or undefined, because the latter category includes the endpoints of closed intervals.   "

Henri Poincarè (1854-1912)   We began our treatment of limits in Chapter informally because it can take time to develop a mindset appropriate to a thorough understanding of limits. However, by proving theorems using properties of limits which we had not yet shown to be true we ve left a logical hole in the proofs of nearly every theorem, lemma, and corollary we ve stated. Bishop Berkeley would be most displeased.  It is time to fill those holes.  Loosely speaking, we know that if, as gets closer and closer to some real number , the function gets closer and closer to then . This phrase closer and closer is the source of the logical holes we need to fill.                    To illustrate what can go wrong with the intuitive approach to limits that we ve used so far, consider the limit , when To get a sense of what this function looks like when we let get closer and closer to we ve tabulated a few values of for near in the table at the right.                                                                                 Seems pretty convincing doesn t it? Can we conclude from this table that (Or maybe, that it is equal to 5?)  Sadly, no. In fact, since is continuous this limit is equal to zero because    Use your favorite computational tool to find a value of near such that .   The problem with our example is that none of the values in the first column is close enough to . Sure, the numbers and are very close together. But to evaluate this limit we don t just want to get close, we want to get close enough. For this particular function we d have to get much closer to before we start to see the values of getting close to .   Comment  It should be clear that we ve contrived this function so that we could make this point. It is unlikely that it is useful for any other purpose.   And that s the problem. The nature of the function we re taking the limit of must be taken into account when we decide what close enough means for any particular limit. This isn t as bad as it sounds, but as always precision is crucial. We need a definition of limit that doesn t depend on the nature of the function we re investigating. A useful definition will also recover the Differentiation Rules in a manner that even Bishop Berkeley would agree is valid.  We will begin with limits at infinity because, paradoxically, these are often the easiest to understand. As we proceed through examples the question you want to keep in the back of your mind is, For this problem how close is close enough?     Getting Around Infinity  It all comes down to understanding infinity, both the infinitely small and the infinitely large. Or rather, it comes down to realizing that we do not understand infinity at all. So, whenever an apparently infinite quantity appears we will have to work with and explain it in finite terms. This might sound impossible, but it turns out to be merely difficult.  This approach is within well established mathematical tradition. From the time of the ancient Greeks until the sixteenth century, infinity was carefully excluded from serious mathematical consideration. It was the successful exploitation of the infinitely small (infinitesimals) by Galileo and others that eventually forced mathematicians to study infinity seriously.  Today we tend to conceive of a straight line in infinite terms; as extending infinitely far in two opposite directions. But when Euclid wrote his geometry text The Elements , he very carefully avoided allowing the existence of an infinite line. For Euclid a straight line was what today would be called a line segment: the shortest path between two points.  But this restriction immediately caused problems for Euclid. For some of his constructions he needed to be able to extend his line segment. In modern mathematics this is not a problem since we allow lines to extend infinitely far in either direction. So we d just move to a new point on the line wherever it needs to be.             But when Euclid specified a line segment he meant that the points and were the endpoints of the line segment. To avoid infinite lines he extended the line segment by some definite amount out to a point , thereby obtaining a new segment , which and this is the point is still finite in length. In this way Euclid explicitly allowed line segments to be extendable to any finite length without ever allowing an infinitely long line.   The Infinitely Large  We want to ask, and answer, the question   What number does get close to if and we allow to grow infinitely large?   as precisely as we can without invoking the notion of the infinitely large. Does this rephrasing work for you?   If , what does get close to as grows larger and larger?   This seems to be better. We have side-stepped the issue of the infinitely large by saying larger and larger. But unfortunately this rephrasing of the question changes its meaning. To see what we mean, think of as the radius of a balloon which we want to inflate as much as we possibly can. Suppose we know that when the radius of the balloon is it will pop. To avoid popping our balloon, we blow in enough air during the first second to expand the radius to . In the next second we expand the radius to fill half of the remaining distance to . In the third we repeat the process, expanding it to . And we continue in this fashion. At each second the radius of our balloon expands to half of the remaining distance to .  Clearly the balloon s radius grows larger each second, so grows larger and larger as required. But the intent of our original question was for to become infinitely large, not for to remain smaller than .  And there is nothing special about . If moves half of the distance to each second, or halfway to , or even if it moves halfway to at each step we have the same problem. In each case is growing larger and larger but it is not growing in a manner that reflects what we think we mean when we say that is growing infinitely large.    Suppose is a positive real number, and that . Find a formula for as a function of time (in seconds), such that at each integer , the distance from to is half of the distance from to .   In this situation is said to be bounded above because there is an upper bound on how large can be, despite the fact that is growing larger and larger.   Recall that in we mentioned that the notation should be read aloud as increases without bound, so we rephrase our question as   If , what does get close to as increases without bound?     The Infinitely Small  The answer is very clear: gets closer and closer to zero. But of course, the phrase closer and closer is also too vague, and for essentially the same reason that larger and larger is too vague to be useful.        Again, it is not our conception of the problem that is the difficulty. It is the language we re using. As before, we must choose our words more carefully.  To capture the idea that gets closer and closer to zero, without ever getting to zero let s think this through, being careful to say exactly what we mean, no more, no less. To begin we ask, Is there a value of which forces to be less than, say   Keeping in mind that if then , if we need and that means that . Solving for we have .        So apparently any value of strictly greater than will guarantee that is less than .  Stop and think about that last sentence. Do you see that we ve actually discovered more than the original question asked for? Our question was, Is there a value of which forces to be less than ? But we ve actually found all of them. We ve found that if is any number greater than then regardless of which number we use.  Can we make Sure. Exactly the same analysis will show that if , then , or if , then , and so on.    If how large must be in order to guarantee that                                  It should be clear that we needn t have stopped at one millionth . The same argument will show that if we want we need And that if we want we need   So, by an appropriate choice of we can make as close to as we choose. To be a little more precise we say that we can make arbitrarily close to zero, even if it never actually is zero. And this is what we really intended when we said that gets closer and closer (or goes to ) zero.  This idea is exactly what the limit notation we introduced in was intended to capture. So here at last are our question and answer precisely stated:         Question:  If , what is ?    Answer:   ?       Convincing Berkeley  Is the use of these more precise terms enough to convince Bishop Berkeley?  Clearly not. If we were to show Berkeley that for we can guarantee that by taking , his response would simply be, So what? How do I know you can make less than . Nor will it be sufficient to show that we can make less than or any particular number. Berkeley will simply come back to us with a smaller challenge.             What we have to do is answer all possible challenges at once. This seems like a lot to ask until we think about it a bit. All we really have to do is suppose that we have some small, positive, unspecified number and show that we can find out how large has to be to make less than that number. For the sake of being definite we ll give our number a name. It is traditional to call it .   Mathematical Notation  Presumably for error since is the Greek version of the letter e.     Suppose that and we want to figure out how large to make to guarantee that If we want , first substitute for giving . Solve this for (remember that if then ) so that .  Do you see the significance of this? Because we left unspecified (other than requiring it to be positive), we ve met all possible challenges. If the challenge is to make less than our response is, We ve already done that. Just take . Repeating the computation above gives .  Now for some function , the statement has the following precise meaning:   If for each we can make by taking sufficiently large, then we say that the limit as approaches infinity is zero.    To be sure, when we allow to be arbitrary, but unspecified we skirt the edge of the infinitely small. But this is the point. If is arbitrary then it can be as small as we need for it to be without ever being infinitely small. This is akin to Euclid allowing lines to be extended to any, unspecified, length without allowing them to be infinite in length. This is the idea underlying limits and limit notation.   Mathematical Notation  Be careful. Unspecified does not mean variable. is a particular, fixed number. We just don t know which one it is.   Be aware that the meaning of the limit notation and the way we tend to speak about limits are inconsistent. This can present a lot of problems for the beginner. If we are speaking loosely, among friends, we would read this statement, , as: The limit of one over as goes to infinity is equal to zero. This is a very poor way to express the idea we are trying to capture. To say that  approaches infinity completely undercuts everything we ve said about infinity so far because it treats infinity as if it is an actual number.  We now understand that really means that as increases without bound, is getting arbitrarily close to zero but what we say is not what the notation means. That incongruity can be very confusing at first. In this text we will be very careful not to speak so casually. At least not until we have more experience with limits.  We have only begun, but this is enough for us to offer a first definition of the limit concept. We generalize slightly.   Positive Function With Limit Zero at Infinity    Suppose for all Then we say that if and only if for every we can find a real number with the property that if , then .    The parameter is the lower bound that has to exceed for to be less than . In our first example we had , in our last we had . Naming the lower bound like this gives us a concrete way to specify how large has to be. To great extent finding is the whole problem. This is easier to see in an example.   Show that if then As before take . (Think of epsilon as being handed to you by Bishop Berkeley. You don t get to control it, he does. Moreover all he will tell you about it is that it is a positive number.)  Once epsilon is given your job is to find out how large has to be to guarantee that So we work the problem backwards. That is, we start with and solve for to find that . If we take when then      Use to prove that for each of the functions below . That is, assume is given and find a lower bound such that if then .                                                   Refining the Definition   Definition works as long as , but without this restriction it fails utterly as our next example shows:   Suppose Can you guess the value of ? Let be given. Then when has any positive value, if we have and by we conclude that since all of the requirements of our definition have been met (except, of course, ). Of course, this is nonsense. As we have noted as increases without bound gets arbitrarily close to zero. So clearly . That we are able to prove that goes to zero simply means that doesn t capture everything we need. We need a more encompassing definition of a limit.   Based on our experience in Example with , what would you say needs to be changed in to allow as well?  The problem of course, is that if is given the statement doesn t really capture the idea that is near the number zero, only that it is less than the number . For example, is less than but it is nowhere near zero. What we need is a way to measure how far is from zero, regardless of whether in the positive or the negative direction.  That is exactly what the absolute value function measures. For example, both and are the same distance from zero, the first one in the positive and the second one in the negative direction. That is .  We need to modify our definition so that the distance from to zero is less than . We want not just .   Zero Limit at Infinity    Suppose is defined for all . Then we say that if and only if for every we can find a real number with the property that whenever       First:  Suppose . We want to prove rigorously that .    Let be given.  As we did in we find the bound by working the problem backwards. We want to end with , so that s where we start.  Since we are only interested in what happens to as , we can safely assume that . In that case if then it follows that     and if then ,      so apparently to make we need . So we take .   END OF SCRAPWORK           Let be given. Take . If then Therefore and So Therefore, by  .      This example displays the format of a limit proof that you need to adhere to. Below is an outline of the format. Do not depart from this format. This is not a course in creative writing.   First:  State the challenge, .    Second:  Specify the bound (usually in terms of ).    Third:  Show that if then .    Fourth:  State your conclusion.      Identify which statements in the proof in correspond to the first, second, third, and fourth parts of the format presented above.    Our previous examples and problems in this section were fairly simple as formal limit problems go. This one is more complex.  Use to show that .    For a given , we want to end up with Part of what makes this limit more complex is that the part inside the absolute value , is not always positive. We need to deal with that somehow.  First, since we are only concerned about what happens as it is safe to assume that . In that case, . Next, observe that if also, then . Thus , so that . We could now work backwards like before, and solve for . This will work fine, but the Algebra gets very messy. Try it and see.  There is a sneaky way to do this that avoids some of the Algebra. Notice that . Notice further that if , then so that . Putting all of this together we we that for ,   Thus to guarantee that we need , or .   END OF SCRAPWORK     Let be given. Let be the larger of and . If then so . Therefore Since , we see that . Thus Therefore by ,         Explain carefully, and in detail, the reasoning that supports the claims made in Equations and .    Notice that in and that the scrapwork was an essential part of the solution, but in the formal proof the results of the scrapwork were so abbreviated as to almost not be present. This is part of the formalism of mathematical writing. We try to make sure that everything that needs to be said is said and absolutely nothing more. In this instance in particular, we are not obligated to explain where the bound came from, only that it works. It can take time to become comfortable with this presentation style.  Even with practice very few people can read a formal proof without doing the computations necessary to show that all of the claims made are actually true. Keep paper and pencil handy at all times to help you follow the argument.    For each of the following show that .                                            .}                  Definition only tells us what it means when the limit of some function as is zero. But as we observed in Example as increases without bound approaches , not . We ll need something more general, but all of the important ideas have been introduced. We generalize as follows.   A Limit at    Suppose that is a real number and that is defined for all . Then we say that if and only if for every there is a real number with the property that whenever      Notice that if this reduces to .   Suppose . Intuitively, it is clear that but we need to prove that this is so.    Suppose is given. We need to specify a number (probably in terms of ), with the property that if then So we will work backwards from this inequality.   Thus , and it appears that as long as is greater than    END OF SCRAPWORK     Let be given. Take . Then Therefore by ,         In we approached the problem of finding a horizontal asymptote of in the following highly intuitive manner, using the notation. So we see that this limit must be equal to five. To prove this rigorously, without referring to infinity, we use     Let be given. As before we work backwards from our goal, . As long as this is the same as so we will stipulate that (and therefore ) must be at least greater than . Solving equation for we see that also. So we take to be the greater of and . We capture this idea with the notation, .   END OF SCRAPWORK          Show that we really only need the condition by showing that implies that .    Suppose that and . Prove that if then                                     We want to give a rigorous proof that . Let be given.    Do the scrapwork that shows that we must take .    Show that if then                    Do the scrapwork, and provide a rigorous proof of each of the limits below.                             It should be clear how to define a limit at . All of the same issues of clarity and precision that we encountered before come up here as well. The only difference is that we have to change the sense of our inequalities to reflect that is decreasing without bound.   A Limit at    Suppose is defined for all Then we say that if and only if for every we can find a real number with the property that whenever        Do the scrapwork, and provide a rigorous proof of each of the limits below.                                Limits at a Real Number  In the previous section we were focused on the relatively simple limits associated with horizontal asymptotes. But our goal is to use the limit in to prove that the Differentiation Rules we ve been using are valid. To do that we will use the following precise, rigorous definition of a limit as where is some real number.   The Limit at a Point    Suppose is a function, and that is a real number. We say that if and only if for every there is a with the property that whenever , .    Take particular notice of the fact that neither Definition nor tells us how to compute the limit. They serve only to rigorously establish what our intuition says the limit should be.         DIGRESSION: The Absolute Value, again  Digression Absolute Value, again    It can be difficult to work with the absolute value inside of inequalities. To avoid these kinds of problems it is useful to remember that Although the second version looks slightly more complicated, it has the advantage that there are no absolute value symbols to trip us up.   END OF DIGRESSION   Notice the similarities and the differences between , , and .  We use the same way we used Definition : We take as a challenge and find conditions which guarantee that . Previously we were interested in the behavior of  close to infinity so the condition was that (that was large enough, loosely speaking). Now we are interested in the behavior of  close to so we need to indicate how close has to be to . The in plays the same role that the upper bound played in and . It locates where must be in order to guarantee that .             The sketch below depicts the situation when visually. We have indicated that is not defined at , but it could be. Limits don t care what happens at , only what happens near . To emphasize this point we will usually say that , rather than . Because the inequality on the left is strict, we do not consider what happens when .   Comment  The graph of appears to be a straight line because we are zoomed in very close to the point and the Principle of Local Linearity is in play.    As before is the challenge. To show that the limit exists and is equal to as claimed our task is to find a value of such that, as long  as is between the corresponding      will be between and .  More succinctly, we need to find such that if then .  Visually, this means that the graph of will be between the dashed horizontal lines as long as is between the dotted vertical lines.   is the culmination of approximately years of attempts by some very brilliant people to provide a rigorous foundation for Calculus. Don t expect to absorb this easily. It will take time and effort to fully understand and be able to use it. We will start simply.    Use , , , and to explain that the following are obviously true.   We are not looking for a formal proof, just a reasonable explanation.    Observe that it is intuitively clear that if then . We wish to prove this rigorously.    Suppose is given. Our goal is to find a such that if (or just ) then . Solving this for we have Recall from that , so we see that or, equivalently   It appears that as long as , so we take .   END OF SCRAPWORK    This was the scrapwork. The proof consists of showing that the condition we found, , actually works.   Let be given. Take .  Assume that . Then Therefore .      Notice that our proof does not give us any new information since it is intuitively clear that . The formalism of a limit merely confirms, in a manner even Bishop Berkeley would accept, what we already know to be true.  Incidentally, since we have also just proved that is continuous at . See .  For simple problems like this one the proof consisted of writing the algebraic steps from our Scrapwork backwards, as you see. This worked because every algebraic step in the Scrapwork was reversible. But don t jump to conclusions. This will not always be the case.  Clearly the Scrapwork is the most important part of the solution process for this problem. In a very real sense it actually is the solution. We call it Scrapwork because it is the part of the work that you don t show anyone else because it is messy and not well organized\\aside{We kept it clean and orderly here so you could see the reasoning.}. The scrapwork is like the scaffolding used to construct a building. The proof is the building.  It is absolutely necessary to have the scaffolding while construction is ongoing but you tear it down and clean everything up before you move in. In the same way your proof should be a cleaned up version of your scrapwork. If this example were a homework problem, your solution would be the part that appears between Proof and the little black square, , at the end.   Historical Background  When Latin was the language of scholarship a mathematical proof ended with the letters Q.E.D. , which are the initials of the phrase quod erat demonstrandum , meaning which was to be demonstrated. Contrary to a popular joke it does not mean Quite Easily Done. In the late twentieth century this traditional ending began to be replaced by the black square we re using (or some variation of it). It is called a Halmos in honor of Paul Halmos , a preeminent mathematician of the th century, who popularized it.     Returning from recall that we had We had shown by an intuitive argument that . Our previous proof lacked rigor, especially in the last step. We will provide a fully rigorous proof now.    Let be given and take . Then if we have Observe that since . Therefore and so Therefore       Notice that it is again irrelevant that .    Use the proof above to recreate the scrapwork that we did before we wrote the proof.     4   We would like to find the value of , and prove that the value we find is correct.  Remember that none of our limit definitions tell us how to find the value of a limit, only how to prove that it has a particular value after we ve found it. In our examples so far the value of the limits have been intuitively clear so we haven t concerned ourselves with this part of the problem. But before we can prove that a limit has a particular value we obviously need to decide what we believe the limit value is.  We have several options for doing this. The simplest is guessing, but guessing works best if we have some intuition about the problem. Guessing blindly is usually a waste of time. Nevertheless, guessing is always an option. Can you guess the value of this limit?  Another simple option is to use a calculator and plug the value of the limit point, in this case , and see what the calculator comes up with. This will work if the function is continuous at the limit point. But is not continuous at so that won t help with this problem. Try it and see.         A third, and much more useful option is to sketch the graph of to see what is close to near the limit point. The graph of is given at the right. It is not defined at because when we get zero in the denominator. Nevertheless the limit at seems to exist. As you can see as approaches , appears to approach . Based on this graph it seems likely that the value of the limit is .  As we saw in , Algebra can also be very helpful. In this case we see that where the cancellation in red is only valid when . Our limit point is so it is not under consideration.  In fact, once we have rigorously proved , and from (We will do this in ) the following will be a valid proof:      Identify where we used , , and in the development above.    Because we haven t yet rigorously proved , , or we can t use them to construct a rigorous proof. Until they are proved they are not known, they are just believed. Belief is not knowledge.  But there is no problem with using them to gather evidence. So far we have strong evidence that this limit is .  Having gathered our evidence, we now believe that . Next we need to do the scrapwork for our proof.   As always we work backwards from our goal. We need to show that so Since we re not interested in the value of anything at (where the denominator is zero) we can factor and cancel, giving We see that if then or So taking will work for this problem.   END OF SCRAPWORK     Let be given. Take . Then if we have Since we see that and so Therefore .      A long list of inequalities like those in can be a little intimidating. Don t let that stop you. Verify each transition from one inequality to the next. If you don t see why a particular transition is valid refer back to the scrapwork.   DIGRESSION: Why We Prove Theorems  Digression Why We Prove Theorems    The proof of any theorem will follow logically from the relevant definitions, lemmas, corollaries, and previously proved theorems. However, as we ve seen proving that from was very delicate and troublesome, and it only gave us one relatively insignificant limit. We d really like to work more generally than this if we can.  We prove general theorems so that we can use them as tools. Do we have any tools (theorems) that would have made the proof of simpler?        Show that satisfies all of the conditions of .    Use  to prove that .    Is your proof in part (b) rigorous? Why or why not?             L Hôpital s Rule is a very powerful tool which simultaneously evaluates a limit and provides a rigorous proof of the result. And it is much easier to use than .  But sadly, it will be of no use to us for the remainder of this chapter. L Hôpital s Rule relies on knowing that our differentiation rules are valid, and we don t know that yet. That the differentiation rules are valid is exactly what we are trying to show. To use L Hôpital s Rule would be to engage in circular reasoning, which is invalid.   END OF DIGRESSION    In this example we will show rigorously that the derivative of is . To do that we need to show that Recall that differentiation is a local property so we are thinking of as a fixed, but unspecified real number. The variable in this example is .    For we need to find such that if , then . Working backwards from this we have so we choose .   END OF SCRAPWORK      Use the scrapwork above to write down a rigorous proof that if then .      Limit Laws (Theorems)   If we can prove each of the limit laws in Chapter rigorously (i.e, using ) we will have provided a rigorous foundation for Differential Calculus. We will address these now.  To prove the limit laws we will need to make extensive use of what is called the Triangle Inequality . We state and prove the Triangle Inequality here so that we can cite it as needed.   The Triangle Inequality  Theorem Triangle Inequality   For any real numbers , and , .   The proof of the Triangle Inequality relies on equation from Digression: Absolute Value, again .   Proof of the Triangle Inequality  Clearly and Adding these together we have so by we have .      The Limit Laws we need to prove are:   Theorem :  The Limit of a Constant is the Constant.     Theorem :  The Limit of a Sum is the Sum of the Limits    Theorem :  The Limit of a Product is the Product of the Limits    Theorem :  The Limit of a Composition is the Composition of the Limits, and    Theorem :  The Squeeze Theorem     We will provide a proof of the limit at infinity version of each of these Theorems using . We will leave the proof of the limit at a real number version using the as an exercise for you. In every case you can model your scrapwork and proof on the ones we provide.   The Limit at Infinity of a Constant Function is the Constant  Theorem Limit at Infinity of a Constant Function is the Constant  Suppose and are real numbers. If for all then .    Let be given. Take Then if we see that Therefore       The formalism we re using requires that we specify some value for . It was convenient to specify , but in this proof any value for would have worked as well.   The Limit at Negative Infinity of a Constant Function is the Constant  Theorem Limit at Negative Infinity of a Constant Function is the Constant  Suppose and are real numbers. If for all then      Use the proof of Theorem as a model to construct a proof of .

If near then      Use the proof of Theorem as a model to construct a proof of .    Despite the apparent simplicity of this problem there is a lot going on here. Recall that near means that on some open interval, say , containing except possibly at (see Definition ). You need to find a such that if then . That is, you need an interval of length with as the midpoint where . But there is no guarantee that is the midpoint of the interval . This would be an excellent time to engage your visual intuition by drawing a sketch so you can see the problem.      The Limit of a Sum   The Limit of a Sum at Infinity  Theorem Limit of a Sum at Infinity   If and then     As always we begin by assuming that has been given.  We want to show that if is large enough (larger than some specified ) then The only information we have to work with is the knowledge that which means that we can make and as close to zero as we wish, provided we make large enough. Rewriting the left-hand side of Equation and invoking the Triangle Inequality we see that But as we ve observed we can make and as close to zero as we wish, provided we take large enough. To be precise, there is a number such that if then . Similarly there is a number such that if then .  Since we need for both of these things to happen a sufficiently large value of is one where and .   END OF SCRAPWORK     Let be given. Since there is a bound, such that if then Since there is a bound, such that if then Take . Then if then and . Thus by the Triangle Inequality ( ) Therefore         Use the proof of Theorem as a model to construct a proof of below.

The Limit of a Composition  Recall that at the end of in we commented that it is only true that is equal to when is continuous at .  The following example demonstrates why we need for to be continuous at .   Let and . Observe that when , that , and that is not continuous at . We have and . Therefore     The Limit of a Composition at Infinity  Theorem Limit of a Composition at Infinity   Suppose and is continuous at . Then                It will be helpful to have a visual guide for this proof so we will rely on diagrams here in the scrapwork. Our finalized proof below will not.  Let be given. We need to show that we can find a such that if then .  Since is continuous at  tells us that   Thus tells us that there there is a real number such that if then , as visualized in the sketch at the right.  Next, consider what it means to say that . It means that if we take large enough we can make as close to as we would like. In particular, we would like for as in the sketch below.    Therefore, we can find a number such that for every , . If we take , then we have .  From the continuity of at we know that means that    END OF SCRAPWORK     Let be given. Since is continuous at there is a real number such that Since there is a real number such that Take be the lower bound needed to guarantee that .

We state these lemmas here so that we can refer to them in the proof of Theorem but the proof of is not complete until these lemmas have been proved.   If and then     If and then     Proof of  Let be given. Observe that Adding and subtracting the same term like this is a highly non-intuitive, but common trick. Most mathematicians call it adding zero since middle terms add to zero. We (the authors) call this uncanceling because the middle terms cancel. It is hard to tell a priori when this trick will work. Sometimes you just have to try something and see what happens.  In this case our uncanceling allows us to use the Triangle Inequality effectively. From the Triangle Inequality we see that By there is a real number such that if then By there is a real number such that if then Take . If then Therefore .         Proving  To prove we need to guarantee that if is large enough then where is an arbitrary, positive, real number. An obvious strategy is to observe that since we know that it must be that if is large enough then .  But that strategy will fail. Here s why. says that if then for any single real number we can find a such that if then But is not a single real number. For each distinct value of we ll have a (possibly) different value of . We have no definition, and no theorem that says we can do this. So we can t. That strategy won t work. At least it won t work in its most obvious form.  But it will work if we can replace by some fixed value. The following lemma states that since has a finite limit, it must be bounded. This will allow us to replace with that bound, which is a fixed parameter, in our proof of .   If then there are positive real numbers and , such that if , then .    Since there is a positive number such that if then . So for , Now choose any positive number with and it follows that if then .       Draw a convincing diagram of and its proof.    Proof of  From we see that there are positive real numbers and , such that for all  Let be given. Since there is a real number such that for all  Take . Then for all we have Therefore           Proving  To prove we need to guarantee that if is large enough then where is an arbitrary real number. This is very similar to our goal in proving . But this time the obvious strategy will work. Almost.  That is, as long as we can guarantee that by taking large enough to guarantee that .  We will need to handle the case separately.   Proof of  Let be given.  There are two cases.   Case 1:     Because there is a real number such that if then   So if then .  Therefore when .   (Case 1)     Case 2:     In this case .  Therefore when .   Case 2    Since the limit is zero in both cases we see that .      Having completed the proofs of and our proof of is now also complete.  The proofs of these two lemmas was not for the faint of heart. None of the individual pieces was difficult to follow, but putting them all together in the right order was delicate.  On the other hand, once and are known the proof of becomes even simpler as the next drill shows.    As you ve seen using the limit definition (using and ) to prove theorems is hard. But, as we said in DIGRESSION: Why We Prove Theorems , the whole point of proving theorems is to give ourselves more refined tools that we can use instead of resorting to definitions.    Now that we have and there is actually a simpler way to prove . Observe that and complete the proof by citing and and the appropriate, previously proven, limit theorem.   The right side of equation is a sum.     can also be proved without resorting to the limit definition (using and ). Prove it by citing and the appropriate, previously proved, limit theorems.                                 If you find yourself becoming completely absorbed in, and possibly even enjoying the details of these arguments you are surely a mathematician by inclination, if not by training (yet). There are more, and more interesting, results where these came from. Change your major and come join us. Sometimes we bring cookies.    Use our proof of Theorem as a model to prove Theorem below.     The Limit of a Product at Negative Infinity  Theorem Limit of a Product at Negative Infinity  If then      Use our proof of Theorem as a model to prove Theorem below.     Limit of a Product at a Point  Theorem Limit of a Product at a Point  Suppose that and for some real number . Then    Finally, we come to the limit of a quotient. Given how much trouble the limit of a product gave us, it is a little scary to think about proving that the limit of a quotient is the quotient of limits from the definition.  This trepidation is justified. It is very tricky to prove --- from the definition --- that the limit of a quotient is what we expect it to be. Fortunately we won t have to. We now have enough theorems (tools) available that we no longer have to work directly from the limit definition.  However we will need to dispose of the following small detail.      The Function is Continuous Wherever It Is Defined   The function is continuous at .   You will need Lemma to solve Problem below. We will provide the scrapwork and leave the formal proof as a problem for you.   To keep things simple (this is scrapwork, after all) we will first assume that . If we have an then by Theorem we need to find a such that if then . As usual we work backwards.  Combining the fractions we see that so we need to find a such that ensures that .  At first it appears that all we need to do choose . If we could do that we d have in which case   But of course we ve seen this before. Just as in the proof of Lemma , must be a constant; it cannot depend on . So we need to replace with a constant somehow. The Algebra here gets a bit delicate. We strongly recommend that you visualize each step of the following argument with a sketch like the one we used in the scrapwork for Theorem   Suppose that Then we see that or Thus if we make , we see that and so, from the right side of equation . for all .   Comment  Notice that we are using the left side of equation    Therefore . Thus if we choose to be the lesser of and we have everything we need to conclude that for    END OF SCRAPWORK          Use the scrapwork above to show that if then .    If we could replicate the proof in part (a), but keeping track of all of the sign changes will be burdensome. Otherwise it is really the same proof. Instead, notice that if then and so by part (a) Use this observation to prove that if then .   Let .                     Armed with this and our Limit Theorems, we can tackle the proof of the next theorem without resorting back to definitions.   The Limit of a Quotient is the Quotient of the Limits  Theorem Limit of a Quotient is the Quotient of the Limits  Suppose is positive infinity, negative infinity, or some real number, that , and that . Then          Prove that if and then    Rewrite as . Which of our theorems can you apply?    Prove that if and then     Prove that if is some real number, and , and . Then                             We have one last loose end to tie up. Recall that in Chapter says that a limit exists if and only if the right- and left-hand limits both exist and are equal. One-sided limits are informally defined in . But an informal definition is not sufficiently precise to support constructing a proof, so here is the formal Definition of a right-hand limit.   Right-Hand Limit    Suppose is defined on some interval . Let be a real number. We say that provided that for each , there is a with such that if , then .          Use as a model to state a similar definition for     Prove from .             As you can see, rigorous demonstrations, as necessary as they are, can become complicated and tedious. Perhaps this explains why the practice of Calculus predated its theory.  We have defined the derivative by Definition , derived all of our differentiation rules via this definition, and shown rigorously that founding Calculus on the theory of limits gives us all of the properties we found useful in of this textbook. At long last, this places a solid, logical, and rigorous foundation underneath the Differential Calculus of Newton and Leibniz.  And Bishop Berkeley has nothing left to criticize.    "

Remember that none of our limit definitions tell us how to find the value of a limit, only how to prove that it has a particular value after we ve found it. In our examples so far the value of the limits have been intuitively clear so we haven t concerned ourselves with this part of the problem. But before we can prove that a limit has a particular value we obviously need to decide what we believe the limit value is.  We have several options for doing this. The simplest is guessing, but guessing works best if we have some intuition about the problem. Guessing blindly is usually a waste of time. Nevertheless, guessing is always an option. Can you guess the value of this limit?  Another simple option is to use a calculator and plug the value of the limit point, in this case , and see what the calculator comes up with. This will work if the function is continuous at the limit point. But is not continuous at so that won t help with this problem. Try it and see.         A third, and much more useful option is to sketch the graph of to see what is close to near the limit point. The graph of is given at the right. It is not defined at because when we get zero in the denominator. Nevertheless the limit at seems to exist. As you can see as approaches , appears to approach . Based on this graph it seems likely that the value of the limit is .  As we saw in , Algebra can also be very helpful. In this case we see that where the cancellation in red is only valid when .
