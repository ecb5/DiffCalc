<p>
. . . in becoming rigorous, mathematical science takes a
  character so artificial as to strike everyone; it forgets its
  historical origins; we see how the questions can be answered, we no
  longer see how and why they are
  put.

<p>

We began our treatment of limits in <xref ref="CHAPTERlimits-lhop-rule">Chapter</xref>
informally because it can take time to develop a mindset appropriate
to a thorough understanding of limits. However, by proving theorems
using properties of limits which we have not yet shown to be true
we<rsq/>ve left a logical hole in the proofs of nearly every theorem,
lemma, and corollary we<rsq/>ve stated. Bishop Berkeley would be most
displeased.
</p>
<p>

It is time to fill those holes.
</p>
<p>

Loosely speaking, we know that if, as <m>x</m> gets <q>closer and closer</q>
to some real number <m>a</m>, the function <m>f(x)</m> gets <q>closer and closer</q>
to <m>A</m> then <m>\tlimit{x}{a}{f(x)}=A</m>.  This phrase <q>closer and
closer</q>  is the source of the logical holes we need to fill.

To illustrate what can go wrong with the intuitive approach to limits that
we<rsq/>ve used so far, consider the limit <m>\limit{x}{1}{f(x)}</m>, when
<me>f(x) =\frac1\pi\inverse\tan(10^8(x-1)).</me>
To get a sense of what this function looks like when we let
<m>x</m> get <q>closer and closer</q> to <m>1</m> we've tabulated a few values of <m>f(x)</m> for
<m>x</m> near <m>1</m> in the table at the right.

Seems pretty convincing doesn<rsq/>t it? Can we conclude from this table
that
<me>
\limit{x}{1}{\frac1\pi\inverse\tan(10^8(x-1))} = 4.999?
</me>
(Or   maybe, that it is equal to 5?)
</p>

<p>
Sadly, no. In fact, since <m>f(x)</m> is
continuous  this limit is equal to zero because
<me>
f(1) =
 \frac1\pi\inverse\tan(10^8(1-1))% =\frac1\pi\inverse\tan(10^8(0))
 =\frac1\pi\inverse\tan(0)=0.

<exercise>
<statement>
<p>
Use your favorite computational tool to find a value of <m>x</m> near <m>1</m> such that
<m>\abs{f(x)}\lt10^{-3}</m>.
        </p>
</statement>
</exercise>
<p>

The problem with our example is that none of the <m>x</m> values in the
first column is close enough to <m>1</m>.  Sure, the numbers <m>1</m> and
<m>1.0001</m> are very close together. But to evaluate this limit we don<rsq/>t
just want to get close, we want to get close enough.  For this
particular function we<rsq/>d have to get much closer to <m>1</m>
before we start to see the values of <m>f(x)</m> getting close to <m>0</m>.
</p>


<aside>
<title>Comment</title>

<p>
It should be clear that we<rsq/>ve contrived this
  function so that we could make this point. It is unlikely that it is
  useful for any other purpose.
</p>
</aside>


<p>

And that<rsq/>s the problem. The nature of the function we're taking the
limit of must be taken into account when we decide what <q>close
enough</q> means for any particular limit.  This isn<rsq/>t as bad as it
sounds, but as always precision is crucial. We need a definition of
<term>limit</term> that doesn<rsq/>t depend on the nature of the function we're
investigating. A useful definition will also recover the
Differentiation Rules in a manner that even Bishop Berkeley would
agree is valid.
</p>
<p>

We will begin with limits <q>at infinity</q> because, paradoxically,
these are often the easiest to understand. As we proceed through
examples the question you want to keep in the back of your mind is,
<q>For this problem how close is close enough?</q>
</p>

<section xml:id="SECTIONlimits-at-infinity">
<title>Getting Around Infinity</title>
<p>
It all comes down to understanding infinity, both the infinitely small
and the infinitely large. Or rather, it comes down to realizing that
we do not understand infinity at all. So, whenever an apparently
<q>infinite quantity</q> appears we will have to work with and explain it
in finite terms. This might sound impossible, but it turns out to be
merely difficult.
</p>
<p>

This approach is within well established mathematical tradition. From
the time of the ancient Greeks until the sixteenth century, infinity
was carefully excluded from serious mathematical consideration. It was
the successful exploitation of the infinitely small (infinitesimals) by
Galileo and others that eventually forced mathematicians to study
infinity seriously.
</p>
<p>

  Today we tend to conceive of a straight line in
  infinite terms; as extending infinitely far in two opposite
  directions. But
  when
  <url href="https://mathshistory.st-andrews.ac.uk/Biographies/Euclid/" visual="https://mathshistory.st-andrews.ac.uk/Biographies/Euclid/">Euclid</url>
  wrote his geometry
  text
  <url href="https://www.maa.org/press/periodicals/convergence/mathematical-treasure-euclid-proposition-on-papyrus" visual="https://www.maa.org/press/periodicals/convergence/mathematical-treasure-euclid-proposition-on-papyrus"><pubtitle>The
      Elements</pubtitle></url>, he very carefully avoided allowing the existence of
  an <q>infinite line.</q>  For Euclid a straight line was what today
  would be 
  called a line segment: the shortest path between two points.
</p>
<p>

  But this restriction immediately caused problems for Euclid. For
  some of his constructions he needed to be able to extend his line
  segment. In modern mathematics this is not a problem since we allow
  lines to extend infinitely far in either direction. So we<rsq/>d just
  move to a new point on the line wherever it needs to be.
</p>

<!-- \end{wrapfigure} -->
<p>
But when Euclid specified a line segment <m>\overline{AB}</m> he meant that
the points <m>A</m> and <m>B</m> were the endpoints of the line segment. 
To avoid infinite lines he  extended the line segment <m>\overline{AB}</m>
by some definite amount 
out to a point <m>C</m>, thereby obtaining a new segment
<m>\overline{AC}</m>, which <mdash/> and this is the point <mdash/> is still
finite in length. 
In this way Euclid explicitly allowed line segments to be extendable to any
finite length
without ever allowing an infinitely long line.

<paragraphs xml:id="SUBSECTIONEpsDelt1">
<title>The Infinitely Large</title>
<p>
  We want to ask, and answer, the question
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
 What number does <m>y</m> get close to if <m>y=\frac1x</m> and
 we allow <m>x</m> to grow infinitely large?
</p> 
</blockquote>
<p>
 as precisely as we can
  without invoking the notion of the infinitely large.
  Does this rephrasing  work for you?
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
      If <m>y=\frac1x</m>, what does <m>y</m> get close to as <m>x</m> grows
        larger and larger?
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
  This seems to be better. We have side-stepped the issue of the
  infinitely large by saying <q>larger and larger.</q> But unfortunately
  this rephrasing of the question changes its meaning.  To see what we
  mean, think of <m>x</m> as the radius of a balloon which we want to
  inflate as much as we possibly can. Suppose we know that when the
  radius of the balloon is <m>8</m> it will pop. To avoid popping our
  balloon, we blow in enough air during the first second to expand the
  radius to <m>x(1)=4</m>. In the next second we expand the radius to fill
  half of the remaining distance to <m>x(2)=6</m>.  In the third we repeat
  the process, expanding it to <m>x(3)=7</m>. And we continue in this
  fashion. At each second the radius of our balloon expands to half of
  the remaining distance to <m>8</m>.
</p>
<p>

Clearly the balloon<rsq/>s radius grows larger each second, so <m>x</m> grows
<q>larger and larger</q> as required. But the intent of our original
question was for <m>x</m> to become <q>infinitely large,</q> not for <m>x</m> to
remain smaller than <m>8</m>.
</p>
<p>

And there is nothing special about <m>8</m>. If <m>x</m> moves half of the
distance to <m>16</m> each second, or halfway to <m>32</m>, or even if it moves
halfway to <m>1,048,576</m> at each step we have the same problem.  In each
case <m>x</m> is growing <q>larger and larger</q> but it is not growing in a
manner that reflects what we think we mean when we say that <m>x</m> is
growing <q>infinitely large.</q>
</p>

<exercise xml:id="DRILLBoundedGrowth">
<statement>
<p>
  Suppose <m>B</m> is a positive real number, and that <m>x(0)=0</m>. Find a
  formula for <m>x</m> as a function of time <m>t</m> (in seconds), such that at
  each integer <m>t>0</m>, the distance from <m>x(t)</m> to <m>B</m> is half of the distance
  from <m>x(t-1)</m> to <m>B</m>.
</p>
</statement>
</exercise>
<p>

In this situation <m>x</m> is said to be \term{bounded above} because there
is an upper bound on how large <m>x</m> can be, despite the fact that <m>x</m>
is growing <q>larger and larger.</q>
</p>
<p>

Recall that in <xref ref="SECTIONhoriz-asympt-as"></xref> we mentioned that
the notation <m>x\rightarrow\infty</m> should be read aloud as <q><m>x</m>
increases without bound,</q> so we rephrase our question as
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>      If <m>y=\frac1x</m>, what does <m>y</m> get close to as <m>x</m> increases
      without bound?
</p>
</blockquote>
</paragraphs>


<paragraphs  xml:id="SUBSECTIONFormalLimits">
<title>The Infinitely Small</title>

<p>


The answer is very clear: <m>y</m> gets closer and closer to zero.  But of
course, the phrase <q>closer and closer</q> is also too vague, and for
essentially the same reason that <q>larger and larger</q> is too vague to
be useful.
</p>
<p>

Consider our balloon example again. If the radius, <m>x</m>, is constantly
increasing but it is bounded above by <m>8</m> then <m>x</m> is certainly
getting <q>closer and closer</q> to <m>8</m>. But it<rsq/>s also getting <q>closer
and closer</q> to <m>9</m>. And <m>10</m>. And any other number greater than <m>8</m>.
</p>
<p>


Again, it is not our conception of the problem that is the
difficulty. It is the language we<rsq/>re using. As before, we must choose
our words more carefully.
</p>
<p>

To capture the idea that <m>y=\frac1x</m> gets <q>closer and
closer</q> to zero,
without ever getting to zero  let<rsq/>s think this through, being careful
to say exactly what we mean, no more, no less.
To begin we ask, <q>Is there a value of <m>x</m> which forces <m>y</m> to be less
than, say <m>1/2?</m></q>
</p>
<p>


Keeping in mind that if <m>a\lt b</m> then <m>\frac1a\gt\frac1b</m>, if we need
<m>y\lt 1/2</m> and  <m>y=1/x</m> that means that
<m> 1/x\lt 1/2</m>. Solving for <m>x</m>  we have <m> x\gt 2</m>.
</p>

<image source="images/Epsilon1.png" width="50%"/>
<!-- \begin{wrapfigure}[]{r}{2.8in} -->
<!--   \captionsetup{labelformat=empty} -->
<!--   \centerline{\includegraphics*[height=1.7in,width=2.8in]{../Figures/Epsilon1}} -->
<!--   \label{fig:Epsilon1} -->
<!-- \end{wrapfigure} -->
<p>

So apparently any value of <m>x</m> strictly greater than <m>2</m> will
guarantee that <m>y</m> is less than <m>1/2</m>.
</p>
<p>

Stop and think about that last sentence. Do you see that we<rsq/>ve
actually discovered more than the original question asked for? Our
question was, <q>Is there a value of <m>x</m> which forces <m>y</m> to be less
than <m>1/2</m>?</q> But we<rsq/>ve actually found all of them. We've found
that if <m>x</m> is any number greater than <m>2</m> then
<m>y=\frac1x\lt \frac12,</m> regardless of which number we use.
</p>
<p>

Can we make <m>y\lt 1/3?</m> Sure. Exactly the same analysis will show
that if <m>x\gt 3</m>, then <m>y=\frac1x\lt \frac13</m>, or if <m>x\gt 4</m>, then
<m>y\lt 1/4</m>, and so on.

<p>

It should be clear that we needn<rsq/>t have stopped at one millionth
(<m>10^{-6}</m>). The same argument will show that if we want
<m>y=\frac1x\lt 10^{-10},</m> we need <m>x\gt 10^{10}.</m> And that if we want
<m>y=\frac1x\lt 10^{-1000},</m> we need <m>x\gt 10^{1000}.</m>
</p>
<p>

So, by an appropriate choice of <m>x</m> we can make <m>y=\frac1x</m> as close
to <m>0</m> as we choose. To be a little more precise we say that  we can make <m>y</m> arbitrarily close
  to zero, even if it never actually is zero. And this is
what we really intended when we said that <m>y</m> gets <q>closer and closer</q>
(or <q>goes to</q>) zero.

<title>Convincing Berkeley</title>

<p>

Is the use of these more precise terms enough to convince Bishop
Berkeley?
</p>
<p>

Clearly not. If we were to show Berkeley that for <m>y=\frac1x</m> we can guarantee
that <m>y\lt 1/2</m> by taking <m>x\gt 2</m>, his response would simply be,
<q>So what? How do I know you can make <m>y</m> less than <m>1/3</m>.</q> Nor will
it be sufficient to show that we can make less than
<m>1/3, 1/4, 1/10000</m> or any particular number. Berkeley will simply
come back to us with a  smaller challenge.

<p>

What we have to do is answer all possible challenges at once. This
seems like a lot to ask until we think about it a bit. All we really
have to do is suppose that we have some small, positive,
unspecified number and show that we can find out how large <m>x</m>
has to be to make <m>y=\frac1x</m> less than that number. For the sake of
being definite we<rsq/>ll give our number a name. It is traditional to call
it <m>\eps</m>.
</p>

<title>Mathematical Nomenclature</title>
<p>
Presumably for <q>error</q> since <m>\eps</m> is the Greek version of
the letter <q>e.</q>
</p>
</aside>


<image source="images/Epsilon2.png" width="50%"/>
<p>

Suppose that <m>\eps\gt 0</m> and we want to figure out how large to make
<m>x</m> to guarantee that <m>y=\frac1x\lt \eps.</m> If we want <m>y\lt \eps</m>, first substitute <m>\frac1x</m> for <m>y</m> giving <m>
\frac1x\lt \eps</m>. Solve this for <m>x</m> (remember that if <m>a\lt b</m>
then <m>\frac1a\gt \frac1b</m>) so that  <m> x\gt \frac1\eps</m>.
</p>
<p>

Do you see the significance of this? Because we left <m>\eps</m>
unspecified (other than requiring it to be positive), we<rsq/>ve met all
possible challenges. If the challenge is to make <m>y</m> less than
<m>10^{-1000000000}</m> our response is, <q>We<rsq/>ve already done that. Just
take <m>\eps= 10^{-1000000000} </m>.</q>  Repeating the computation above gives
<m>x\gt10^{1000000000} </m>.
</p>
<p>

 Now for some function <m>f(x)</m>, the statement
<m>\tlimit{x}{\infty}{f(x)}=0</m> has the following precise meaning:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
    If for each <m>\eps\gt0</m> we can make <m>f(x)\lt \eps</m> by
    taking <m>x</m> sufficiently large, then
             we say that <q>the limit as <m>x</m> approaches infinity is zero.</q>
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>

To be sure, when we allow <m>\eps\gt0</m> to be arbitrary, but unspecified
we skirt the edge of the infinitely small. But this is the point. If
<m>\eps</m> is arbitrary then it can be as small as we need for it to be
without ever being infinitely small. This is akin to Euclid allowing
lines to be extended to any, unspecified,
length without allowing them to be infinite in length.  This is the
idea underlying limits and limit notation.
</p>


<aside>
<title>Mathematical Nomenclature</title>
<p>
Be
  careful. Unspecified does not mean variable. <m>\eps</m> is a
  particular, fixed number. We just don<rsq/>t know which one it is.
</p>
</aside>


<p>

Be aware that the meaning of the limit notation and the way we tend to
speak about limits are inconsistent. This can present a lot of
problems for the beginner.  If we are speaking loosely, among friends,
we would read this statement, <m>\tlimit{x}{\infty}{\frac1x}=0</m>,
as: <q>The limit of one over <m>x</m> as <m>x</m> goes to infinity is
  equal to zero.</q>  This is a very poor way to express the idea we
are trying to capture. To say that <m>x</m> <q>approaches</q> infinity
completely undercuts everything we<rsq/>ve said about infinity so far
because it treats infinity as if it is an actual number.
</p>
<p>

We now understand that <m>\tlimit{x}{\infty}{\frac1x}=0 </m> really
means that as <m>x</m> increases without bound, <m>1/x</m> is getting
arbitrarily close to zero but what we say is not what the
notation means.  That incongruity can be very confusing at
first.  In this text we will be very careful not to speak so
casually. At least not until we have more experience with limits.
</p>
<p>

We have only begun, but this is enough for us to offer a first
definition of the limit concept. We generalize slightly.
</p>

<definition xml:id="DEFINITIONsecond-inad-limit-at-infinity">
<title>Positive Function With Limit Zero at Infinity</title>
<statement>
<p>
  <!-- \label{def:second-inad-limit-at-infinity} -->
  Suppose <m>f(x)\gt 0</m> for all <m>x\gt 0.</m> Then we say that
  <m>
  \limit{x}{\infty}{f(x)}=0
  </m>
  if and only if for every <m>\eps\gt 0</m> we can find a real number <m>B</m>
  with the property that if <m>x\gt B</m>, then <m>f(x)\lt \eps</m>.

</p>
</statement>
</definition>
<p>

The parameter <m>B</m> is the lower bound that <m>x</m> has to exceed
for <m>f(x)</m> to be less than <m> \eps</m>.  In our first example we
had <m>B=2</m>, in our last we had <m>B=1/\eps</m>. Naming the lower
bound like this gives us a concrete way to specify how large <m>x</m>
has to be. To great extent finding <m>B</m> is the whole problem. This
is easier to see in an example.
</p>

<example xml:id="EXAMPLELimPosFuncInf">
<p>
  Show that if <m>f(x)=\frac{1}{x^2},</m> then <m>\limit{x}{\infty}{f(x)}=0.</m>
  
  As before take <m>\eps\gt 0</m>. (Think of epsilon as
  being handed to you by Bishop Berkeley. You don<rsq/>t get to control
  it, he does. Moreover all he will tell you about it is that it is a
  positive number.)
</p>
<p>
  Once epsilon is given your job is to find out how large <m>x</m>
  has to be  to guarantee that <m>f(x)=\frac{1}{x^2}\lt \eps.</m>
  So we work the problem backwards. That is, we start with
  <m> f(x)=\frac{1}{x^2}\lt \eps</m> and solve for <m>\eps</m> to find that
  <m>    x\gt   \frac{1}{\sqrt{\eps}}</m>.

 If we take <m>B=\frac{1}{\sqrt{\eps}}</m> when
  <m> x\gt B=\frac{1}{\sqrt{\eps}}</m> then
  <me>
  f(x)= \frac{1}{x^2}\lt \eps.

<title>Refining the Definition</title>

<p>
<xref ref="DEFINITIONsecond-inad-limit-at-infinity">Definition</xref> works as long as
<m>f(x)\gt 0</m>, but without this restriction it fails utterly as our
next example shows:
</p>

<example xml:id="EXAMPLElimit1">
<p>
  Suppose <m>f(x) = -2-\frac{1}{x}.</m> Can you guess the value of <m>\limit{x}{\infty}{f(x)}</m>?

  Let <m>\eps\gt 0</m> be given. Then when <m>B</m> has any positive
  value,  if <m>x\gt B</m> we have
  <me>
  f(x) = -2-\frac1x \lt  0 \lt  \eps,
  </me>
  and by <xref ref="DEFINITIONsecond-inad-limit-at-infinity"></xref> we
  conclude that <m>\tlimit{x}{\infty}{f(x)} =0</m> since all of the requirements
  of our definition have been met (except, of course, <m>f(x)\gt0</m>).

  Of course, this is nonsense. As we have noted  as <m>x</m> increases without bound
  <m>\frac1x</m> gets arbitrarily close to zero. So clearly
  <m>\tlimit{x}{\infty}{f(x)}=-2</m>. That we are able to <q>prove</q> that
  <m>f(x)</m> goes to zero simply means that
  <xref ref="DEFINITIONsecond-inad-limit-at-infinity"></xref> doesn<rsq/>t capture
  everything we need.

  We need a more encompassing definition of a limit.
  </p>
</example>
<p>

Based on our experience in <xref ref="EXAMPLElimit1">Example</xref> with
<m>f(x) = -2-\frac1x</m>, what would you say needs to be changed in
<xref ref="DEFINITIONsecond-inad-limit-at-infinity"></xref> to allow
<m>f(x)\le0</m> as well?
</p>
<p>


The problem of course, is that if <m>\eps\gt 0</m> is given the statement <m>f(x) \lt  \eps</m> doesn<rsq/>t
really capture the idea that <m>f(x)</m> is near the number zero, only that it
is less than the number <m>\eps</m>. For example,  <m>-1000</m> is less than
<m>\eps</m> but it is nowhere near zero. What we need is a way to measure
how far <m>f(x)</m> is from zero, regardless of whether in the positive or
the negative direction.
</p>
<p>

 That is exactly what the absolute value function
measures. For example, both <m>3</m> and <m>-3</m> are the same distance from
zero, the first  one in the positive and the second one in the
negative direction. That is
<m>\abs{3}=\abs{-3}=3</m>.
</p>
<p>


We need to modify our definition so that the distance from <m>y</m> to zero
is less than <m>\eps</m>. We want <m>\abs{y}\lt \eps,</m> not just
<m>y\lt \eps</m>.

<example xml:id="EXAMPLEFormalLimitProof2">
<p>
  Our previous examples and problems in this section were fairly
  simple as formal limit problems go. This one is more complex.
</p>
<p>
  
  Use  <xref ref="DEFINITIONlimit-at-infinity-nearly-adequate"></xref> to show that
  <m>\tlimit{x}{\infty}{\frac{1}{5x-x^2}}=0</m>.
</p>
</example>

  <investigation>
<p>
   For a given <m>\eps\gt0</m>, we want to end up with
    <me>
    \abs{\frac{1}{5x-x^2}}\lt\eps.
    </me>
    Part of what makes this limit more complex is that the part inside
    the absolute value <m>\frac{1}{5x-x^2}</m>, is not always positive.  We
    need to deal with that somehow.
</p>
<p>

 First, since we are only concerned about what happens as
 <m>x\rightarrow\infty</m> it  is safe to assume that <m>x\gt0</m>. In that
 case, <m>x=\abs{x}</m>.
    Next, observe that if  <m>x\gt 5</m> also, then <m>x^2\gt 5x</m>. Thus <m>5x-x^2\lt0</m>, so
    that <m>\abs{\frac{1}{5x-x^2}}=\frac{1}{x^2-5x}</m>. We could now work
    backwards like before, and solve for
    <m>\frac{1}{x^2-5x}\lt\eps</m>. This will work fine, but the Algebra
    gets very messy. Try it and see.
</p>
<p>

    There is a sneaky way to do this that avoids some of the Algebra.
    Notice that <m>\frac{1}{x^2-5x}=\left(\frac{1}{x-5}\right)\cdot\left(\frac1x\right)</m>. Notice
    further that if <m>x\gt6</m>, then <m>x-5\gt1</m> so that
    <m>\frac{1}{x-5}\lt1</m>.  Putting all of this together we we that for
    <m>x\gt6</m>,

    <md>
      <mrow>      \abs{\frac{1}{5x-x^2}}\amp =\abs{\frac{1}{5-x}}\cdot\abs{\frac1x}</mrow>
      <mrow>      \amp =\left(\frac{1}{x-5}\right)\cdot\left(\frac1x\right)</mrow>
      <mrow>      \amp \lt 1\cdot\left(\frac1x\right)=\frac1x.</mrow>
    </md>

</p>
<p>

    Thus to guarantee that <m> \abs{\frac{1}{5x-x^2}}\lt\eps</m> we need
    <m>\frac1x\lt\eps</m>, or <m>x\gt\frac{1}{\eps}</m>.

</proof>

<example>
<!-- <title></title> -->
<p>
In <xref ref="SECTIONhoriz-asympt-as"></xref> we approached the problem of
finding  a horizontal asymptote of
<m>f(x)=\frac{5x}{x+1}</m> in the following highly intuitive manner, using
the <q><m>\approach{\infty}</m></q> notation.
<md>
<mrow>\limit{x}{\infty}{\frac{5x}{x+1}} =
\limit{x}{\infty}{\frac{5x}{x\left(1+\frac1x\right)}}\amp{} =
  \limit{x}{\infty}{\frac{5}{1+\frac1x}}
</mrow>
<mrow>
\amp{}=
  \frac{5}{1+\frac{1}{\approach{\infty}}}=\frac{5}{1+0}=5.
</mrow>
  </md>
  So we see that this limit must be equal to five. To prove this
  rigorously, without referring to infinity, we use
  <xref ref="DEFINITIONlimit-at-posinfinity"></xref>
</p>
</example>
<investigation>
<p>

  Let <m>\eps\gt0 </m> be given. As before we
   work backwards from our goal, <m>\abs{\frac{5x}{x+1}-5}\lt\eps</m>.

<md>
<mrow>
    \abs{\frac{5x}{x+1}-5}\amp\lt\eps
</mrow>
<mrow>\abs{\frac{5x-5(x+1)}{x+1}}\amp\lt \eps</mrow>
<mrow>\abs{\frac{-5}{x+1}}\amp\lt\eps</mrow>
<mrow>\frac{\abs{-5}}{\abs{x+1}}\amp\lt\eps.</mrow>
</md>
As long as <m>x\gt-1</m> this is the same as 

<men  xml:id="EQUATIONLimAtInfExample1">
\frac{5}{x+1}\lt\eps,
</men>

  so we will stipulate that <m>B</m> (and therefore <m>x</m>) must be  at least greater than <m>-1</m>.
  Solving <xref ref="EQUATIONLimAtInfExample1">equation</xref> for
  <m>x</m> we see that
  <m>
  x\gt \frac5\eps-1
  </m>
  also.
  So we take <m>B</m> to be the greater of <m>-1</m> and <m>\frac5\eps-1</m>. We capture
  this idea with the notation,  <m>B=\max\left(-1, \frac5\eps-1\right)</m>.

<title>Limits at a Real Number</title>

<p>
In the previous section we
were focused on the relatively simple limits associated with
horizontal asymptotes.  But our goal is to use the limit in
<xref ref="DEFINITIONDerivative"></xref> to prove that the Differentiation
Rules we<rsq/>ve been using are valid. To do that we will use the following
precise, rigorous definition of a limit as <m>x\rightarrow a</m> where <m>a</m>
is some real number.
</p>

<definition xml:id="DEFINITIONlimits-at-real">
<title>The Limit at a Point</title>

  <!-- \label{def:limits-at-real} -->
  Suppose <m>f(x)</m> is  a function, and that <m>a</m> is a real number. We  say that
  <me>
  \limit{x}{a}{f(x)}=L
  </me>
  if and only if for every <m>\eps\gt 0</m> there is a <m>\delta\gt 0</m> with the property
  that whenever <m>0\lt\abs{x-a}\lt \delta</m>, <m>\abs{f(x)-L}\lt \eps</m>.
</p>
</statement>
</definition>
<p>
Take particular notice of the fact that neither <xref

ref="DEFINITIONlimits-at-real"></xref> tells us how to compute the
limit. They serve only to rigorously establish what our intuition says
the limit should be.

We use  <xref ref="DEFINITIONlimits-at-real"></xref> the same way we used
<xref ref="DEFINITIONlimit-at-posinfinity">Definition</xref>: We take <m>\eps\gt0</m> as a
challenge and find conditions which guarantee that
<m>\abs{f(x)-L}\lt\eps</m>. Previously we were interested in the behavior
of <m>f(x)</m> <q>close to infinity</q> so the condition was that <m>x\gt B</m>
(that <m>x</m> was large enough, loosely speaking). Now we are interested
in the behavior of <m>f(x)</m> <q>close to <m>a</m></q> so we
need to
indicate how close <m>x</m> has to be to <m>a</m>.  The <m>\delta\gt0</m> in
<xref ref="DEFINITIONlimits-at-real"></xref> plays the same role that the
upper bound <m>B</m> played in <xref ref="DEFINITIONlimit-at-posinfinity"></xref> and
<xref ref="DEFINITIONlimit-at-neginfinity"></xref>. It locates where <m>x</m> must be in
order to guarantee that <m>\abs{f(x)-L}\lt\eps</m>.

The sketch below  depicts the situation when
<m>\limit{x}{a}{f(x)}=L</m> visually.  We have indicated that <m>f(x)</m> is not defined at <m>a</m>, but it
could be. Limits don<rsq/>t care what happens at <m>a</m>, only what
happens near <m>a</m>. To emphasize this point we will usually say that
<m>0\lt\abs{x-a}\lt\delta</m>, rather than <m>\abs{x-a}\lt\delta</m>. Because
the inequality on the left is strict, we do not consider what happens
when <m>x=a</m>.

<example>
<p>
 Observe that it is intuitively clear that if <m>f(x)=-x^2+2</m> then
 <m>\limit{x}{0}{f(x)}=2</m>. We wish to prove this rigorously.
</p>
</example>
  <investigation>
<p>

    Suppose <m>\eps\gt0</m> is given.
    Our goal is to find a <m>\delta\gt0</m> such that if
    <m>0\lt\abs{x-0}\lt\delta</m> (or just <m>0\lt\abs{x}\lt\delta</m>) then <m>
   p \abs{f(x)-2}\lt \eps</m>.
Solving this for <m>x</m> we have

<mrow>      \abs{-x^2}\amp \lt \eps</mrow>
<mrow>      \abs{x^2}\amp \lt \eps.</mrow>
</md>

    Recall from <xref ref="DIGRESSIONAbsValSqrt"></xref> that
    <m>\sqrt{x^2}=\abs{x}</m>, so we see that <m> \abs{x}\lt \sqrt{\eps} </m>

      It appears that <m> \abs{f(x)-2}\lt \eps</m> as long as

<alert>END OF SCRAPWORK</alert>

   </investigation>
<p>

   This was the scrapwork. The proof consists of showing that the
   condition we found, <m>\abs{x}\lt\delta(=\sqrt{\eps})</m>, actually
   works.
</p>

  <proof>
<p>
    Let <m>\eps\gt 0</m> be given. Take <m>\delta=\sqrt{\eps}\gt0</m>.
</p>
<p>

    Assume that <m>0\lt \abs{x}\lt \delta</m>.  Then
    \begin{align*}
      \abs{x}\amp \lt \delta
      \sqrt{x^2}\amp \lt \sqrt{\eps}
      x^2 \amp \lt \eps
      \abs{-x^2} \amp \lt \eps
      \abs{-x^2+2-2} \amp \lt \eps
      \abs{f(x)-2} \amp \lt \eps.
    \end{align*}
    Therefore <m>\limit{x}{0}{f(x)}=2</m>.
</p>
<p>
<alert><m>\halmos</m></alert>
</p>
</proof>

<p>

  Notice that our proof does not give us any new information since
    it is intuitively clear that <m>\limit{x}{0}{(-x^2+2)}=2</m>. The formalism of
    a limit merely confirms, in a manner even Bishop Berkeley would
    accept, what we already know to be true.
</p>
<p>
 
    Incidentally, since <m>f(0)=-0^2+2=2</m> we have also just proved that
    <m>f(x)</m> is continuous at <m>x=0</m>. See <xref ref="DEFINITIONcontinuity"></xref>.
</p>
<p>



  For simple problems like this one the proof consisted of writing the
  algebraic steps from our <term>Scrapwork</term>  backwards, as you see. This
  worked because every algebraic step in the <term>Scrapwork</term>  was
  reversible. But don<rsq/>t jump to conclusions. This will not always be
  the case.
</p>
<p>

  Clearly the <term>Scrapwork</term>  is the most important part of the solution
  process for this problem. In a very real sense it actually is the
  solution. We call it <term>Scrapwork</term>  because it is the part of the work
  that you don<rsq/>t show anyone else because it is messy and not well
  organized\aside{We kept it clean and orderly here so you could see
    the reasoning.}.  The scrapwork is like the scaffolding used to
  construct a building. The proof is the building.
</p>
<p>

  It is absolutely necessary to have the scaffolding while
  construction is ongoing but you tear it down and clean everything up
  before you move in. In the same way your proof should be a cleaned
  up version of your scrapwork.  If this example were a homework
  problem, your solution would be the part that appears between
  <alert>Proof</alert> and the little black square, <m>\halmos</m>, at the end.

  Contrary to a popular joke it does not mean <q>Quite Easily

<example xml:id="EXAMPLEConcrete1">

  <!-- \label{example:Concrete1} -->
<p>

 We would like to find the value of
  <m>\limit{x}{\frac12}{\frac{4x^2-1}{2x-1}}</m>, and prove that the value
  we find is correct.
</p>
<p>
   
 Remember that none of our limit definitions tell us how to find the
  value of a limit, only how to prove that it has a particular value
  after we<rsq/>ve found it. In our examples so far the value of the limits
  have been intuitively clear so we haven<rsq/>t concerned ourselves with
  this part of the problem.  But before we can prove that a limit has
  a particular value we obviously need to decide what we believe the
  limit value is.
</p>
<p>

  We have several options for doing this. The simplest is guessing,
  but guessing works best if we have some intuition about the problem.
  Guessing blindly is usually a waste of time. Nevertheless, guessing is
  always an option. Can you guess the value of this limit?
</p>
<p>
  
  Another simple option is to use a calculator and plug the value of
  the limit point, in this case <m>x=\frac12</m>, and see what the
  calculator comes up with. This will work if the function is
  continuous at the limit point. But <m>\frac{4x^2-1}{2x-1}</m> is not
continuous at <m>x=\frac12</m> so that won<rsq/>t help with this problem. Try it
and see.
</p>

<!--     \centerline{\includegraphics*[height=1.8in,width=1.8in]{../Figures/EpsDelta4}} -->
<!--     \label{fig:EpsDelta4} -->
<!--   \end{wrapfigure} -->
<p>
A third, and much more useful option is to sketch the graph of <m>f(x)</m>
to see what <m>f(x)</m> is close to near the limit point.  The graph of
<m>f(x)=\frac{4x^2-1}{2x-1}</m> is given at the right. It is not defined at
<m>x=1/2</m> because when <m>x=1/2</m> we get zero in the
denominator. Nevertheless the limit at <m>x=1/2</m> seems to exist. As you
can see as <m>x</m> approaches <m>1/2</m>, <m>f(x)</m> appears to approach <m>2</m>. Based
on this graph it seems likely that the value of the limit is <m>2</m>.
</p>
<p>
As we saw in <xref ref="CHAPTERlimits-lhop-rule"></xref>, Algebra can also be
very helpful. In this case we see that
  <me>
  \frac{4x^2-1}{2x-1}= {\frac{(2x+1)(2x-1)}{2x-1}}=
  (2x+1)\cdot\CancelToRed{=1}{\frac{2x-1}{2x-1}}=
  (2x+1)
  </me>
  where the cancellation in red is only valid when <m>x\neq\frac12</m>,
  our limit point is <m>x=\frac12</m> so it is not under consideration.
</p>
<p>
  In fact, once we have rigorously proved <xref ref="THEOREMLimProd2"></xref>, and
  <xref ref="THEOREMConstLimit"></xref> from
  <xref ref="SECTIONlimit-theorems-laws"></xref> (We will do this in
  <xref ref="SECTIONLimitLaws"></xref>)
the following will be a valid
  proof:

<md>
<mrow>\limit{x}{\frac12}{\frac{4x^2-1}{2x-1}}\amp =
    \limit{x}{\frac12}{\frac{(2x+1)(2x-1)}{2x-1}}</mrow>
<mrow>\amp =
  \left[\limit{x}{\frac12}{(2x+1)}\right]\left[\limit{x}{\frac12}{\CancelToRed{=1}{\frac{2x-1}{2x-1}}}\
    \ \ \ \ \ \right]</mrow>
<mrow>\amp =
    \limit{x}{\frac12}{(2x+1)}
    </mrow>
<mrow>    \amp = 2.
</mrow>
</md>
</p>





</example>
  <problem>
<statement>
<p>
    Identify where we used <xref ref="THEOREMLimSum2"></xref>,
    <xref ref="THEOREMLimProd2"></xref>, and
    <xref ref="THEOREMConstLimit"></xref> in the development above.
  </p>
</statement>
</problem>
<p>

  Because we haven<rsq/>t yet rigorously proved
  <xref ref="THEOREMLimSum2"></xref>, <xref  ref="THEOREMLimProd2"></xref>, or <xref ref="THEOREMConstLimit"></xref> we
  can<rsq/>t use them to construct a rigorous proof. Until they are proved
  they are not known, they are just believed. Belief is not knowledge.
</p>
<p>

  But there is no problem with using them to gather evidence.
  So far we have strong evidence that this limit is <m>2</m>.
</p>
<p>

Having gathered our evidence, we now believe that <m>
\limit{x}{\frac12}{\frac{4x^2-1}{2x-1}}=2</m>. Next we need to do the
scrapwork for our proof.
</p>

<investigation>
<p>
As always we work backwards from our
goal. We need to show that   <m>\abs{f(x)-2}\lt \eps</m> so
<me>\abs{\frac{4x^2-1}{2x-1}-2} \lt \eps.</me>
Since we<rsq/>re not interested in the value of anything
  at <m>x=\frac12</m> (where the denominator is zero) we can factor and cancel, giving

<md>
<mrow>\abs{\frac{(2x+1)\cancel{(2x-1)}}{\cancel{2x-1}}-2}\amp \lt \eps</mrow>
<mrow>\abs{2x+1-2}\amp \lt \eps</mrow>
<mrow>\abs{2x-1}  \amp \lt \eps.</mrow>
</md>

  We see that if  <m>\abs{2x-1}  \lt \eps</m> then
    <me>
    -\eps \lt 2x-1  \lt \eps
    </me>
    or
    <me>
    \frac12-\frac{\eps}{2}\lt x\lt \frac12+\frac{\eps}{2}.
    </me>
    So  taking <m>\delta=\frac{\eps}{2}</m> will work for this problem.
</p>
<p>
<alert>END OF SCRAPWORK</alert>
</p>
</investigation>

<proof>
<p>
  Let <m>\eps>0</m> be given. Take <m>\delta=\frac{\eps}{2}\gt0</m>.  Then if <m>0\lt\abs{x-\frac12}\lt\delta</m> we have

<md>
<mrow>    \abs{x-\frac12}\amp \lt\frac{\eps}{2}</mrow>
<mrow>-\frac{\eps}{2}\lt    x-\frac12\amp \lt\frac{\eps}{2}</mrow>
<mrow>-\eps \lt 2x-1  \amp \lt \eps</mrow>
<mrow>-\eps \lt 2x+1-2  \amp \lt \eps.</mrow>
</md>
Since <m>x\neq\frac12</m> we see that

<md>
<mrow>-\eps \lt \frac{(2x+1)(2x-1)}{2x-1} -2 \amp \lt \eps</mrow>
<mrow>-\eps \lt \frac{4x^2-1}{2x+1} -2 \amp \lt \eps</mrow>
<mrow>-\eps \lt f(x) -2 \amp \lt \eps,</mrow>
</md>
  and so
  <me>
  \abs{f(x)-2}\lt\eps.
  </me>

  Therefore <me>\limit{x}{\frac12}{\frac{4x^2-1}{2x+1}}=2</me>.

  Let <m>\eps\gt 0</m> be given.

  Since <m>\limit{x}{\infty}{f(x)}=L_f</m> there is a bound, <m>B_f</m> such

  Take <m>B= \max(B_f,B_g)</m>. Then if <m>x\gt B</m> then

<p>
It will be  helpful to have a visual guide for this proof so we
will rely on diagrams here in the scrapwork. Our finalized  proof below will not.
</p>
<p>

Let <m>\eps\gt0</m> be given. We need to show that we can find a <m>B\gt0</m>
such that if <m>x\gt B</m> then <m>\abs{f(g(x))-f(L_g)}\lt\eps</m>.
</p>
<p>

Since <m>f</m> is
continuous at <m>y=L_g</m> <xref ref="DEFINITIONcontinuity"></xref> tells us that
<m>\tlimit{y}{L_g}{f(y)}=f(L_g)</m>
</p>
<p>

Thus <xref ref="DEFINITIONlimits-at-real"></xref>  tells us that there
there is a real number <m>\delta>0</m> such that if <m>\abs{y-L_g}\lt\delta</m>
then <m>\abs{f(y)-f(L_g)}\lt\eps</m>, as visualized in the sketch at the
right.
</p>
<p>

Next, consider what it means to say that
<m>\tlimit{x}{\infty}{g(x)}=L_g</m>. It means that if we take <m>x</m> large
enough we can make <m>g(x)</m> as close to <m>L_g</m> as we would like. In
particular, we would like for <m>\abs{g(x)-L_g}\lt\delta</m> as in the
sketch below.
</p>

<image source="images/LimComp1.png" width="70%" />
<!-- \centerline{\includegraphics*[height=1.3in,width=3.5in]{../Figures/LimComp1}} -->
<p>

Therefore, we can find a number <m>B</m> such that for every <m>x\gt B</m>,
<m>\abs{g(x)-L_g}\lt\delta</m>.
If we take  <m>y=g(x)</m>, then we have <m>\abs{y-L_g}\lt\delta</m>.
</p>
<p>



From the continuity of <m>f</m> at <m>L_g</m> we know  that
<m>\abs{g(x)-L_g}=\abs{y-L_g}\lt\delta</m> means that
<me>
\abs{f(g(x))-f(L_g)}=\abs{f(y)-f(L_g)}\lt\eps.
</me>
</p>
<p>
<alert>END OF SCRAPWORK</alert>
</p>
</investigation>

<proof>
<p>
  Let <m>\eps\gt 0</m> be given.
  
  Since <m>f(y)</m> is continuous at <m>L_g</m> there is a real number
  <m>\delta\gt0</m> such that
<me>\text{if }\abs{y-L_g}\lt\delta\text{ then }\abs{f(y)-f(L_g)}\lt\eps.</me>

  Since <m>\tlimit{x}{\infty}{g(x)}=L_g</m> there is a real number <m>B</m> such
  that
  <me>
  \text{ if } x\gt B \text{ then } \abs{g(x)-L_g} \lt \delta.
  </me>
  Take <m>B</m> be the lower bound needed to guarantee that
  <m>\abs{g(x)-L_g}\lt\delta</m>. If <m>x\gt B</m> then since <m>y=g(x)</m>
  <me>
  \abs{y-L_g}=\abs{g(x)-L_g}\lt\delta,
  </me>
  and since  <m> \abs{y-L_g}\lt\delta</m> we see, from the continuity of <m>f</m>
  at <m>L_g</m> that <m>\abs{f(y)-f(L_g)}\lt\eps</m>.

  Therefore <m>
  \limit{x}{\infty}{f(g(x))} = f(L_g) =

<title>Proving <xref ref="LEMMALimProd1"></xref></title>
<p>

To prove <xref ref="LEMMALimProd1"></xref> we need to guarantee that if <m>x</m>
is large enough then
<me>
\abs{f(x)\cdot g(x)-f(x)\cdot L_g} =\abs{f(x)}\abs{g(x)-L_g} \lt \eps,
</me>
where <m>\eps</m>
is an arbitrary, positive, real number. An <q>obvious</q> strategy is to observe
that since we know that <m>\tlimit{x}{\infty}{g(x)}=L_g</m> it must be that
if <m>x</m> is large enough then
<m>\abs{g(x)-L_g} \lt \frac{\eps}{\abs{f(x)}}</m>.
</p>
<p>
 
But that strategy will fail. Here<rsq/>s why.
<xref ref="DEFINITIONlimit-at-posinfinity"></xref> says that if
<m>\limit{x}{\infty}{g(x)}=L_g</m> then for any single real number
<m>\eps</m> we can find a <m>B</m> such that if <m>x\gt B</m> then
<m>\abs{g(x)-L_g}\lt\eps.</m> But <m>\frac{\eps}{\abs{f(x)}}</m> is not a single
real number. For each distinct value of <m>x>B</m> we<rsq/>ll have a (possibly)
different value of <m>f(x)</m>.  We have no definition, and no theorem that
says we can do this. So we can<rsq/>t. That strategy won't work.
At least it won<rsq/>t work in its most obvious form.
</p>
<p>

But it will work if we can  replace <m>\abs{f(x)}</m> by some
fixed value.  The following lemma states that since <m>f(x)</m> has a
finite limit, it must be bounded. This will allow us to replace
<m>\abs{f(x)}</m> with that bound, which is a fixed parameter, in our proof
of <xref ref="LEMMALimProd1"></xref>.

Finally, we come to the limit of a quotient. Given how much trouble
the limit of a product gave us, it is a little scary to think about
proving that the limit of a quotient is the quotient of limits from
the definition.
</p>
<p>

This trepidation is justified. It is very tricky to prove --- from the
definition --- that the limit of a quotient is what we expect it to
be. Fortunately we won<rsq/>t have to. We now have enough theorems
(tools) available that we no longer have to work directly from the limit
definition.

However we will need to dispose of the following small detail.

<title>The Function    <m>f(x)=\frac1x</m> is Continuous

<lemma xml:id="LEMMA1overxIsCont">
<p>
    The function <m>f(x)=\frac1x</m> is continuous at <m>a\neq0</m>.
  </p>
</lemma>
<p>
  You will need <xref ref="LEMMA1overxIsCont">Lemma</xref> to solve
  <xref ref="PROBLEMProofOfQuotLim">Problem</xref> below.  We will provide the
  scrapwork and leave the formal proof as a problem for you.
</p>
<investigation>
 <p> To keep things simple (this is scrapwork, after all) we will first
  assume that <m>a\gt0</m>. If we have an <m>\eps\gt0</m> then by
  <xref ref="DEFINITIONcontinuity">Theorem</xref> we need to find a <m>\delta\gt0</m> such
  that if <m>\abs{x-a}\lt\delta</m> then <m>\abs{\frac1x-\frac1a}\lt\eps</m>. As
  usual we work backwards.
</p>
<p>

  Combining the fractions we see that
  <me>
  \abs{\frac1x-\frac1a}=\frac{\abs{a-x}}{a\abs{x}}=\frac{\abs{x-a}}{a\abs{x}},
  </me>
  so  we need to find a <m>\delta\gt0</m> such that <m>\abs{x-a}\lt\delta</m>
  ensures that <m>\frac{\abs{x-a}}{a\abs{x}}\lt\eps</m>.
</p>
<p>

  At first it appears that all we need to do choose
  <m>\delta \lt \eps\cdot a \cdot\abs{x}</m>. If we could do that we<rsq/>d have
  <m> \abs{x-a}\lt\delta = \eps\cdot a \cdot\abs{x}</m> in which case
  <me>
  \abs{\frac1x-\frac1a}=\frac{\abs{x-a}}{a\abs{x}}=\frac{\abs{x-a}}{a}\cdot\frac{1}{\abs{x}}\lt\eps.
  </me>
</p>
<p>

  But of course we<rsq/>ve seen this before. Just as in the proof of
  <xref ref="LEMMALimProd1">Lemma</xref>, <m>\delta</m> must be a constant; it cannot
  depend on <m>x</m>. So we need to replace <m>\frac1x</m> with a constant
  somehow.
  The Algebra here gets  a bit delicate. We strongly recommend that you
  visualize each step of the following argument with a  sketch like
  the one we used in the scrapwork for <xref ref="THEOREMLimCompInf">Theorem</xref>
</p>
<p>

  Suppose we choose <m>\delta\gt0</m> such that
<me>    \abs{x-a} \lt\frac{a}{2}.</me>
Then we see that
<me>    -\frac{a}{2}\lt x-a \lt\frac{a}{2}</me>
or

<mdn>
<mrow  xml:id="EQUATION1overXBndFromZero">
   \frac{a}{2}\amp{}=a -\frac{a}{2}\lt x
% \label{eq:1overXBndFromZero}
   </mrow>
   <mrow number="no">
    \amp \lt a+\frac{a}{2}=\frac{3a}{2}.
</mrow>
</mdn>

  Thus if we make <m>\abs{x-a}\lt\frac{a}{2}</m>, we see that
  <m>0\lt\frac{a}{2}\lt x</m> and so, not the right side.}
  <me>
  \frac{1}{\abs{x}}=\frac{1}{x}\lt\frac{2}{a}
  </me>
  for all <m>x\gt0</m>.
  </p>
  <aside>
<title>Comment</title>
<p>
Notice that we are using the left side of <xref
ref="EQUATION1overXBndFromZero"></xref>
</p>
</aside>

<p>

  Therefore
  <m>\abs{\frac1x-\frac1a}=\frac{\abs{x-a}}{a}\cdot\frac{1}{\abs{x}}\lt\frac{2}{a^2}\abs{x-a}</m>. Thus
  if we choose <m>\delta</m> to be  the lesser of <m>\frac{a}{2}</m> and
  <m>\frac{\eps a^2}{2}</m> we have everything we need to conclude that
  <m>\tlimit{x}{a}{\frac1x}=\frac1a</m> for <m>a\gt 0.</m>

 We have one last loose end to tie up. Recall that
 <xref ref="THEOREMOneSideLim"></xref> in
 <xref ref="CHAPTERwhen-deriv-doesnt">Chapter</xref> says that a limit exists if and
 only if the right- and left-hand limits both exist and are
 equal. One-sided limits are informally defined in

 not sufficiently precise to support constructing a proof, so here is

 As you can see, rigorous demonstrations, as necessary as they are,
 can become complicated and tedious.  Perhaps this explains why the
 practice of Calculus predated its theory.
</p>
<p>

 We have defined the derivative by <xref ref="DEFINITIONDerivative">Definition</xref>,
  derived all of our differentiation rules via this definition,
 and shown <mdash/> rigorously <mdash/> that founding Calculus on the
 theory of limits gives us all of the properties we found useful in
 <xref ref="FromPractice"></xref>Part 1 of this textbook. At long last, this places a solid,
 logical, and rigorous foundation underneath the Differential Calculus
 of Newton and Leibniz.

<p>

And Bishop Berkeley has nothing left to criticize.
