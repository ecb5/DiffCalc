Since the Covid-19 pandemic of $2020$ the following story has become
very popular. In $1665$ an outbreak of Bubonic Plague\aside{Also called the
  Black Death.} closed Cambridge University.  One of the students, a
young man named
\href{https://mathshistory.st-andrews.ac.uk/Biographies/Newton/}{Isaac
  Newton}, decided to continue his studies on his own at his country
home in Woolsthorpe, Lincolnshire, UK. It was during this time that
Newton worked out the basic principles of Optics, his Law of Universal
Gravitation, and his version of the Calculus. He was under $25$ years
old at the time.

The basic facts of this story are essentially correct. The Plague did
close Cambridge University in $1665$, Newton was under $25$, he did
retire to Woolsthorpe, and he did investigate
Optics and Gravitation during this time. The mathematics that he needed did not exist at the time
so he invented it. Today we call it Calculus.

But telling Newton's story this way is misleading. It leaves the
impression that he did all of these things during his two years at
Woolsthorpe; sewed them up in a neat little package; bequeathed them
to the rest of humanity and then ascended directly into heaven as a
scientific demi-god.

  \label{fig:Newton}
\end{wrapfigure}
This is not true\aside{To be sure Newton did a \emph{lot} during his
  retreat to Woolsthorpe, and he was a scientific demi-god. But if he
  ascended into heaven he did it in the usual way in $1727$ at the age
  of $84$.}. In fact,  he continued to work on optics after returning to
Cambridge, but did not publish his first results until $1672$. He
worked on his gravitational theory until at least $1687$ when he
published  the first edition of his book \pubtitle{Philosophiae
  Naturalis Principia Mathematica} (Mathematical Principles of Natural
Philosopy\aside{It is usually just called \pubtitle{The Principia}.}).


When you're a genius you can do that.

Newton's story is often treated as inspirational but the fact that he
did so much, so young seems to us (the authors of this book) more
intimidating than inspiring. We are considerably older than $25$ and
taken together we haven't done anything as impressive as Newton did
in his youth.

But comparing ourselves to Newton is pointless. Newton was a true
genius.  We are merely ordinary people just like you. We didn't invent
Calculus, and you don't have to either. Newton did that for
us. Everyone since has merely had to learn it; a much less imposing
task.

Well, almost everyone.

About ten years after Newton entered Cambridge University, and quite
independently,
\href{https://mathshistory.st-andrews.ac.uk/Biographies/Leibniz}{Gottfried
  Wilhelm Leibniz} developed his rules for Calculus while employed as a
diplomat in Paris from $1672$ to $1674.$ He was $26$ years old at the
time.


\begin{wrapfigure}[17]{r}{2in}
  \vskip-7mm{}

  \label{fig:Leibniz}
\end{wrapfigure}

Though their approaches are fundamentally different, the computational
techniques they worked out were essentially equivalent.  Newton's
approach was dynamic. He was thinking about objects in motion: the
moon, the planets, and falling apples. Leibniz was thinking about
geometric relationships, more like Fermat or Descartes.

As a matter of pure logic it doesn't really matter which viewpoint is
adopted. However, there are some situations where thinking dynamically
(like Newton) is more helpful, and others where thinking geometrically
(like Leibniz) is more helpful. Throughout this text we will switch
back and forth, adopting whichever approach seems to us more
advantageous for a given situation. You should too.

Newton was a private, almost secretive man. At first he didn't tell
anyone about his invention and so Leibniz was the one to publish the first
paper on Calculus  in $1684$. We referred to his paper at the end of
Chapter~\ref{chapter:ScienceBeforeCalc}:
\begin{center}
  \begin{minipage}{.8\linewidth}
    \pubtitle{A New Method for Maxima and Minima, as Well as Tangents,
      Which is Impeded Neither by Fractional nor Irrational
      Quantities, and a Remarkable Type of Calculus for This.}
  \end{minipage}
\end{center}
From this rather imposing title we can infer that Leibniz was aware the
Calculus would empower mathematicians to more easily solve both old
problems (like Snell's Law) and new problems alike.

In his paper Leibniz displayed all of the General Differentiation
Rules you will see at the beginning of the next section. He called his
computational rules ``\foreign{Calculus Differentialis}'' which
translates loosely as ``rules for differences.''  In English this is
called \term{Differential Calculus}.

Newton and Leibniz each created and used a notation that reflected his
own viewpoint.  Newton's notation has (mostly) fallen away over the
years. Leibniz' notation is much more intuitive and has become
standard in mathematics.

Both assumed that a varying quantity could be increased or decreased
by an infinitely small amount. Leibniz called this an infinitesimal
difference, or a \term{differential} and denoted it with the letter
``d'' -- presumably for ``differential''.  So if $x$ is some quantity,
then its differential, $\dx{x}$, represents an infinitely small
increase or decrease in $x.$

To talk of infinitely small increments may sound strange to you. It
does to most people, because it is in fact a truly weird
idea. \href{https://mathshistory.st-andrews.ac.uk/Biographies/Bernoulli_Johann/}{Johann
  Bernoulli}\aside{Johann and his brother Jacob both learned Calculus
  from Leibniz, and both went on to mathematical greatness in their
  own right} described differentials this way:
``a quantity which is increased or decreased by an infinitely small
quantity is neither increased nor decreased\aside{From ``Great Moments
  in Mathematics After 1650'', Lecture 32}.''  You may judge for
yourself how helpful this is.

The idea of an infinitesimal was not new. Before the invention of
Calculus mathematicians had been using the notion
both successfully, and informally, for many years. Galileo and his
students used them. So did Archimedes.  The idea was ``in the air.''

But the vagueness of the notion was very troubling. In fact, late in
his life Newton attempted to repudiate the idea of differentials by
founding his version of Calculus on what he called \emph{prime and
  ultimate ratios}.
Leibniz simply continued the tradition of using differentials and
invented the notational formalism that we still use
today.

Although neither of them could precisely answer the question, ``What is a
differential?''neither Leibniz nor Newton allowed this to hold them
back. They developed their computational schemes, verified that they
worked -- at least on the problems they were interested in
-- and proceeded to use
them to attack other problems. That was enough for them. Both men
followed the example of their forebears and treated the notion of an
infinitely small increment as a convenient fiction. Something
that doesn't exist in reality but is useful as way to think about
certain problems.  We will adopt a similar attitude -- at least for
now.

But this is mathematics. Eventually we will reach a time of reckoning
when we must define our concepts clearly and precisely. All of
them, not just the convenient ones.


The question ``What is a differential?''  cannot simply be swept under
the rug and ignored indefinitely.  Since everything we do will depend
in a fundamental way on differentials, we must resolve this question
or all of our work will rest on a foundation of shifting sands and we
will never really know whether it is valid or not. If we do not
proceed carefully, logically, from clearly stated first principles we
can never truly know if what we are doing is valid.

Indeed,
Newton, Leibniz, and generations of mathematicians since understood
this very well and worked hard to either give rigorous meaning to the
idea of a differential or to abandon it altogether in favor of some
other concept. Newton's idea of prime and ultimate ratios was probably
the first such attempt.


\begin{wrapfigure}[18]{l}{2in}

  \label{fig:Robinson}
\end{wrapfigure}
But it took some of the greatest minds in history nearly two hundred
years to resolve the question of differentials.

Well, \emph{resolve} might be too strong a word.  The theory of limits,
adopted in the late $19$th century, doesn't resolve the matter as much
as it simply avoids it altogether. You'll see what we mean when we
come to Chapter~\ref{cha:formal-limits}

In the mid-twentieth
century
\href{https://mathshistory.st-andrews.ac.uk/Biographies/Robinson}{Abraham
  Robinson} ($1918-1974$) was finally able to put a develop the notion
of a differential in a solid, rigorous manner. Unfortunately, to do
this Robinson required some high level techniques from the field of
Mathematical Logic which are quite beyond the scope of this text.

Besides, Calculus already had a rigorous foundation. The theory of
limits had been established nearly a hundred years before Robinson's
work and it provides an entirely adequate foundation for Calculus.
Unfortunately, the theory of limits does very little to help anyone
actually \emph{use} Calculus. It simply provides rigor for the logical
foundations. On the other hand the differentials of Leibniz and
Robinson do provide aid in using Calculus. Newton, Leibniz, and their
contemporaries did truly amazing things by treating differentials as
\emph{convenient fictions}.  There is no reason we can't do the same.

For now we will follow the example of our
forbears and develop the Rules For Differences
(\alert{Differential Calculus}) using Leibniz' differentials.  In
particular, we will not concern ourselves with the question, ``What is
a differential?''

There is precedent for this. The ancient Greek mathematician
\href{https://mathshistory.st-andrews.ac.uk/Biographies/Euclid/}{Euclid},
(325BC - 265BC)
defined geometric points with the phrase ``A point is that which has
no parts.'' But that is simply a clever way of admitting that he
didn't know what points are, despite the fact that they are enormously
useful.  What is a point, really, but a convenient fiction? And yet
the notion of a point is foundational for all of Geometry. After all,
what is a line but the relationship between two points? Moreover,
mathematical points are highly intuitive and can be visualized in the
mind's eye as long as we don't look too closely.

Differentials will play a similar role in Calculus.

become so skillful that they can use their tools seamlessly; so they
can focus on what they are doing, not how they are doing it. They
don't think of the tool, they think of the task. The tool simply
becomes an extension of their hands.  In precisely the same way, the
differentiation rules we'll be discussing in this chapter are the
basic tools of your trade and you need to become so skillful with them
that you can use them without thinking about them.

The computational rules in the table at the
right are the basic tools of Differential Calculus.  They need to
become an extension of your mind. You need to be able to perform these
calculations while holding a larger problem in your mind. Sometimes a
much larger problem. You need to become so familiar with them that
they become the simple part of bigger problems.

The purpose of this chapter is to give you practice with these
computations; to give you a chance to internalize them before
you have to use them in a larger context.  For that reason we will
be providing a lot of drill problems for you to practice
on. \emph{Do them.}

These drill problems are not important in themselves, but once we move
past this chapter it will be assumed that you can compute a
differential -- even if the computation is long and complex --
easily. If you have not given yourself enough practice here, you will
struggle through the rest of this course. And the ones that come
after. You may even fail.

So, right here, right now,  resolve to do all of the
problems in this chapter. Do them even if your instructor has not
assigned them all. The more practice you get with this now, the less
you will struggle later. Find other problems from other books and do
them too. Make up your own problems. Practice until you can compute a
differential with a quick glance.

\emph{This is important.}  We, the authors of this text, know what we
are talking about. Listen to us. Your goal in this chapter is to
completely internalize these differentiation rules. They need to
become second nature to you. This work will pay off in the long run.

\subsection*{Differentials}
\markright{\sc{}Differentials}


\mycenterquote{It is better to do the right problem the wrong way than
  the wrong problem the right way.}{\href{https://mathshistory.st-andrews.ac.uk/Biographies/Hamming/}{Richard
    W. Hamming} (1915-1998)}{.85}

The General Differentiation Rules are surprisingly
easy to learn and remember. Moreover, despite the fact that we have
six entries in our table there are really  only three rules. The
Constant Rule, The Sum Rule, and the Product Rule are fundamental. The
other three, The Constant Multiple Rule, The Power Rule, and the
Quotient Rule are straightforward consequences of the first three. We
only state them separately for convenience.

We call these rules ``general'' because each one of them can
be applied to a wide variety of expressions. In addition to the
general rules there is a large set of specific rules that only apply
to specific functions. We will come back to these beginning in
Chapter~\ref{cha:calc-trig}


To begin, suppose a point is moving along the $x$-axis. As in
Chapters~\ref{cha:problem-solving} and~\ref{chapter:ScienceBeforeCalc}
when we think of a point in motion we write $x(t)$ to express the idea
that the position $x$, depends on the time, $t$.  At a specific time,
$t$, the position $x(t_1)$, is expressed as more compactly as $x_1$
and at time $t_2$ the position is $x_2$..

The (small, finite) change in $x$ is the difference between $x_2$ and
$x_1$: $x_2-x_1$, and the (small, finite) change in $t$ is the
difference between $t_2$ and $t_1:$ $t_2-t_1$.

It is customary to denote these small, finite changes with the
notation:
$$
\Delta x = x_2-x_1, \text{ and } \Delta t= t_2-t_1.
$$
We will denote infinitely small changes in $x$ and $t$ as $\dx{x}$ and
$\dx{t}$. The symbol $\d{x}$ is called the \term{differential} of $x$.

Notationally, the distinction between $\Delta x$ and $\dx{x}$ is
small, but conceptually it is profound. When we write $\Delta x$ there
is some measurable distance between $x_2$ and $x_1.$ When we write
$\dx{x}$ the distance between $x_2$ and $x_1$ is immeasurably
(infinitesimally) small.

If $x$ is changing in time, $\dx{x}$ represents how much $x$ changes
in an infinitesimally small increment of time $\dx{t}$. If the concept
of an infinitely small increment troubles you (it should) it is safe,
for now, to think of $\dx{x}$ as a very, {\small very,} {\tiny very,}
small change in $x.$


In general, if two variables, say $x$ and $y$, are related we will be
interested in asking (and answering) the question: If $x$ is
incremented by $\dx{x}$ how will $y$ be affected?

\subsection*{The General Differentiation Rules}
\markright{\sc{}The General Differentiation Rules} Now that we
understand our notation the first differentiation rule is quite
obvious. In fact, it is the same whether we are thinking of a small
finite change or of a differential. If $x$ is unchanging, if it is
\emph{not} moving, then ``the (infinitesimal) change in $x$'' between
two different times is zero. It doesn't really matter whether we are
talking about a finite $\Delta x$ or an infinitesimal $\dx{x}$. Both
are zero because $x$ doesn't change. Thus we have the following rule:

<p>
  In the table of General Differentiation Rules at the beginning of
  this chapter we stated the Constant Rule using $a$ as the constant,
  in the statement above we used $x$, and in
  Drill~\#\ref{drill:ConstantRule} we used $y$. Does it matter what
  symbol we use?  Explain.
</p>

</problem>



This first rule was particularly simple since only one quantity was
involved and it was unchanging. The second is only slightly more
complex. Suppose we have two  variable quantities, $x$ and $y$.
Then:

\vskip2mm{}
\noindent\term{\underline{The Sum Rule}:}  $\dx(x+y)=\dx{x}+\dx{y}.$
\vskip2mm{}

If $\textcolor{red}{x_1}$ and $\textcolor{red}{x_2}$ are infinitely
close together, then
$\textcolor{red}{\dx{x}} = \textcolor{red}{x_2}-\textcolor{red}{x_1}.$
Similarly if $\textcolor{blue}{y_1}$ and $\textcolor{blue}{y_2}$ are
infinitely close together then
$\textcolor{blue}{\dx{y}}=\textcolor{blue}{y_2}-\textcolor{blue}{y_1}.$
Then:
\begin{align*}
  \dx(x+y) \amp{}= ({\color{red}{x_2}}+{\color{blue}{y_2}}) -
  ({\color{red}{x_1}}+{\color{blue}{y_1}})\\
  \amp{}= ({\color{red}{x_2-x_1}}) + ({\color{blue}{y_2-y_1}})\\
  \amp{}= {\color{red}{\dx x}} +{\color{blue}{\dx y}},
\end{align*}
which verifies the Sum Rule. Notice that like the Constant Rule, the
Sum Rule is true regardless of whether we are talking about finite
differences or differentials.

The Sum Rule is stated as if it only applies to the sum of \emph{two}
quantities. This is typical of mathematical writing. We tend to be
minimalists so we don't state more than we absolutely have
to. However, if the Sum Rule applies to the sum of two quantities it
is straightforward to show that it also applies in the obvious fashion
to a sum of three, four, or more quantities.

$\dx(ax)=a\dx{x}$. 
\vskip2mm{}

% The Constant Multiple Rule is really a special case of the Product
% Rule below. We state it here first mostly for convenience. 

Suppose $a$ is a constant and $x$ is a variable. Since
$\dx{(ax)}= ax_2-ax_1$ is the differential between infinitely close
values of $ax$ we see that the differential of $ax$ is given by:
$$
\dx{(ax)} = ax_2 - ax_1 = a(x_2-x_1) = a\dx{x}.
$$
which verifies the Constant Multiple Rule.
  
\begin{myexample}
  \label{example:DifferentialRatioIsSlope}
  To get a sense of how we will be using differentials consider the
  line which is the graph of the equation $3x+2y=5$. Let's
  differentiate both sides of this formula using the tools we have so
  far.

  Obviously if two quantities are equal then their differentials are
  also equal. So,\\
  \centerline{ $\dx{(3x+2y)}=\dx{(5)}$.}
  From the Sum Rule and the Constant Rule we have,\\
  \centerline{ $\dx{(3x)}+\dx{(2y)}=0$} and from the Constant Multiple
  Rule we see that,
  \begin{equation}
    3\dx{x}+2\dx{y}=0.\label{eq:slope}  
  \end{equation}

  Notice that Equation~(\ref{eq:slope}) can be rearranged as follows:
  $ \dfdx{y}{x} = -\frac32.  $

  So it appears that the \term{differential ratio} $\dfdx{y}{x}$ is
  the slope of our line. This makes sense since $\dfdx{y}{x}$ is the
  (infinitesimal) change in $y$ divided by the (infinitesimal) change
  in $x$. From your study of lines in Algebra you know that the change
  in $y$ divided by the change in $x$ is the definition of slope. It
  continues to be the slope even if the changes in $x$ and $y$ are
  infinitesimal.

In his $1684$ paper on Calculus, Leibniz presented all of the General
Differentiation Rules with no justification whatsoever, stating simply 
that     {\it{} ``The demonstration of all this will be easy to one who is
    experienced in these matters $\ldots$''}
% \begin{center}
%   \begin{minipage}[h]{.6\linewidth}
%     \it{} ``The demonstration of all this will be easy to one who is
%     experienced in these matters $\ldots$''
%   \end{minipage}
% \end{center}
Our first three rules seem to  bear this out. They are really the
same as the analogous rules for finite differences.  His claim is a
bit more suspect for the next differentiation rule. 

\vskip2mm{}
\noindent{\term{\underline{The Product Rule}}:}  $\dx{(xy)}=x\dx{y}+y\dx{x}.$
\vskip2mm{}

\end{wrapfigure}

Think of the product $xy$ as the (A)rea of the rectangle with sides of
length $x$ and $y$ so that $A=xy$, as shown in the sketch at the
left. If we increase the sides by $\dx{x}$ and $\dx{y}$, respectively,
then the area will change by an infinitesimal amount $\dx{A}$ which is
the sum of areas of the blue, yellow, and red regions shown in the
sketch.  The area of the blue region is $x\dx{y}$, the area of the red
region is $y\dx{x}$ and the area of the yellow region is
$\dx{x}\dx{y}$.  Since $\dx{A}$ is the sum of these three regions we
have
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:DifferentialProductRule}
  \dx{A} =x\dx{y}+y\dx{x}+\dx{x}\dx{y}.
\end{equation}

But remember that $\dx{x}$ and $\dx{y}$ represent infinitely small
changes.  Thus, their product $\dx{x}\dx{y}$ is even more infinitely
small\aside{Quadratically infinitely small?} than they are.  In fact,
the product $\dx{x}$ times $\dx{y}$ is so small compared to any of the
that other terms in Equation~\ref{eq:DifferentialProductRule} that it
simply doesn't matter. So we will ignore it.

This leaves us with $\dx{A}=\d(xy)=x\dx{y}+y\dx{x}$ verifying the
Product Rule.

You should feel at least a little uncomfortable with this logical
sleight of hand. Some questions present themselves immediately: How
can we choose not to ignore infinitesimals like $\dx{x}$ and $\dx{y}$,
but then choose to ignore their product $\dx{x}\dx{y}$? What happens
if $x$ or $y$ is negative? What happens if $\dx{x}$ or $\dx{y}$ is
negative?

Perhaps this is why Leibniz left out the demonstrations (proofs) of
his rules – he knew this would be controversial.  However, he was not
lying when he said that those familiar with infinitesimals would
understand.  Newton also ignored products of infinitesimals in his
version of Calculus.  As we discussed in Section~\ref{sec:hist-intr},
it took mathematicians some $200$ years to sort this out.  We will
begin to address this problem in
Chapter~\ref{chapt:whats-wrong-with}. For now, we will simply accept
that the Product Rule works as we've stated it knowing full well that
we are on shaky ground that will eventually need to be firmed up.

\begin{embeddedproblem-1line}
  \label{problem:dydxIsSlope}
  Use the Product Rule to show that if $y=x^2$, then
  $\dx{y}=2x\dx{x}$.
\end{embeddedproblem-1line}

Even though they could not fully explain their methods, both Newton
and Leibniz could see that their methods gave answers that made sense
physically and which agreed with the results of their predecessors.
That is, their methods worked.

For example, in Problem~\ref{prob:ferm-meth-x2} you used Fermat's
method for tangents to show that at the point $(1,1)$ the slope of the
curve $y=x^2$ is $2$ and that at the point $(-2,4)$ the slope of the
curve is $-4$. Recall from
Example~\ref{example:DifferentialRatioIsSlope} that the differential
ratio $\dfdx{y}{x}$ represents the slope of the curve. With this in
mind we rewrite the formula $\dx{y}=2x\dx{x}$ from
Problem~\#\ref{problem:dydxIsSlope} as $ \dfdx{y}{x}=2x$, from which
we see that the Product Rule easily recovers Fermat's results.

But what can it mean to say that the slope of the graph of $y=x^2$ is
$2x$? The expression $2x$ changes with $x$ but slope is supposed to be
constant isn't it? Moreover, slopes have always been associated with
straight lines in the past, but there is not a straight line to be
seen anywhere in this problem.

Or is there?

The notion of a differential is essentially an extension of the
following observation: If you look very closely at a curve it looks
like a straight line. You can confirm this with any graphing
technology. Graph a curve and zoom in repeatedly at any point on the
curve. Eventually the curve will look like a straight line, and the
slope of that line will be the value of $\dfdx{y}{x}$ at that point.  If
we extend this observation to the infinitely small scale we get
differentials.

The idea that at the infinitely small scale lines and curves are
indistinguishable is known as the \term{Principal of Local Linearity},
and it is a fundamental principle underlying all of Calculus.  We will
formally define the Principle of Local Linearity in
Section~\ref{sec:defin-tang-line}. For now, the informal idea is that
when you look at a very small section of a curve it looks like a
straight line. When we choose to simply ignore the term $\d{x}\d{y}$
in our development of the Product Rule we are invoking the Principle
of Local Linearity\aside{This is true but it is is not at all
  obvious.}.


Again, Newton and Leibniz relied on the fact that their methods
produced solutions that made sense physically and which agreed with
known solutions to old problems. Snell's Law is an example of the
latter. The following problem is an example of the former.

   issues with this solution?  Specifically, why is it important that
   $\d{r}$ must be infinitely small?
 \end{enumerate}
\end{embeddedproblem}

\begin{Digression}[Differential Notation]
  We will pause here for a moment to take explicit notice of the
  notational convenience we used in part (a) of
  Problem~\ref{problem:CircleDifferential}{} because it will be useful
  later.  We have used the expression $\dx{x}$ to represent an
  infinitesimal displacement of $x$, but it will be useful to think of
  the ``$\dx$'' as meaningful in itself. That is, in the expression
  $\dx(\pi r^2)$ we think of the ``d'' as ``operating on'' the
  expression $\pi r^2.$ Thus when $\dx$ ``operates on'' the expression
  $\pi r^2$ it returns the expression $2\pi r\dx{r}$ and we
  have\\\centerline{$\dx{A}=\dx(\pi r^2) = 2\pi r \dx{r}.$} This is
  actually consistent with our previous usage if we think of $\dx(A)$
  as ``operating on'' the area $A$ and returning the differential
  $\dx{A}.$

  This is akin to the way we think about the square root symbol. The
  symbol $\sqrt{\phantom{4}}$ ``operates on'' the expression
  underneath it so we have $\sqrt{4}=2.$ Just as $\sqrt{\phantom{4}}$
  is always reserved for the square root \emph{of some quantity},
  $\dx$ is always reserved for the differential \emph{of some
    quantity}. In both cases the quantity needs to be named. It is as
  meaningless to write $\pi r^2\dx$ as it is to write
  $\pi r^2\sqrt{\phantom{4}}.$ It is important to use the notation as
  it was designed to be used.

  Also, notice that on the left side of
  $ \dx{A}=\dx(\pi r^2) = 2\pi r \dx{r}$ we have the infinitesimal
  quantity, $\dx{A}$.  Since the two sides of the equation are equal
  it follows that the quantity on the right side is also an
  infinitesimal. The obvious conclusion is that the ordinary real
  number $2\pi r$ multiplied by the infinitesimal $\dx{r}$ must result
  in an infinitesimal quantity. Dividing both sides by $\d{r}$ we have
  $\dfdx{A}{r}=2\pi r$, which seems to indicate that the quotient of
  two differentials will be an ordinary real number. Does this make
  intuitive sense to you?
  
  Notice that we asked if it makes \emph{intuitive} sense. When
  working with differentials it frequently happens that a statement
  feels right (makes intuitive sense) but begins to fall apart when
  examined more carefully.% For example, what does it
      % even mean to multiply a number and a differential?

Let's try out our differentiation rules on a relatively simple
example. We will include every single step so that you can see how the
differentiation rules are used in concert.

  From the Sum Rule we have,
  \begin{align*}
    \dx\left(5x^6-3x^4+21x^2-7\right)
    \amp{}=\dx\left(5x^6\right)-\dx\left(3x^4\right)+\dx\left(21x^2\right)-\dx(7).\\
    \intertext{Next, Constant Rule, and  the Constant Multiple Rule give,}
    \amp{}=
    5\dx\left(x^6\right)-3\dx\left(x^4\right)+21\dx\left(x^2\right)-0,
    \intertext{and by the Power Rule for Positive Integers we have,}
    \amp{}=
    5\left(6x^5\dx{x}\right)-3\left(4x^3\dx{x}\right)+21\left(2x^1\dx{x}\right)\\
    \amp{}=30x^5\dx{x}-12x^3\dx{x}+42x\dx{x}.\\
    \intertext{Finally, factoring out the differential of $x$ gives,}
    \dx\left(5x^6-3x^4+21x^2-7\right)\amp{}=\left(30x^5-12x^3+42x\right)\dx{x}.
  \end{align*}
  Did you notice that the differential $\dx{x}$ appeared in every term
  allowing us to factor it out at the end? When there is only one
  independent variable involved ($x$ in this case) that will
  \emph{always} happen. So it provides an easy way to check your
  computations.

  If you end with an expression where the differential of the
  independent variable cannot be factored out then you have made a
  mistake in your computations.  You should find your mistake before
  going on. Or just begin again.
  % because you've made a mistake.  % Often it is quicker to just repeat the calculation. But

As you become more skilled you will probably do many of the steps from
Example~\ref{examp:DiffRulesInConcert1} in your head.  But for now,
notice how the rules work together and are applied as they are needed.

\begin{myexample}
  \label{examp:DiffRulesInConcert2}
  Here is another example without all the details spelled out.
  Make sure you see which rule is being invoked at each step.
  \begin{align*}
    \dx(\textcolor{red}{(2x+5)}\textcolor{blue}{(3x-7)})\amp{}=\textcolor{red}{(2x+5)}\textcolor{blue}{\dx(3x-7)}+\textcolor{blue}{(3x-7)}\textcolor{red}{\dx(2x+5)}\\
    \amp{}=\textcolor{red}{(2x+5)}(3)\dx{x}+\textcolor{blue}{(3x-7)}(2)\dx{x}\\
    \amp{}=(6x+15+6x-14)\dx{x}\\
    \amp{}=(12x+1)\dx{x}.
  \end{align*}
\end{myexample}

Of course, in  Example~\ref{examp:DiffRulesInConcert2} we could have multiplied the
factors together before differentiating and obtained the same
answer:
\begin{align*}
  \dx((2x+5)(3x-7)) \amp{}= \dx(6x^2+x-35)\\
  \amp{}= 6(2x\dx{x})+\dx{x}-0\\
  \amp{}= (12x+1)\dx{x}.
\end{align*}
% $$
% \dx((2x+5)(3x-7))=\dx(6x^2+x-35)=6(2x\dx{x})+\dx{x}-0=(12x+1)\dx{x}.

Either procedure will work. You are at liberty to do whichever you

  Differentiating both sides of an ordinary algebraic equation
  yields a \term{Differential Equation} -- an equation which
  relates the differentials of the quantities involved.
  For example, suppose we have a point $(x,y)$ lying on the unit
  circle so that the quantities $x$ and $y$ are related by the
  equation $ x^2+y^2=1$.

  Differentiating, we have the differential equation
  \begin{align}
    \nonumber    2x\dx{x}+2y\dx{y}\amp{}=0 \text{ or }\\
    y\dx{y}\amp{}=-x\dx{x}.\label{eq:UnitCircleDiff}
  \end{align}

  Let's look at this geometrically and focus on the first quadrant.
  The sketch at the left shows what happens to the quantities $x$ and
  $y$ as the point changes its position on the circle.

  The smaller triangle is called a \term{differential
    triangle}\aside{Because all three sides are differentials,
    obviously.}  and it is infinitely small. Differential triangles
  were a favorite tool of Leibniz. He assumed without justification
  (as we will, for now) that they are just like ordinary (finite)
  triangles.

  Notice that $\dx{x}$ is negative since the $x$ coordinate is moving
  to the left, and that $\dx{y}$ is positive since the $y$ coordinate
  is moving upward. We need positive quantities to represent the
  length of the triangle's legs. Therefore we use $-\dx{x}$ to represent a
  positive length for the horizontal leg of our differential triangle.

  A little more mysterious is the (correct) observation that the
  smaller triangle isn't really a triangle at all. Because it is
  part of the circle the
  line connecting $(x,y)$ and $(x+\dx{x}, y+\dx{y})$ -- the hypotenuse
  of the triangle -- is curved.
  But there is
  nothing lost by thinking of the  hypotenuse as  a straight line
  because according to the Principle of Local Linearity at an infinitely
  small scale lines and curves are indistinguishable.
  % But, just as Newton,
  % Leibniz, and their contemporaries did, when lengths are
  % infinitesimal, we will assume that there is no distinction between a
  % curve and a straight line.
  % It is not at all obvious here but this is closely related tho the
  % issue we encountered when we ignored the term $\d{x}\d{y}$ in our
  % development of the the Product Rule.  The fancy, technical term for
  % this is  \alert{The Principle of Local Linearity}. On
  % an infinitely small scale, we do not distinguish between a curve and
  % its tangent line\aside{Alternatively, we can say that every curve is
  % made up of infinitely many, infinitely small straight line
  % segments. A happy consequence of this way of thinking is that we
  % can think of the line tangent to a curve at a given point as just
  % the differential at that point, extended to the finite scale.}.
  % This is what Leibniz was getting at when he said that curves consist
  % of infinitely small line segments. It is,
  At least in part, this why Newton, Leibniz, and their contemporaries
  worked with differentials. At that scale they could replace curves
  with straight lines.  % A little further on we will state the
  % Principle of Local Linearity formally.

\begin{myexample}[Brute Force Computation]
  \label{example:BruteForce}
  Suppose and we wish to find $\dx{y}$ when $y=5(x^2+x)^3$ One way to
  do this is simple brute force. That is, we compute
  \begin{align*}
    y=5\textcolor{red}{(x^2+x)^3} \amp{}= 5\textcolor{red}{(x^6+3x^5+3x^4+x^3)}
    = 5x^6+15x^5+15x^4+5x^3.
    \intertext{Applying the Sum Rule we see that}
    \dx y \amp{}= \dx \left(5x^6\right)+\dx \left(15x^5\right)+\dx
    \left(15x^4\right)+\dx \left(5x^3\right).
    \intertext{Next we use the
    Constant Multiple
    Rule, to get}
    \dx y \amp{}= 5\dx \left(x^6\right)+15\dx \left(x^5\right)+15\dx
    \left(x^4\right)+5\dx \left(x^3\right).
    \intertext{Finally, we use the Power Rule four times
    to get}
    \dx y \amp{}= 30x^5\dx x+75x^4\dx x+60x^3\dx x+15x^2\dx x.\\
    \dx y \amp{}= (30x^5+75x^4+60x^3+15x^2)\dx x.
  \end{align*}
  In the end we have,
  $$
  \dx{y}= (30x^5+75x^4+60x^3+15 x^2)\dx{x}.
  $$
  
  Brute force works but expanding an expression like
  $(x^2+x)^3$ is dull (and error prone) and 
  mathematicians are like Nature: We are lazy.  We'd really
  rather avoid doing all of that dull computation if we
  possibly can. Wouldn't you?

  Suppose, we make this problem a little ``easier on the
  eyes'' with a substitution like we did in Section~\ref{sec:an-easy-problem-alg}.
  Let $z=x^2+x$.  Then our original
  problem becomes $ y=5z^3$ which is much easier to look
  at. And now $\dx{y}=15z^2\dx{z}$.  Substituting $x^2+x$ back
  in for $z$ we get
  $\dx y = 15(x^2+x)^2\dx (x^2+x).$
  After computing $\dx (x^2+x) = (2x+1)\dx x$ we see that
  \[\dx y = 15(x^2+x)^2(2x+1)\dx x.\]

\begin{myexample}[Making Things ``Easier on the Eyes'']
  \label{example:EOE1}
  Suppose we wish to find $\dx{y}$ when $y=(x+2)^2(2x-3)^3$
  Once again we {could} just apply brute force by
  multiplying out the expression $(x+2)^2(2x-3)^3.$ But this is
  a lot of work and it is very error prone.

  Instead notice that $y$ is the \emph{product} of
  $(x+2)^2$ and $(2x-3)^3,$ so the Product Rule seems a likely
  place to begin. But first we make it ``easier on the eyes''
  with the substitutions, $z=x+2$, and $w=2x-3$. Thus:
  \begin{align*}
    y\amp{}=\textcolor{red}{(\underbrace{x+2}_{=z})^2}\textcolor{blue}{(\underbrace{2x-3}_{=w})^3}\\
    y\amp{}=\textcolor{red}{z^2}\textcolor{blue}{w^3}.\\
    \intertext{Using the Product Rule we now have}
    \dx y \amp{}= \textcolor{red}{z^2}\textcolor{blue}{\dx(w^3)} +
    \textcolor{blue}{w^3}\textcolor{red}{\dx(z^2)}\\
    \amp{}= (x+2)^2\textcolor{blue}{{\dx(w^3)}} +
    (2x-3)^3\textcolor{red}{{\dx(z^2)}}\\
    \amp{}=
    (x+2)^2\textcolor{blue}{(3w^2)\d{w}}+(2x-3)^3\textcolor{red}{(2z)\d{z}}\\
    \amp{}= (x+2)^2(3)(2x-3)^2\textcolor{blue}{{\dx(2x-3)}} + (2x-3)^3(2)(x+2)\textcolor{red}{{\dx(x+2)}}\\
    \amp{}= (x+2)^2(3)(2x-3)^2(2)\dx x + (2x-3)^3(2)(x+2)\dx{x}.\\
    % \intertext{Factoring out the $\dx{x}$ gives}
    \intertext{and so }
    \dx{y} \amp{}= \left[6(x+2)^2(2x-3)^2 + 2(2x-3)^3(x+2)\right]\dx{x}.
  \end{align*}
  Not only does this involve considerably less Algebra (and is
  thus less prone to error) it also gives us $\dx{y}$ in a
  form that is easy to factor. This is important because, as we
  mentioned in our comment to
  Problem~\#\ref{problem:BruteForce}, many of the problems to
  come will involve finding a differential, setting it equal to
  zero, and then solving the resulting equation.  If we had computed
  this by brute force we would have to find the roots of a fully
  expanded fourth degree polynomial. That would be hard.  The
  form given above is much easier to work with. Let's go ahead
  and set $\dx{y}=0$ and solve the resulting equation:
  $$
  6\textcolor{red}{(x+2)}^2\textcolor{blue}{(2x-3)}^2 +
  2\textcolor{blue}{(2x-3)}^3\textcolor{red}{(x+2)} = 0.
  $$
  just for practice.

  The prospects for solving the equation, even in this form
  seem pretty glum at first, but it really isn't so bad once
  we notice that $\textcolor{red}{(x+2)}$ and
  $\textcolor{blue}{(2x-3)^2}$ appear as factors in both
  terms on the left hand side.  Factoring these out
  gives

  \begin{align}
    \nonumber                                                              \textcolor{red}{(x+2)}\textcolor{blue}{(2x-3)^2}\left[6\textcolor{red}{(x+2)}+2\textcolor{blue}{(2x-3)}\right] \amp{}= 0
    \intertext{so that}
    \nonumber             \textcolor{red}{(x+2)}\textcolor{blue}{(2x-3)^2}\left[6x+12+4x-6)\right] \amp{}= 0\\
    \label{eq:EOE1}          2(x+2)(2x-3)^2(5x+3) \amp{}= 0.
  \end{align}

  Compute the differential of $y=(x^2-4)^3(x^2+3)^5$ and solve

\end{ProficiencyDrill-1line}

As you become more comfortable using these differentiation rules
together, you will probably do many of the steps in a long
differentiation more informally, perhaps even in your head. However,
most of the time differentiation will only be one part of much larger
problems. If you don't differentiate correctly whatever you do after
that is wasted time and effort. It is better to proceed slowly to be
sure you are right. If it helps to write out each step in detail then
you should certainly do that.


At this point we can find the differentials of a large number of
algebraic expressions. But not all. For example suppose
$y=\sqrt{x}.$ Nothing we've done so far tells us what $\dx{y}$ is.

\begin{myexample}
  \label{example:PowRuleExtension1}
  However, you are surely aware that the radical symbol,
  $\sqrt{\phantom{4} }$,
  can be expressed as a fractional exponent. For example,
  $\sqrt{x} =x^{\frac12}.$ It is tempting to simply assert that, by
  the Power Rule,
  $\dx(x^{1/2}) = \frac12\cdot x^{1/2-1}\dx{x} =
  \frac12\cdot\frac{1}{x^{1/2}}\dx{x} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2x}}\dx{x}.$ In
  fact this is true, but it doesn't follow from the way we developed the
  Power Rule because we depended quite explicitly on the
  assumption that the exponent of $x^n$ is a positive integer.

  Here's one way to prove that the Power Rule works when $n=1/2$. If
  $y=\sqrt{x}$ then $y^2=x.$ Computing the differential of both sides
  gives:
  \begin{align*}
    \dx(y^2)\amp{}=\dx x\\
    2y \dx{y}\amp{}=\dx x\\
    \dx{y}\amp{}=\frac{1}{2y} \dx x=\frac{1}{2x^{1/2}} \dx x=\frac{1}{2}\cdot\frac{1}{x^{1/2}} \dx{x}\\
  \end{align*}
  or $ \dx{y} =\frac{1}{2}{x^{1/2-1}} \dx{x}$ which is the Power Rule
  with $n=\frac12$.
\end{myexample}

% \begin{embeddedproblem}{}
%   Verify that this matches what we obtained using Descartes' Method of
%   Normals in Example~\ref{ex:DescartesNormal1}.
% \end{embeddedproblem}

This example is more important than it appears to be. What it shows
is that the Power Rule can be extended to include at least the case
where the exponent is $1/2$.  In fact, the Power Rule is easily
extended to allow the exponent to be any positive fraction, say
$2/3$ for example.

\begin{myexample}
  \label{example:PowRuleExtension2}
  You should be a little bit surprised at this. After all,
  $y=x^{2/3}$ is a complicated thing, compared to $y=x^2$, or even
  $y=x^{1/3}$.  Nevertheless, essentially the same procedure works
  here too.  If $ y=x^{2/3}$, then $ y^3=x^2$.  Differentiating both
  sides gives
  $$ 3y^2\dx{y}=2x\dx{x}$$
  and solving for $\dx{y}$ leaves us with
  $$\dx{y}=\frac23 \frac{x}{y^2}\dx{x}.$$
  This is not yet recognizable as the Power Rule primarily because we
  need to express the right side entirely in terms of $x$. But recall that
  $y=x^{2/3}$ so that $y^2=x^{4/3}$. Making that substitution gives
  $$ \dx{y} = \frac23\frac{x}{x^{4/3}\dx{x}}= \frac23
  x^{-\frac{1}{3}}\dx{x}= \frac23 x^{\frac{2}{3}-1}\dx{x}$$ which is
  the Power Rule with $n=2/3.$
\end{myexample}

\begin{embeddedproblem-enumerate}[The Power Rule for Positive, Rational Numbers]
  \label{EP:PRPosRat}
  \begin{enumerate}[label={\bf{}(\alph*)}]
  \item Mimic the process in Examples~\ref{example:PowRuleExtension1}
    and~\ref{example:PowRuleExtension2} to show that
    $\dx\left(\sqrt[3]{x^4}\right)=\frac43x^{\frac13}\dx{x}.$
  \item Now suppose $y=x^{\frac{p}{q}},$ where $p$ and $q$ are
    positive integers and show that
    $\dx\left( x^{\frac{p}{q}}\right)=\frac{p}{q} x^{\frac{p}{q}-1}
    \dx x.$
  \end{enumerate}
  
\end{embeddedproblem-enumerate}

\begin{myexample}
  \label{example:PowRuleExtension3}
  Having seen that the Power Rule can be extended to include positive,
  fractional exponents it is natural to ask if it can be extended
  to negative exponents  Can we find
  the differential of $y=1/x = \inverse{x}.$

  Of course we can.

  If $y=1/x$ then $xy=1.$ By the Product Rule we have
  \begin{align*}
    \dx(xy)=\dx(1)\\
    x\dx{y}+y\dx{x}\amp{}=0\\
    x\dx{y}\amp{}=-y\dx{x}\\
    \dx{y}\amp{}=-\frac{\textcolor{red}{y}}{x}\dx{x}=-\frac{\textcolor{red}{\frac1x}}{x}\dx{x}\\
    \amp=-\frac{1}{x^2}\dx{x}\\
    \intertext{and thus}
    \dx{y} \amp{}= \d{\left(\inverse{x}\right)}  =(-1)x^{(-1)-1}\dx{x}. 
  \end{align*}
  So the Power Rule works for $n=-1$ as well.
\end{myexample}
% \pagebreak[4]


\begin{embeddedproblem}{}
  \label{EP:PRRecip}{}
  Let $r$ be a positive rational number and  $y=x^{-r}=1/x^r$. As in
  Example~\#\ref{example:PowRuleExtension3} clear the fraction and use
  the Product Rule to obtain the Power Rule for negative rational
  numbers:
  $$\dx  y=-rx^{-r-1} \dx x.$$
\end{embeddedproblem}


\begin{ProficiencyDrill}
  Use the formula you found in Problem\#\ref{EP:PRRecip} to show that
  $\dx\left(\frac{1}{\sqrt[3]{x^4}}\right)=-\frac43x^{-\frac73}\dx{x}.$
\end{ProficiencyDrill}

Thus we see that the Power Rule holds for any rational number,
positive or negative, which gives us the following.

\noindent\term{\underline{The Power  Rule for Rational Numbers}:} Let
$p,$ and $q$ be any integers, positive or negative, with $q\neq0$. Then
$\dx\left(x^{\frac{p}{q}}\right)=\frac{p}{q}x^{\frac{p}{q}-1}\dx{x}$.


We can now differentiate some pretty complicated
expressions. Frequently an appropriate substitution will make this
``easier on the eyes''  but otherwise at each step  only need
to invoke one of the General Differentiation Rules. When the expression is
complicated the key is to be methodical and do one step at a time
even if you are doing some of them in your head.

\begin{myexample}
  \label{example:ComplexDifferentiation1}
  To differentiate
  $\left(
    \sqrt{x^2-2}
  \right)
  \left(
    \sqrt{x}-2\right)$
  we begin by re-expressing the radicals as exponents because we have
  no differentiation rules for radicals.
  \begin{align*}
    \dx\left[{\left(\textcolor{red}{\sqrt{x^2-2}}\right)\left(\textcolor{blue}{\sqrt{x}-2}\right)}\right] \amp{}=
    \dx\left[\left(\textcolor{red}{(x^2-2)^{1/2}}\right)\left(\textcolor{blue}{x^{1/2}-2}\right)\right]\\
    \amp{}=
    (x^2-2)^{\frac12}\textcolor{blue}{\dx{\left(x^{\frac12}-2\right)}}+\left(x^{\frac12}-2\right)\textcolor{red}{\dx{(x^2-2)^{\frac12}}}\\

In most of Drill~\#\ref{drill:spacetime} $y$ is given explicitly in
terms of $x$. But in part (j) $y$ is given implicitly. We've seen
this before.  Almost everyone's first impulse in this situation is
to try to solve this for $y$ explicitly and then differentiate, but
(a) it isn't necessary, (b) it isn't always possible, and (c) even
when it is possible it is often harder that simply differentiating
the formula we're given.  Our differentiation rules remain
unchanged. After completing the differentiation we simply need to
solve for $\dx{y}$.

\begin{myexample}
  For example, how can we compute $\dx{y}$ given that
  \begin{equation}
    2x^2-xy+z^3y^2 = 1+y?
    \label{eq:QuadImpl}
  \end{equation}
  It is possible to solve this explicitly for $y$ but it is
  difficult and the complexity of the computations tends to hide
  the underlying simplicity of the larger problem. Since
  Equation~(\ref{eq:QuadImpl}) is quadratic in $y$ (the highest
  power of $y$ is $2$) we need only use the Quadratic Formula to
  get $y$ explicitly in terms of $x$ and $z$ and then differentiate. Try
  that some time when you have time to kill. Lots of time.

  Instead, we'll just apply our differentiation rules to
  Equation~(\ref{eq:QuadImpl}) as it is. Differentiating we have
  \begin{equation}
    4x\dx{x}-(x\textcolor{red}{\dx{y}}+y\dx{x})+\left(z^3(2y\textcolor{red}{\dx{y}})+y^2(3z^2\dx{z})\right)=\textcolor{red}{\dx{y}}.
    \label{eq:QuadImplDiff}
  \end{equation}
  At first this may look very difficult to solve for $\dx{y}$ but
  look again. This differential equation is actually linear in each
  of the differentials, $\dx{x}$, $\d{y}$, and $\d{z}$. That is,
  each differential only appears raised to the first power. This
  will always happen. When we differentiate any expression the
  result will always be linear in the differentials involved.

  We can rearrange our equation algebraically so that it has the
  following form.
  $$
  (\text{stuff})\dx{y} = (\text{more stuff})\dx{x} + (\text{even
    more stuff})\dx{z}.
  $$
  Solving for $\dx{y}$ gives
  $$
  \dx{y} = \frac{(\text{more stuff})\dx{x} + (\text{even
      more stuff})\dx{z}}{(\text{stuff})}.
  $$
  
  For this example the specific computations are:
  \begin{align*}
    4x\dx{x}-x\textcolor{red}{\dx{y}}-y\dx{x} +
    2yz^3\textcolor{red}{\dx{y}}+3y^2z^2\dx{z}\amp=\textcolor{red}{\dx{y}}\\
    2yz^3\textcolor{red}{\dx{y}}-x\textcolor{red}{\dx{y}}-\textcolor{red}{\dx{y}}
    \amp=y\dx{x}-4x\dx{x}-3y^2z^2\dx{z}\\
    (2yz^3-x-1)\dx{y}\amp=(y-4x)\dx{x} - 2y^2z^2\dx{z}\\
    \dx{y}\amp=\frac{(y-4x)\dx{x} - 2y^2z^2\dx{z}}{2yz^3-x-1}.
  \end{align*}

  At this point we have solved our problem so we needn’t do any
  more. But notice that we could also write this as
  $$
  \dx{y}=\frac{(y-4x)}{2yz^3-x-1}\dx{x} -
  \frac{2y^2z^2}{2yz^3-x-1}\dx{z} 
  $$.

  Some problems are legitimately hard, and some only look hard.
  So remember that as bleak as things may look sometimes, you
  should always keep your goal in view. In this case we were
  trying to isolate $\dx{y}$, so we gathered all of the terms that
  had $\dx{y}$ in them, put all the other terms on the other side
  of the equation, factored out the $\d{y}$ and divided by the
  ``stuff'' that formed the coefficient of $\d{y}$.  This process
  is often easier than trying to solve for $y$ before
  differentiating.

    $\dx{z}$.

\subsubsection*{The General Power Rule}
It the title of his $1684$ paper Leibniz claimed that his
\foreign{Calculus Differentialis} was 
\pubtitle{``\ellipsis{}  Impeded Neither by
  Fractional nor Irrational Quantities, \ellipsis''.}
But notice that nothing we've done so far allows us to differentiate, say
$y=x^{\sqrt{2}}$, since $\sqrt{2}$ is irrational and  cannot be represented as a
fraction. Having an irrational exponent is a bigger problem than it
seems to be.

Take a moment 
and ask yourself what an expression like $x^{\sqrt{2}}$ could even
mean.

\begin{center}
  \begin{minipage}{.85\linewidth}
    \noindent{}No! No! No! Wait!

    \noindent{}Don't keep reading. We're serious. Take a moment and
    think about this.  How do you multiply $\sqrt{2}$ copies of $x$
    together? Does that even mean anything? If so, what?
  \end{minipage}
\end{center}
We clearly have no way (so far) to interpret the meaning of an
expression like $x^{\sqrt{2}}$.  So trying to find its differential
using the techniques we have is hopeless.  In
Chapter~\ref{cha:last-elem-funct} we will find\aside{Actually, we will
  invent it. Meaning is not something we find, it is something we
  create.} a way to give meaning to $x^{\sqrt{2}}$ and other such
expressions. When we do we will find that the Power Rule still
works. In the meantime, \emph{for now} we will assume \emph{for now}
that the Power Rule always works, even when the exponent is
irrational.

\vskip2mm{}
\noindent\term{\underline{The General Power  Rule}:} Let
$\alpha$ be any real number. Then
$\dx(x^{\alpha})=\alpha x^{\alpha-1}\dx{x}$.
\vskip2mm{}

% But we have not yet shown that this is true for irrational values of
% $\alpha$. Until we do this assumption is suspect.
% That is, we'll be giving this meaning
% in a manner that guarantees that the Power Rule will work here too, so
% until then we will just assume that the Power Rule also works when the
% exponent is irrational so you can get some practice with it.

%     \end{multicols}

\begin{myexample}
  \label{example:QR1}
  Suppose we wish to 
  find $\d{y}$ when 
  $y= \frac{2-3x^2}{\sqrt{x}}$.  Rewriting this slightly we have   $y=
  \frac{2-3x^2}{\sqrt{x}} = x^{\frac12}\left(2-3x^2\right) =
  2x^{-\frac12}-3x^{\frac32}$.  From the General
  Differentiation Rules we have:
  \begin{equation*}
    \begin{split}
      \d{y}=\dx\left(\frac{2-3x^2}{x^{\frac12}}\right)
      \amp{}
      =\dx\left(2x^{-\frac12}-3x^{\frac32}\right)\\
      \amp{}
      =\left[2\left(-\frac12x^{-\frac32}\dx{x}\right)-3\left(\frac32x^{\frac12}\dx{x}\right)\right]
      =\left(-x^{-\frac32}-\frac92x^{\frac12}\right)\d{x}.
    \end{split}
  \end{equation*}

  Now suppose we have $z=1/y=\frac{\sqrt{x}}{2-3x^2}$.  Can we
  compute\aside{Be sure you see why the previous approach won't work.}:
  $\d{z}$?

  There are actually two different approaches to this problem that use
  the Product Rule.  The first is to rewrite $z$ as
  $x^{\frac12}\inverse{(2-3x^2)}$ then apply the Product Rule followed
  by the Power Rule.

  The second approach is to clear the fraction so that
  $z(2-3x^2)=\sqrt{x}$.  From here we can compute the differential of
  both sides (using the Product Rule on the left side) and solve the
  result for $\d{z}.$

  \begin{embeddedproblem}
    \label{problem:QR1}
    Compute $\d\left(\frac{\sqrt{x}}{2-3x^2}\right)$ by each of the two
    methods indicated in Example~\#\ref{example:QR1}. Verify that your
    results are equivalent either way.
  \end{embeddedproblem}
\end{myexample}

Both of the techniques in Example~\#\ref{example:QR1} are
straightforward and can be applied to any fractional
expression. Because this can become a bit cumbersome we will calculate
$\d\left(\frac{x}{y}\right)$ once and for all. This will give us a
convenient shortcut to handle fractional expressions called the
Quotient Rule.

    and applying the Product Rule.
  \item By making the substitution $z=\frac{x}{y}$, so that
    $yz=x$. Apply the Product Rule and solve for $\dx{z}$.
  \end{enumerate}
\end{embeddedproblem}

Applying the Quotient Rule directly to  Problem~\ref{problem:QR1} we have
\begin{align*}
  \dx\left(\frac{\textcolor{blue}{\sqrt{x}}}{\textcolor{red}{2-3x^2}}\right) \amp{}=\frac{(\textcolor{red}{2-3x^2})\dx\left(\textcolor{blue}{x^{1/2}}\right)-\textcolor{blue}{x^{1/2}} \dx(\textcolor{red}{2-3x^2})}{(\textcolor{red}{2-3x^2})^2} \\

\noindent{}We now have all six of the General Differentiation Rules in our toolbox:
\begin{description}
\item[The Constant Rule:] If $a$ is a constant, then $\dx{a}=0.$
\item[The Sum Rule:] $\dx(x+y)=\dx x+\dx y.$
\item[The Constant Multiple Rule:] If $a$ is a constant, then $\dx(ax)=a\dx x.$
\item[The Product Rule:] $\dx{(xy)}=x\dx{y}+y\dx{x}.$
\item[The Power Rule:] If $n$ is any real number then, $\dx(x^n)=nx^{n-1}\dx{x}$.
\item[The Quotient Rule:] $\dx{\left(\dfrac{x}{y}\right)}=\dfrac{y\dx{x}-x\dx{y}}{y^2}.$
\end{description}
We have not yet shown that the Power Rule works when $n$ is
irrational but we will do that in
Chapter~\ref{cha:last-elem-funct}. So we have stated the full
version here.

Of these, the Constant Multiple Rule, the Power Rule and the
Quotient Rule are really just conveniences. They can all be derived
from the other three.

We remind you that the General Differentiation Rules only tell you
how to compute differentials. They do not tell you what
differentials you need to compute or why.  Algebra, Geometry,
Arithmetic, and Trigonometry are still important tools as
well. Tools are only useful if you are skillful with them, and can
use them in a coordinated fashion. This requires practice. Lots of
practice.
