<title>Introduction</title>


<!-- \label{sec:introduction} -->

<p>
While it would not be correct to say that Calculus was invented solely
to solve optimization problems, it's pretty close\aside{Once it was
  invented, of course, Calculus turned out to be a very useful tool
  for lots of other problems as well.}. Recall that one of the
fundamental tenets of modern science is that nature is lazy. Light
follows the fastest (minimal) path between two points. Soap bubbles
are spherical because that is the shape that encloses the most
(maximal) volume for a given surface area. Alternatively, a soap
bubble uses the least (minimal) surface area to enclose a particular
volume\aside{Actually, a physicist would say that soap bubbles are
  spherical because that is the shape the minimizes the potential
  energy contained in the soap film. It all comes to the same
  end. Something must be optimized.}. Nature optimizes.
</p>
<p>


Mathematically speaking all optimization starts in the same place: We
have some quantity (revenue, tax liability, temperature, resource
consumption, travel time, potential energy, volume, surface area,
whatever), which depends on one or more variables. The variables are
(usually) constrained in some way, and we need to find conditions that
make the quantity as large, or as small as possible within those
constraints.  The ``thing to be optimized'' is called the
<term>objective function</term> and the constraints on the variables are
called .\ .\ .\ well, they're called the <term>constraints</term>.
</p>
<p>

When we looked at Fermat's Method of Adequality in
<xref ref="SECferm-meth-aedeq">Section</xref> we observed that if <m>f(x)</m> is a
(continuous) function then near an optimal point <m>f(x+h)\approx f(x)</m>
as long as <m>h</m> is not too big.  Loosely speaking, this says that near
an extremum the graph of the function is practically horizontal. More
formally we have:
</p>

<theorem xml:id="thm:FermatsTheorem">
<title>Fermat's Theorem</title>
  <!-- <!-\- <!-\\- \label{thm:FermatsTheorem} -\\-> -\-> -->
<p>
  If a function, <m>f(x)</m>, is differentiable at <m>x=a</m> and
  <m>f(a)</m> is either a maximum or a minimum then
  <m>\eval{\dfdx{f}{x}}{x}{a}=0</m>.
</p>
</theorem>

<p>
In view of Fermat's Theorem it appears that a likely strategy for
attacking optimization problems is to find an expression, say <m>f(x)</m>,
for the objective function and then solve the equation
<m>\dfdx{f}{x} = 0</m>. In fact, this is precisely the strategy we used in
<xref ref="SECrates-change">Section</xref> to find the maximal height attained by
a tossed ball. If we toss a ball upward we know that it will reach a
maximal height.  At the top of its flight, when the ball transitions
from upward movement to downward movement, there is a moment when its
velocity is zero. Thus we saw that if <m>p(t)</m> is a formula that gives
the height of the ball at any time, setting <m> \dfdx{p}{t}=0</m> and
solving for <m>t</m> will yield the time when the ball is at the top of its
flight.
</p>

<exercise xml:id="no-label">
<statement>
<p>
  Suppose a ball is tossed vertically from the surface of the earth
  with an initial velocity of <m>20
  \frac{\text{meters}}{\text{sec}}</m>. Show that the ball reaches its

  height when <m>t=\frac{20}{9.8}\approx 2</m> seconds.\\
  \hint{You may want to review
    <xref ref="PROBLEMGeneralFallingBalls">Problem~\</xref>}
</p>
</statement>
</exercise>

<p>
At their simplest, optimization problems really are just that
straightforward. But ``straightforward'' does not necessarily mean
easy. There are several nuances that, if not clearly understood, can
cause much confusion and difficulty. We will proceed carefully.
</p>

<p>
To begin, take careful note of what Fermat's Theorem says and, just as
important, what it does not say: It says that if <m>(a, f(a))</m> is a
point on the graph of a differentiable function <m>f(x)</m>, and if <m>f(a)</m>
is known to be an extremum (either a maximum or a minimum) then
<m>\eval{\dfdx{f}{x}}{x}{a}=0</m>.
</p>

<p>
Fermat's Theorem does not say that if <m>\eval{\dfdx{f}{x}}{x}{a}=0</m>
then <m>f(a)</m> must be an extremum. In fact, that is not necessarily
true.  For example, if <m>f(x)=x^3</m> then <m>\eval{\dfdx{f}{x}}{x}{0}=0</m>
but the graph has neither a maximum or a minimum at <m>(0, f(0))</m>.
Confirm this by graphing it.
</p>

<p>
We have a lifetime of experience with tossed balls telling us
that a tossed ball will reach a maximum height.  Fermat's Theorem tells us
that whenever that maximum height is attained, <m>\dfdx{p}{t}</m> will be
zero. So all we had to do for this problem is find the one and only
time when <m>\dfdx{p}{t}=0</m>. This is the time when the maximum height is
reached.
But suppose after the ball is released there are forces other than gravity  involved.  Suppose,
for example, that our tossed ball is being buffeted by the wind on a
blustery day is such a way that the height of the ball is given by
<me>
p(t)=(t-1)^4+(t-1)^3+5.
</me>
We  have no experience, hence no intuition, with a ball moving in
this fashion so we have no way to decide if there even is a maximum,
let alone what it might be.  We also have no tools to help us find the
maximum height of the ball if it does exist.  Fermat's Theorem doesn't help because it
tells us what happens at an extremum <m>\left(\dfdx{p}{t}=0\right)</m>, not
how to find it.  In this chapter we will build up some tools to help
us find extrema.

<title>Preliminaries: Some Simple Optimizations</title>

<p>


To begin we will consider problems that will allow us to use our
intuition. Our goal is to build a set of tools. By the end of this
chapter we will be able to rely more on the tools of Calculus and less
on intuition to solve a wide variety of optimization problems. This
does not mean that you should stop using your intuition, only that you
will have a set of tools that will allow you to either confirm your
instincts, or refute them.
</p>
<p>



Many of the examples in this section can be solved by more elementary
methods than Calculus. If you can see a more fundamental way to solve
these problems and examples, that's great!  Do that. But keep the goal
in mind. We're interested in these examples as a means to elucidate
the subtleties inherent in optimization problems. These problems are a
means to that end, not an end in themselves.

<example xml:id="example:SqOnLine">
<title>Constructing A Square on a Line</title>
<p>
  <!-- \label{example:SqOnLine} -->
  What is the area of the smallest possible square having one corner
  at the point $(2,3)$ and an adjacent corner on the line
  <me>
    5x+3y=2.\label{eq:SqOptConst}

<!--     \label{fig:LineDist1} -->
<!--   \end{wrapfigure} -->
<p>

  The diagram at the right is a visualization of this problem. We can
  imagine the blue square growing and shrinking as we move the point
  $(a,b)$ along the line. It seems clear that the square having the least
  area is the one pictured in black (when $(a,b)$ is at $(x,y)$. It is
  worth taking a moment to notice this explicitly because not all
  optimization problems are solvable. If we had asked for the largest
  possible square there would be no solution because the blue square
  in our diagram can always be make larger by moving the point $(a,b)$
  further to the left on the graph of <xref ref="EQSqOptConst">Equation~</xref>).
</p>
<p>

  But a convincing picture is not a solution. To complete the solution
  we'll need to compute the coordinates of the point $(x,y)$ in our
  sketch and compute the minimal area.
</p>
<p>
  
  In any optimization problem the first question to ask is, ``What do
  we need to optimize?'' In other words, ``What is our objective
  function?''  For this problem the length of the line segment between
  the point $(2,3)$ and any point $(x,y)$ is given by the
  Distance Formula: $\sqrt{(x-2)^2+(y-3)^2}$.  Therefore the area of
  the square constructed from this line segment is given by the
  function:
  $$
  A(x)=\left(\sqrt{(x-2)^2+(y-3)^2}\right)^2=(x-2)^2+(y-3)^2.
  $$
  So our objective function is $A(x)$.
  Since the point $(x,y)$ is constrained to lie on the line
  $ 5x+3y=2$, <xref ref="EQSqOptConst">Equation~</xref>), is our constraint.
</p>
<p>

  Notice that we've abused our notation a bit. Although the notation
  $A(x)$ indicates that $A$ depends on $x$ alone, we've given $A$ in
  terms of both $x$ and $y$. But solving
  <xref ref="EQSqOptConst">Equation~</xref>) gives\aside{If we make this
    substitution immediately we can get the objective function solely
    in terms of $x$: $A(x)=(x-2)^2+\left(\frac13(2-5x)-3\right)^2$,
    But does that really help? Either way we're going to have to
    differentiate $A(x)$. Which form of $A(x)$ would you rather use?
    We think using two variables makes this objective function a bit
    ``easier on the eyes.''  } $y=\frac13(2-5x)$ so it should be clear
  that $A$ really depends only on $x$.
</p>
<p>
  
  We've seen visually that this problem has a solution and Fermat's
  Theorem tells us that the derivative of our objective function will
  be zero at that solution.  So we differentiate both sides of
  \begin{align*}
    A\amp =(x-2)^2+(y-3)^2\\
    \intertext{which gives}
    \dx{A}\amp =2(x-2)\dx{x} + 2(y-3)\textcolor{red}{\dx{y}}.
    \intertext{
    But recall that $x$ and $y$ are constrained by the
    <xref ref="EQSqOptConst">Equation~</xref>) from which we see that
    $\textcolor{red}{\dx{y}= -\frac{5}{3}\dx{x}}$.  Therefore
    }
    \dx{A}\amp = 2(x-2)\dx{x} +
    2(y-3)\left(\textcolor{red}{-\frac{5}{3}\dx{x}}\right)\\
    \amp = \left[2(x-2) +
    2(y-3)\left(-\frac{5}{3}\right)\right]\dx{x}\\
    \intertext{or}
    \dfdx{A}{x} \amp = 2(x-2) +
    2(y-3)\left(-\frac{5}{3}\right).
  \end{align*}
  Setting $\dfdx{A}{x}$ equal to zero we have
  \begin{align}
    \nonumber    \textcolor{red}{2}(x-2) + \textcolor{red}{2}(y-3)\left(-\frac{5}{3}\right) \amp = 0.\\
    \nonumber    (x-2) + (y-3)\left(-\frac{5}{3}\right) \amp = 0.\\
    \nonumber    x-2-\frac53y+5\amp =0.\\
    \label{eq:LineDist1}    x+3-\frac53\textcolor{red}{y}\amp =0.\\
    \intertext{From our constraint we have
    $\textcolor{red}{y=\frac13(2-5x)}$. Inserting this into
    <xref ref="EQLineDist1">Equation~</xref>) we see that}
    \nonumber
    x+3-\frac53\left(\textcolor{red}{\frac13(2-5x)}\right)\amp =0.\\
    \intertext{Solving for $x$ gives}
    \nonumber    x+3-\frac53\left(\frac23-\frac{5}{3}x)\right)\amp =0,\\
    \nonumber    x+3-\frac{10}{9}+\frac{25}{9}x\amp =0,\\
    \nonumber    \frac{9x+27-10+25x}{9}\amp =0,\\
    \nonumber    \frac{34x+17}{9}\amp =0,\\
    \nonumber    34x\amp =-17\\
    \label{eq:LineDist2}    x\amp =-\frac12.
  \end{align}
</p>
<p>
  
  To find $y$ we use our constraint and the value of $x$ from
  <xref ref="EQLineDist2">Equation~</xref>,
  $$ \bigeval{y}{x}{-1/2}=\bigeval{\frac13(2-5x)}{x}{-1/2}=\frac32.$$
</p>
<p>

  So we have found that the minimal square occurs when $x=-\frac12$,
  and $y=\frac32$ and it feels like we're done, doesn't it? We're not.
  The question asked was ``What is the area of the smallest possible
  square?'' To find the area we need to put $(x,y)=(-1/2, 3/2)$ into
  our area formula which yields
  \begin{align*}
    \bigeval{A(x,y)}
    {(x,y)}
    {\left(-\frac12, \frac32\right)}
    \amp =\bigeval{(x-2)^2+(y-3)^2}
    {(x,y)}
    {\left(-\frac{1}{2},\frac32\right)}\\
    \amp =\left(-\frac12-2\right)^2+\left(\frac12-3\right)^2=\frac{17}{2}\text{ square units.}
  \end{align*}
  Always remember to check that you have actually answered the
  question asked before you stop.

The first step in any optimization problem is to identify the
  objective function. Sometimes more than one will work. In that case
  use the simplest one, but without an objective function we can't
  even get started.

</p>
</li>
<li> 
<p>
We need to identify constraint(s) as well, if any exist. (Not
  all optimization problems will have constraints. Some will have more

  sooner or later.
</p>
</li>
<li> 
<p>
It was intuitively clear from our sketch that there actually is
  a minimal square in this example; that a solution exists. This will
  be true often enough that it will be easy to start believing that
  you can rely on your intuition alone to solve optimization
  problems. This is a mistake.

  Intuition is important and we encourage you to use it, especially
  when you first start thinking about a new problem.  But intuition is
  based on past experience. It is a way of saying that you expect
  today to go pretty much the same way yesterday did. Most of the time
  this is true, but you never know when things will go awry so you
  must always verify that your intuition is correct by some other
  means\aside{Calculus, in this case.}.
</p>
</li>
<li> 
<p>
Most of the heavy lifting in this problem was done in the
  Algebra, not the Calculus. This will be true of many of the
  mathematics problems you will encounter from now on.  There is a
  strong tendency to think of algebraic manipulations as ``just
  algebra'' and to be careless with them. This is also a
  mistake. Every step toward solving a problem is just as important as
  every other step, whether it is Algebra, Calculus, Geometry,
  Arithmetic, or just ``thinking about the problem.''  Every step must
  be successfully completed. Strive to be skillful, and careful, with
  all of your tools.
</p>
</li>
<li> 
<p>
We were very careful to write out, in detail, every algebraic
  and arithmetic step in this problem but if we were to do this for
  every problem this text would become too long to be useful. We don't
  want that to happen so we will regularly do several elementary
  algebraic steps at once.

  But ``elementary'' does not mean ``easy.'' You may not be able to
  follow all of the steps in your head, especially at first. When you
  do not see how to get from one line of computation to the next you
  may be tempted to just skip it. Don't. Do. That.  Keep a writing pad
  handy at all times. If there is any question of understanding a
  given computation take out that pad and do the computation
  yourself. If you are unable to do the computation yourself, ask for
  help. Ask a classmate, a friend, your instructor, whomever. Ask for
  help when you need it.  If you do this habitually you will find that
  following the steps gets easier over time. If you do not it will
  remain difficult forever. We're serious. Do all elementary
  computations yourself!  It is your responsibility to make sure you
  understand the computations we show you.

  The solution in <xref ref="DRILLIntuitiveSquareOnCircle">Drill~\</xref> relies
  heavily on the intuition gained from sketching the problem. As we

  In order to use Fermat's Theorem we must first know that one maximum
  and one minimum exists. No computation we've done guarantees the
  existence of an extremum, let alone its location. However, as a
  result of the work you did to solve
  <xref ref="DRILLIntuitiveSquareOnCircle">Drill~\</xref> we do know, intuitively,
  that there are two optimal solutions: one maximal and one
  minimal. Therefore Fermat's Theorem does guarantee that at each of
  these (wherever they are) $\dfdx{A}{x}=0$.
</p>
<p>

  We proceed as just discussed. Since we know (from
  <xref ref="DRILLIntuitiveSquareOnCircle">Drill~\</xref>) that both a maximal and
  a minimal solution exist we set
  $ \dfdx{A}{x}= 2\left(-2+\frac{3x}{y}\right)=0$. Solving this yields
  <me>
    \label{eq:3x=2y}
    3x=2y,
</me>
  and since (from our constraint,
  <xref ref="EQSqCircleConstraint">Equation~</xref>)) $y=\pm\sqrt{1-x^2}$ we have
  <me>
    3x=\pm2\sqrt{1-x^2}.\label{eq:Sqrt}
</me>
  The square root symbol, and the plus-or-minus ($\pm$) make
  <xref ref="EQSqrt">Equation~</xref>) seem a little scary at first but it is
  really just a quadratic equation in disguise. Squaring both sides of
  <xref ref="EQSqrt">Equation~</xref>) gives $ 9x^2=4(1-x^2)$ or
  <me>
    \label{eq:LostSolution}   13x^2=4.
</me>
</p>
<p>

  So we have two solutions: $x=\frac{2}{\sqrt{13}}$ and
  $x=-\frac{2}{\sqrt{13}}$.  From
  <xref ref="DRILLIntuitiveSquareOnCircle">Drill~\</xref> we know that these must
  correspond to the maximal and minimal solutions. Fermat's Theorem
  doesn't tell us which is which but now all we need to do is
  distinguish between them by evaluating $A(x)$ for each.

<example xml:id="example:DiffvsDer">
<title>Differentials vs. Derivatives</title>
<p>

  <!-- \label{example:DiffvsDer} -->
 But take a moment to consider
  this. Is it clear to you that there must be such a maximal
  rectangle?  If so then, as before, setting the derivative of the
  objective function equal to zero and solving for the variable will
  provide all of the values of the variable where the maximal
  rectangle might occur. If we're lucky there will only be a
  few such and we can check them one at a time.
</p>
<p>

  Finding the objective function is easy. The area, $A$, of any
  rectangle is its length, $l$, times its width, $w$, so
  <me>
    A=lw\label{eq:SquareObjFun}
</me>
  is the objective function.
</p>
<p>

  The perimeter, $P$ is
  <me>
    P=2l +2w\label{eq:SquareConst}
</me>
  and is constrained to be a constant (fixed) value so
  <xref ref="EQSquareConst">Equation~</xref>) is the constraint. Throughout this
  example keep in mind that $P$ is a fixed constant, not a function of
  $l$ and $w$.
</p>
<p>
  At this point we can complete the problem using Calculus in either
  of two equivalent ways.
  <dl>
    <li>
      <title>Using Differentials:</title>
      <p>
        In our opinion this is how Leibniz
        intended for his Calculus to be used so we tend to favor it.
        <ol>
          <li>
            <p>
              Compute $\dx{A} = l\dx{w}+w\dx{l}$, from the objective      function.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              Differentiate the constraint, giving the differential form      of the constraint: $2\dx{l}+2\dx{w}=0.$
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              Set $\dx{A}=0$ and solve this equation using the constraint      and its differential form as needed. In this problem we have      $\dx{l}=-\dx{w}$ so
              <md>
                <mrow>

                  l\dx{w}+w\dx{l} \amp = 0\\
                </mrow>
                <mrow>

                  l\dx{w}-w\dx{w} \amp = 0\\
                  (l-w)\dx{w}\amp =0.

                </mrow>
              </md>

              Since $\dx{w}\neq0$ we have $l=w$ and thus the square encloses
              the most area.
            </p>
          </li>
        </ol>
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <title>Using Derivatives:</title>
      <p>
        The modern approach emphasizes the use of
        functions and derivatives rather than curves and differentials.
        <ol>
          <li>
            <p>
              Solve the constraint for either $w$ or $l$ in terms of the      other. For example, $l=\frac12(P-2w).$
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              Substitute this into the objective function to rewrite it in      terms of a single variable:      $$A(w)=\frac12(P-2w)\cdot w = \frac12(Pw-w^2).$$
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              Now think of the objective function, $A(w)$, as an abstract      function and find its maximum point by setting $\dfdx{A}{w}=0$      and solving for $w$.
            </p>
            <p>
              Proceeding, we have
              $$
              \dfdx{A}{w}=\dfdx {w}\left(\frac12(Pw-2w^2)\right)=\frac12(P-4w)=0
              $$
              so $w=\frac{P}{4}$. Putting this back into our constraint gives
              $P=2\cdot\frac{P}{4}+2l$ we see that $l$ is also equal to
              $\frac{P}{4}$. Since $l=w=\frac{P}{4}$ the square encloses the
              most area.
            </p>  
          </li>
        </ol>
      </p>
    </li>
  </dl>

</p>
<p>
  As we said, the two approaches are completely equivalent.  Use
  whichever feels most comfortable to you.

<!-- \begin{Digression}[Triangles with Fixed Perimeters] -->
<!--   \label{digression:TrianglesWithFixedPerimeters} -->
<!--   In <xref ref="EXfixed-perimeter">Examples</xref> <xref ref="EXAMPLEDiffvsDer">and</xref> we -->
<!--   saw that of all rectangles with fixed perimeter, the square (an -->
<!--   equilateral rectangle) has the largest area. Is this also true of -->
<!--   triangles? More precisely, does an equilateral triangle have the -->
<!--   largest area out of all triangles with a fixed perimeter?  This may -->
<!--   sound like a simpler problem but it is actually a bit harder. -->
  
<!--   Here's why. With a rectangle each set of parallel sides varied -->
<!--   together so we only had two independent parameters to deal with. For -->
<!--   triangles all three sides vary independently, giving us three -->
<!--   independently varying parameters, which is inherently more complex -->
<!--   than two. -->


<!--   How might we address this question? -->

<!--   A standard ploy for solving difficult problems is to first try a -->
<!--   simpler ``adjacent'' problem. To create such a problem in this case -->
<!--   we hold one side fixed and only allow two sides of our triangle to -->
<!--   vary. We'll show that when the area of the triangle is maximal the -->
<!--   two varying sides must be the same length. We want to use this -->
<!--   adjacent problem to gain some insight into how to solve our actual -->
<!--   problem. -->

<!--   So our adjacent problem is this: Given all triangles with a fixed -->
<!--   base and a fixed perimeter, does an isosceles triangle have the -->
<!--   largest area?  The sketch below has all of the pertinent -->
<!--   parameters labeled.\\ -->

<!--   If we hold $b$ fixed minimizing the area, $A=\frac12bh$, is -->
<!--   equivalent to maximizing $h$. So the length of $h$ is the natural -->
<!--   objective function for this problem. Also if $h$ is at its maximum -->
<!--   then by Fermat's Theorem (<xref ref="THMFermatsTheorem">Theorem~\</xref>), $\dx{h}=0$. Notice that -->
<!--   there are two right triangles in our sketch and $h$ is the height of -->

    Because they are called ``Optimization Problems'' it is natural to assume that such
    problems are always about finding the maximum or minimum value of
    something. Certainly many of them are, but not all.  Optimization
    problems come in two flavors:
    <ol>
      <li>
        <p>
          Find the extreme values of some objective function, if there
          are any.  Examples of this kind of problem are

        </p>
      </li>

          Show that some property holds when the objective function is

<p>

Another example of this second type is the problem of reflecting light
we looked at in <xref ref="CHAPTERScienceBeforeCalc">Chapter</xref>. Recall that
we showed that light bounces off of a mirror in such a manner that the
angle of incidence equals the angle of reflection.  We did this by
reasoning geometrically from the figure at the right to show that the
minimal path must satisfy the condition $\alpha=\gamma$.
</p>
<p>

The geometric argument was actually pretty easy to understand once we
found the right trick. But that's the difficulty. The geometric
argument required the very counter-intuitive trick of pretending that
the light passed through the mirror instead of reflecting off of it!
Calculus provides a more systematic approach, one that does not
require a stroke-of-genius level of insight to solve each new
problem. Let's re-solve this problem, this time using the Calculus
tools we've learned.
</p>
<p>

We will need an objective function so we modify the sketch above to
suit the needs of Calculus. In particular, the relevant quantities
need names as shown below.
</p>

<image source="images/ReflectingMirror5.png" width="60%" />
<!-- \centerline{ -->
<!--   \includegraphics*[height=2in,width=5in]{../Figures/ReflectingMirror5}} -->
<p>
We assume that $a$ (the height of the light source), $b$ (the height
of the observer's eye), and $c$ (the distance between the light source
and the observer) are constants while $x, y, z$, and $w$ are
variables.
</p>
<p>

We wish to show that when the path of the light from $A$ to $R$ to $B$
is shortest, then $\alpha=\beta$. Since the length of that path is
$z+w$ a natural objective function is:

<me>
  \label{eq:RefMir1} L=z+w.
</me>
We also have the following constraints
\begin{align}
  \label{eq:RefMir2}  a^2+x^2\amp =z^2, \text{ and}\\
  \label{eq:RefMir3} b^2+y^2\amp =w^2.\\
  \label{eq:RefMir4} x+y\amp =c.
\end{align}
</p>
<p>

Differentiating <xref ref="EQRefMir1">Equation~</xref>) gives
$\dx{L} = \dx{z}+\dx{w}$.
</p>
<p>

Differentiating <xref ref="EQRefMir2">Equation~</xref>) gives
$\dx{z}=\frac{x}{z}\dx{x}$ so, combining these two results, we have
$$
\dx{L} = \frac{x}{z}\dx{x}+\dx{w}.
$$
</p>
<p>

Differentiating <xref ref="EQRefMir3">Equation</xref>
gives$\dx{w}=\frac{y}{w}\dx{y}$, so
$$
\dx{L} = \frac{x}{z}\dx{x}+\frac{y}{w}\dx{y}.
$$
</p>
<p>

And finally differentiating <xref ref="EQRefMir4">Equation~</xref>) gives
$\dx{y} = -\dx{x}$, so that
$$
\dx{L} = \frac{x}{z}\dx{x}-\frac{y}{w}\dx{x},
$$
or
$$
\dfdx{L}{x} = \frac{x}{z}-\frac{y}{w}.
$$
</p>
<p>


Now suppose that the path from $A$ to $R$ to $B$ is the shortest
possible path, i.e., suppose that $L$ is minimal. Then by Fermat's
Theorem we know that $\dfdx{L}{x}=0$, and therefore
$$
\frac{x}{z}=\frac{y}{w}.
$$
Since $\frac{x}{z}=\cos(\alpha)$ and $\frac{y}{w}=\cos(\beta)$ we see
that $\alpha=\beta$.
</p>
<p>

This Calculus based argument is not as elegant as the geometric
argument we used in <xref ref="CHAPTERScienceBeforeCalc">Chapter</xref>. In the
geometric argument we could easily visualize what was happening.  Our
Calculus based argument wasn't at all visual and it involved a lot of
computation. But, believe it or not, this is a strength not a
weakness.  None of the computations are particularly hard, just
tedious and detailed. But -- and this is the point -- we also had a
clearly defined procedure to follow. We needed to: (1) Compute
$\dfdx{L}{x}$, and (2) set $\dfdx{L}{x}$ equal to zero.  The rest was
Algebra which is straightforward though not necessarily easy.

<!-- <title>Rainbows</title> -->




<!-- Look carefully at the double rainbow in the pictures below and notice -->
<!-- that the order of the colors is reversed from the primary (brighter) -->
<!-- to the secondary rainbow?  Why do you think this -->
<!-- happens?\\ -->

<!-- <image source="images/SavageEnariRainbow.png" width="60%" /> -->
<!-- <!-\- \centerline{\includegraphics*[height=3in,width=5.6in]{../Figures/SavageEnariRainbow}} -\-> -->

<!-- A few other questions come readily to mind. What conditions are -->
<!-- required for a rainbow to form? Why is red on the top of the primary -->
<!-- rainbow?  Why is the primary rainbow below the secondary one? Why is -->
<!-- the primary rainbow brighter and why are double rainbows so rare? -->

<!-- To tackle these questions the first thing we'll need to do is build a -->
<!-- mathematical model of the problem. As you will see developing the -->
<!-- model is probably the most challenging part. -->

<!-- When a ray of light enters a raindrop it gets both refracted and -->
<!-- reflected, so we will need to use all that we have learned about how -->
<!-- light refracts and reflects. Clearly Snell's Law will play a prominent -->
<!-- role. To keep things simple we assume the drop is spherical. -->

<!-- By the Principle of Local Linearity when light strikes a point on a -->
<!-- curved surface it will refract (if the surface is transparent) or -->
<!-- reflect (if the surface is reflective) as if the surface is actually -->
<!-- the line tangent to the surface. Since we're assuming for simplicity -->
<!-- that our raindrops are spherical this means that the light will -->
<!-- reflect or refract as if it is striking the tangent line of the circle -->
<!-- in the diagram at the point where the light enters the droplet, $A$, -->
<!-- exits the droplet, $C$, or reflects inside of the droplet, $B$.  All -->
<!-- of the angles in the diagram at the right are measured between the -->
<!-- light beam (in red) and the extended radii (blue, dashed lines) at -->
<!-- points $A$, $B$, and $C$. -->

<!-- As displayed in the diagram above, the light ray traveling at velocity -->
<!-- $v_1$, entering the raindrop at $A$ and making an angle of $\alpha$ -->
<!-- radians with the radial line $OA$ is refracted to an angle of radian -->
<!-- measure $\beta$ according to Snell's Law: -->
<!-- $$\frac{\sin(\alpha)}{v_1}=\frac{\sin(\beta)}{v_2},$$ where  -->
<!-- $v_2$ is the velocity of light inside the raindrop. It is helpful to -->
<!-- think of this refraction as a rotation about the point $A$. This is -->
<!-- ``Rotation 1'' in the diagram below. The reflection at point $B$ and -->
<!-- the refraction at point $C$ can similarly be thought of as rotations -->
<!-- about their respective points. -->

<!-- Actually, only a portion of the light is refracted. The rest is -->
<!-- reflected off the exterior of the raindrop, and is no longer of -->

<!-- of the raindrop (again only a portion is reflected) so that the angle -->

<!-- From this graph it appears that the minimum of the curve is -->

<!-- occurs when the angle at which the light enters the raindrop is -->
<!-- $\alpha\approx1.03 \text{ radians }\approx59.4^\circ$.  Notice (from -->

<!--   coming into play again.} for values of $\alpha$ near $1.03$ the -->
<!-- amount of deviation is roughly the same for those values of $\alpha$. -->


<!-- This is pertinent because it means that the lower the deviation angle -->
<!-- the more concentrated that light rays exiting the raindrop. So the -->

<!-- highest concentration when exiting the raindrop.  At other values of -->

<!-- rays that we see as a rainbow. -->

<title>Global vs. Local Extrema</title>

<!-- \label{sec:more-optimal-squares} -->

<p>

So far in this chapter we've relied heavily on our intuition. For
instance, in <xref ref="EXAMPLESqOnLine">Example</xref> it was very clear that a
minimal square exists. Moreover, when we differentiated the objective
function we found that $x=-\frac12$ was the only solution of
$\dfdx{A}{x}=0$. So it was reasonable to conclude that the minimum
occurs when $x=-\frac12$.
</p>
<p>

Similarly in <xref ref="PROBLEMEllipseDist">Problem</xref> it was intuitively
clear that there was both a maximal and a minimal square, so when
we found two solutions of $\dfdx{A}{x}=0$ it made sense to conclude
that they correspond to the maximal and minimal squares, respectively.
</p>
<p>

Unfortunately things are rarely this straightforward.  Consider the
following example.
</p>

<example xml:id="example:ParabolaOptSqr">
<title>Constructing a Square on a Parabola</title>
<p>

  <!-- \label{example:ParabolaOptSqr} -->
  We would like to find the area of the smallest square which can be
  constructed with one corner at the point $(2,3)$ and an adjacent
  corner on the graph of $ y = x^2$.  This example is very similar to
  <xref ref="PROBLEMMinSqLine">Problem</xref> or <xref ref="PROBLEMEllipseDist">Problem</xref>
  so we will proceed in much the same way.  The objective function is
  the same
  <me>
    \label{eq:ParabolaObjective}
    A = (x-2)^2 + (y-3)^2
</me>
  but this time the constraint is
  <me>
    \label{eq:ParabolaConstraint}
    y = x^2.
</me>
</p>
<p>
  
  In our previous examples we began by differentiating both the
  objective function and the constraint. This time substitute the
  constraint $y=x^2$ into $A(x)$ to obtain the objective function
  $$
  A(x) = (x-2)^2 + (x^2-3)^2
  $$
  in terms of a single variable. We make this change of strategy
  simply to demonstrate that the two procedures are equivalent.  In
  fact, for this particular problem they are almost identical. For
  more complex problems you may find that you prefer one strategy or
  the other.
</p>
                  </example>
  <exercise xml:id="drill:SqParab">
<statement>
<p>
    <!-- \label{drill:SqParab} -->
    Show that $\dfdx{A}{x}=0$ when $x \approx1.75$, $x \approx-1.32$
    and $x \approx-0.43$.  Getting three distinct solutions of
    $\dfdx{A}{x}=0$ is quite unexpected in light of our previous work.
    Can you explain this?
  </p>
</statement>
</exercise>

<!-- \begin{wrapfigure}[15]{r}{2.7in} -->
<!--     \captionsetup{labelformat=empty} -->
<!--     \centerline{\includegraphics*[height=2.5in,width=2.7in]{../Figures/ParabolaThreeSquares}} -->
<!--     \label{fig:ParabolaThreeSquares} -->
<!--   \end{wrapfigure} -->
<p>  To find the minimal square in <xref ref="DRILLSqParab">Drill~\</xref> we need
  only substitute the $x$-values into $A(x)$. We get
  \begin{align*}
    \textcolor{darkpastelgreen}{A(1.75)} \amp \textcolor{darkpastelgreen}{\approx 0.07},\\
    \textcolor{violet}{A(-1.32)}\amp  \textcolor{violet}{\approx 12.6},\\
    A(-0.43)\amp  \approx 13.83.
  \end{align*}
  From these numbers, and from the sketch at the right, we can see
  that the minimal square seems to be the one whose second corner lies
  on the parabola at the point (approximately) $(1.75, 3.06)$. But
  those other two solutions of $\dfdx{A}{x}=0$ are troubling.  Do we
  get a maximal square at $\left(-0.43,(-0.43)^2\right)$ since
  $A(-0.43) \approx 13.83$ is the largest value of $A(x)$ among the
  three we've identified. And what about the point $(-1.32, 1.32^2)$?
  We clearly get neither a minimum nor a maximum. Why did our solution
  procedure point to it? This is all very puzzling.
</p>
  
<image source="images/ParabolaThreeSquares2.png" width="50%"/>
<!-- \begin{wrapfigure}[14]{l}{2.5in} -->
<!--     \captionsetup{labelformat=empty} \vskip-4mm  -->
<!--     \centerline{\includegraphics*[height=2.2in,width=2.5in]{../Figures/ParabolaThreeSquares2}} -->
<!--     \label{fig:ParabolaThreeSquares2} -->
<!--   \end{wrapfigure} -->
<p>

  To begin addressing these questions let's look at the graph of our
  objective function, $A(x) = (x-2)^2 + (x^2-3)^2$.  The first
  coordinate of each point on the graph at the left corresponds to the
  $x$-coordinate of the corner of a square which lies on the
  constraint, $y=x^2$, and the second coordinate on the graph is the
  area of that square. Thus the minimal square will correspond to the
  lowest point on the graph at the left which is the square with a
  second corner at $x=1.75$ as we have already concluded.  But since
  the graph at the left continues to rise as we look farther to the
  right (or left) it should also be clear that there is no maximal
  square.
</p>
<p>

  This graph also explains the why our procedure identified the
  squares with a second corner at both $x=-1.32$ and $x=-0.43$ as
  possible minimal squares as well.  When we solve $\dfdx{A}{x}=0$ we
  are locating the points on the graph of our objective function where
  its derivative is zero. That is, where the slope of the line tangent
  is horizontal. Fermat's Theorem only assures us that if $A(x)$ has
  an extremum at $x=a$ then $\dfdxat{A}{x}{a}=0$. In particular it
  does not tell us that there are no other values of $x$ where
  $\dfdx{A}{x}=0$.
</p>


<image source="images/ParabolaThreeSquares4.png" width="50%"/>
<!-- \begin{wrapfigure}[19]{l}{1.5in} -->
<!--     \captionsetup{labelformat=empty} \vskip-4mm  -->
<!--     \centerline{\includegraphics*[height=3in,width=1.5in]{../Figures/ParabolaThreeSquares4}} -->
<!--     \label{fig:ParabolaThreeSquares3} -->
<!--   \end{wrapfigure} -->
<p>

  The problem here is that we have not been precise in our
  language. When we say ``maximum'' (or minimum) in ordinary speech we
  mean ``the largest one,'' and it is clear that there can only be one
  ``largest\aside{Although it can occur more than once, at different
    places. Think about the graph of $y=\sin(x).$}.''
</p>
<p>

  However, if we confine our attention to the part of the graph inside
  the blue rectangle at the left we see that the point at
  $(-1.32, 12.6)$ is a minimum <alert>locally</alert> and the point at
  $(-0.43, 13.83)$ is a maximum <alert>locally</alert>. By ``locally'' we
  mean ``if we restrict our attention to the graph near those two
  points'' as seen at the right. We will need to distinguish between
  local and global optima in the future.
</p>
<p>

  There are other issues as well.
</p>
<p>

  Recall from <xref ref="DIGRESSIONTangentHasNoInverse">Digression~\</xref> that a
  function has two parts:
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item A rule to associate input with output, and
  \item A domain.
  \end{enumerate}
  Change either of these and you have a different function.
</p>
<p>

  In this example our objective function is
  <me>
    \label{eq:ParabolaSquareDomainR}
    A(x) =
    (x-2)^2 + (x^2-3)^2
    $$
    and the constraint is
    $$
    y=x^2, \text{ with domain $\RR$} .
</me>
  But suppose we change the constraint to
  <me>
    \label{eq:ParabolaSquareConstraintRestricted}
    y=x^2, \text{ with domain $-2\le x\le 0.5$, (the part inside
      the blue rectangle).}
</me>
</p>
<p>

  We now have a different problem because the only part of the graph
  we are interested in is the piece inside the blue rectangle. The
  global minimum no longer occurs at $x\approx1.75$ because $1.75$ is
  not in the problem domain, $x\approx1.75$ simply
  doesn't exist in the domain of the function $y=x^2$,  with
    domain; $-2\le x\le 0.5$.  However, since $x=-0.43$ and $x=-1.32$ are in the
  domain they still correspond to a local maximum and a local minimum,
  respectively. Are they also the global maximum and minimum?  Give
  this question some thought and take your best guess. We will return
  to it in <xref ref="PROBLEMParabolaSquare-Redux">Problem~\</xref>.
</p>

<!-- \end{wrapfigure} -->
<p>

The existence of local extrema really complicates things for us
because it means we have to find all of the <term>local</term> extrema and
then figure out which of them, if any, are global.  If we don't get
organized we're likely to have a lot of trouble keeping this all
straight.
</p>
<p>

In the sketch at the right $y(a)$ is the <term>global</term> minimum of $y$
since it is the lowest point on the graph of $y(x)$, whereas $y(c)$ is
a local minimum because it is the lowest point on the graph when the
domain of $y(x)$ is restricted to the interval $(c-\eps, c+\eps)$
(between the dashed lines).  In this sketch the global maximum of
$y(x)$ occurs at the endpoints of the interval, $\alpha$ and $\beta$.
The fact that extrema can also occur at endpoints is a complicating
detail we will come back to shortly.
</p>
<p>

Since the domain of the function affects the location of the extrema a
definition of extrema  will
need to reference the function's domain. It is easy to get lost in the technicalities so keep
<xref ref="EXAMPLEParabolaOptSqr">Example~\</xref> in mind as we proceed.

<!-- \label{subsec:optim-abstr-probl} -->

<introduction>
<p>

As we saw in <xref ref="EXAMPLEParabolaOptSqr">Example~\</xref> once we've found
the objective function, $O(x)$, our optimization problem becomes the
more abstract problem of finding the extreme points of the graph of
$O(x)$. An optimization problem ultimately comes down to finding all
of the local extrema. The maximum among those will be the global
maximum, and the minimum among those will be the global
minimum. Assuming of course, that either exists.
</p>
<p>
  
Thus our first task is to identify all of the local extrema.  But
finding the local extreme points of the graph of an arbitrary
objective function can be more complicated than we've seen in any of
our examples so far. In this section we will address these
complications. By the end of the section we will have a general
procedure for solving this more abstract optimization problem.

<title>Identifying and Distinguishing Maxima and Minima</title>
<p>

Use your favorite graphing utility to graph the function
$ O(x)=x^3-3x $ and confirm visually that it has a local maximum at
$(-1, 2)$, and a local minimum at $(1,-2)$.  This seems to be easy to
do when we have the graph in front of us.  But in the absence of a
graph how could we tell which is the maximum and which is the minimum?
</p>
<p>

  Sometimes even having the graph isn't much help. For example, see if
  you can visually identify the global maximum and global minimum of
  the graph of
  $$
  O(x)=(x^4-17x^3+239x)\sin(2x),\; 10\le x\le20.
  $$
</p>
<p>
  
  We'll need an analytic method; one that doesn't rely on pictures.
  To that end, consider the following theorem from elementary Algebra.
</p>

<theorem xml:id="thm:FDT-lines">
<p>
<!-- \label{thm:FDT-lines} -->

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>
      If a line has positive slope then the $y$ coordinate  increases as the $x$ coordinate increases.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      If a line has negative slope then the $y$ coordinate  decreases as the $x$ coordinate increases.
    </p>
  </li>
</ol>
</p>
</theorem>

<p>
  Lines are easy to think about of course, because the slope of a line
  is constant. If the slope of a line is $5$ here, then it is also $5$
  over there, and way back there too. But we know that the slope of a
  curve can change from point to point so we will need to generalize
  <xref ref="THMFDT-lines">Theorem</xref> to a statement about curves.
  <xref ref="THMFDT-lines">Theorem~\</xref> generalizes to curves as follows.
</p>

<theorem xml:id="thm:FDT">
  <title>The First Derivative Test</title>
  <p>
    <!-- \label{thm:FDT} -->
    Suppose $f$ is a function of $x$.  The following statements are
    true\aside{This is a rather naive statement of this theorem, but
    it will suffice for our current purposes. We will revisit,
    restate, and prove the First Derivative Test in
    <xref ref="SECfirst-deriv-test">Section</xref>}:    
    <ol>
      <li>
        <p>
          If $f^\prime(a)\gt 0$, on some interval then $f(x)$ is    increasing on the interval.

      <li>
        <p>
          If $f^\prime(a)\lt 0$, on some interval then $f(x)$ is    decreasing on the interval.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ol>
  </p>
</theorem>


  
  <p>
  The First Derivative test is precisely the tool we need to
  distinguish a maximum from a minimum.  It will also turn out to be
  the tool that will allow us to determine via computation, rather
  than intuition, if a given objective function has a maximum or
  minimum.  Take a moment to think about how this might be done before
  reading further.
</p>

<subsection xml:id="no-label">
<title>Transition Points, and Possible Transition Points on
    Open Intervals</title>

<p>

  For the moment notice that we are confining our attention to
  functions whose domains are open intervals.
</p>
<p>
  
  From <xref ref="THMFDT">Theorem</xref> we see that if the derivative of $O(x)$
  is positive then $O(x)$ is increasing and if the derivative of
  $O(x)$ is negative then $O(x)$ is decreasing. So, at a maximum
  $O(x)$ will transition from increasing to decreasing, and
  $O^\prime(x)=\dfdx{O}{x}$ will transition from positive to
  negative. We conclude that to find a maximum we need to find those
  places where the derivative transitions from positive to negative.
</p>
<p>


  Similarly, to find a local minimum, we need to find a place where
  the derivative transitions from negative to positive.  We call such
  points <term>optimal transition points</term> because they are the places
  where (local) optima must occur.
</p>
<p>

  The simplest way for $O^\prime(x)=\dfdx{O}{x}$ to make either
  transition is for it to pass through zero. Thus the solutions of
  $O^\prime(x) = \dfdx{O}{x} =0$ are <term>possible optimal transition
    points (POTPs)</term> because these are points where and optimum might
  occur. This is not guaranteed.
</p>
<p>
  
  In the simplest case all we have to do is find the solutions of
  $O^\prime(x)=\dfdx{O}{x}$, then determine the sign of the derivative
  on either side of each such point. If it changes then we have a
  local extremum.
</p>
<p>

</p>

  <exercise xml:id="drill:TransitionQuestion">
<statement>
<p>
    <!-- \label{drill:TransitionQuestion} In the paragraph above we used -->
    the phrase ``in the simplest case.'' We chose our words
    carefully. Can you think of another way for
    $O^\prime(x) =\dfdx{O}{x}$ to transition from positive to
    negative, or from negative to positive?  Give this some
    thought. We will come back to it.
  </p>
</statement>
</exercise>
<p>
  The POTPs which are solutions of $\dfdx{O}{x}=0$ are the easiest to
  think about and work with so we will focus on those for
  now. Unfortunately, extrema can sometimes occur at other points as
  well. We will address that possibility once we have thoroughly
  examined this simpler case.
</p>
  <example xml:id="example:PPT">
    <!-- \label{example:PPT} -->
<p>

    Let $O(x)=x^3-3x$.  The solutions of $\dfdx{O}{x}=3x^2-3=0$ are
    $x=-1$ and $x=1$ so these are the POTPs.  Sketch the graph of
    $O(x)$ and follow along with our reasoning below, confirming our
    conclusions visually.
</p>
<p>


    To determine if they actually are transition points we proceed as
    follows:
    \begin{description}
    \item[At \boldmath $x=-1$:] Pick a number less than $-1$, say
      $x=-2.$ Since $\dfdxat{O}{x}{-2}\gt 0$ we see that $O(x)$ is
      increasing to the left of $x=-1.$ Next pick a number between
      $-1$ and the next POTP, $x=1$. We'll take $x=0$. Since
      $\dfdxat{O}{x}{0}\lt0$ we see that $O(x)$ is decreasing to the
      right of $x=-1$. Thus $O(-1) =2$ is a local maximum value of
      $O(x)$.
    \item[At \boldmath  $x=1$:] % Pick a number between the previous
                  As we saw above $O(x)$ is decreasing to the left of $x=1$ since
      $\dfdxat{O}{x}{0}\lt0$. (Zero is between $x=-1$ and $x=1$.) Next
      choose any number to the right of $x=1$. We'll choose
      $x=2$. Since $\dfdxat{O}{x}{2}\gt0$ we see that $O(x)$ is
      increasing to the right of $x=1$. Thus $O(1)=-2$ is a local
      minimum of $O(x)$.
    \end{description}
</p>
<p>

  
    In this example we only tested one number between adjacent
    POTPs. Is that enough? Give this some thought before reading on.
</p>
<p>

    Of course it is. Consider that the POTPs are precisely those
    places where $O^\prime(x)$ might change sign. Therefore the sign
    of $O^\prime(x)$ must either be always positive or always negative
    in between POTPs. Therefore, we only need to test at one value of
    $x$ to find the sign of $O(x)$ on the entire interval between
    POTPs.
</p>
<p>

    If $a$ is the greatest POTP we need only test the sign of one
    number greater than $a$ to determine the sign of $O^\prime(x)$ for
    every value of $x$ greater than $a$.
</p>
<p>

    Similarly, if $a$ is the least POTP we need only test the sign of
    one number less than $a$ to determine the sign of $O^\prime(x)$
    for every value of $x$ less than $a$.
</p>
<p>

    We state all of this formally in <xref ref="LEMMAAdjRoots">Lemma~\</xref>
    below.

  Find all extrema of the graph of $O(x)=x^5$.
</p>
<p>

  Solving $\dfdxat{O}{x}{0}=5x^4=0$ we see that $x=0$ is the only
  POTP. But elsewhere $O^\prime(x)\gt 0$ (confirm this) so
  $\dfdx{O}{x}$ is positive for every value of $x$ except zero. In
  particular it is positive on the left and on the right of
  zero. Therefore $O(x)=x^5$ never transitions between increasing
  and decreasing, so we conclude that it does not have an extremum
  at $x=0$, despite the fact that $\dfdxat{O}{x}{0}=0$. This may
  seem very curious until you graph the function.

  <example xml:id="example:ParabolaSquare-Redux">
<title>Constructing a Parabola on a Square   (Example~\#\ref{example:ParabolaOptSqr}), Revisited</title>
<p>
    <!-- \label{example:ParabolaSquare-Redux} -->
    Given our new understanding of the distinction between local and
    global extrema we will revisit
    Example~\#\ref{example:ParabolaOptSqr}. Recall the problem:
    \begin{center}
      \begin{minipage}{.8\linewidth}
        Find the area of the smallest square which can be constructed
        with one corner at the point $(2,3)$ and an adjacent corner on
        the graph of $ y = x^2$.
      \end{minipage}
    \end{center}
    The objective function is still $ A = (x-2)^2 + (y-3)^2 $ so when
    we substitute the constraint, $y = x^2$, we get the abstract
    problem of finding the lowest points on the graph of
    $$
    A(x) = (x-2)^2 + (x^2-3)^2
    $$

</p>
<p>

    Solving $\dfdx{A}{x}=0$ gives us three POTPs: $x \approx-1.32$,
    $x \approx-0.43$, and $x \approx1.75$ as before, so the intervals
    we need are, $(-\infty, -1.32)$, $(-1.32, -0.43)$,
    $(-0.43, 1.75)$, and $(1.75, \infty)$.  Because our POTPs are
    approximations these intervals are also approximate.

</p>
<p>

    Now pretend that you don't already know the solution of this
    problem.  Just as in Example~\#\ref{example:PPT} we can use the
    First Derivative Test to determine which of the POTPs we've
    identified corresponds to a local minimum or maximum.

  negative, or from negative to positive'' without passing through
  zero. Clearly this is possible, otherwise we would not have asked.
  But it's hard to see how this can be isn't it? After all, at a
  transition point the derivative of the objective function changes
  signs: It transitions from negative-to-positive or from
  positive-to-negative. Obviously, the only number that has positive

<p>

  Based on <xref ref="DRILLCubeRoot2">Drill~\</xref> it would be easy to conclude
  that the derivative of $y(x)$ can only be undefined at a point $x$
  where the formula for $\dfdx{y}{x}$ requires that we divide by
  zero. But this conclusion is due to the poverty of our experience
  with non-differentiabilty.
</p>
<p>

    There are many ways that a function can fail to be differentiable at
  a point. Dividing by zero is only one of them. In many ways it is
  the simplest.  The family of non-differentiable functions is a very
  unhappy family, indeed. We might even call it dysfunctional.
</p>
<p>

  The  functions whose graphs are shown below is a representative sample of
  functions which are non-differentiable at
  $x=0$. Can you see what they all have in common?\\

<p>
  In our comments just before <xref ref="DEFLocalLinearity">Definition~\</xref> we
  stated that the Principle of Local Linearity is exactly what makes
  Calculus useful and we have relied on that truth in all of our
  subsequent investigations. But there is more to it than that. The
  Principle of Local Linearity is not only what makes Differential
  Calculus useful, its what makes Differential Calculus possible.
</p>

<image source="images/NonDiff2.png" width="50%"/>
<!-- \begin{wrapfigure}[5]{l}{.7in} -->
<!--     \captionsetup{labelformat=empty} -->
<!--     \centerline{\includegraphics*[height=.7in,width=.7in]{../Figures/NonDiff2}} -->
<!--     \label{fig:NonDiff2} -->
<!--   \end{wrapfigure} -->
<p>

  Take another look at graph (a) above, $y(x) = \abs{x}$.  Do you see
  that the Principle of Local Linearity is not in play near the point
  $(0,0)$? No matter how much we zoom in on this point the graph will
  never resemble a straight line,  any straight line. It looks like
  the sketch at the left at every scale.
</p>
<p>

  The same is true of every function given above. They all violate the
  Principle of Local Linearity. Near $x=0$ none of them looks like a
  straight line no matter what viewing scale we use.
</p>
<p>

  The case of a
  vertical tangent line is slightly problematic because near $x=0$ the graph
  of, for example, $y=x^{\frac13}$ looks like a vertical straight
   line. But the derivative of $y=x^{\frac13}$  is
   $$\dfdx{y}{x}=\frac{1}{3x^{\frac23}}$$ so it is  not differentiable
   at zero, which is the point: Any point where a given function is
   not differentiable is a POTP.
</p>
<p>

  We formalize this observation with the following definition.

<title>Transition Points on a Closed Interval; the Problem of Endpoints</title>
  <!-- \label{sec:optim-clos-interv} -->
<p>

  Real world optimization problems will have a natural domain on which
  the objective function is defined.  It is pointless to consider
  values of $x$ outside of that domain. We actually saw this in
  <xref ref="EXAMPLECircleDist">Example</xref>, although we didn't remark on it at
  the time. Recall that in <xref ref="EXAMPLECircleDist">Example</xref> we needed
  to optimize the area of a square with one of its corners on the unit
  circle: $x^2+y^2=1.$ Obviously it makes no sense to consider any
  value of $x$ greater than $1$ or less than $-1$ (why not?), so the
  natural domain of this problem is $-1\le x\le 1$.
</p>
<p>


  When the natural domain of a problem is a closed interval (one that
  includes both endpoints) it is possible that an extremum might also
  occur at one of those endpoints.
</p>

  <example xml:id="example:SqrClosed">

    <!-- \label{example:SqrClosed} -->
  <figure>
<caption>
<url href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Achilles%27_heel" visual="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Achilles%27_heel">This figure needs a caption.</url>
</caption>
<image source="images/ObjSqr.png" width="50%"/>
</figure>
<!-- \begin{wrapfigure}[8]{r}{1.5in} -->
<!--     \captionsetup{labelformat=empty} \vskip-8mm  -->
<!--     \centerline{\includegraphics*[height=1.5in,width=1.5in]{../Figures/ObjSqr}} -->
<!--     \label{fig:ObjSqr} -->
<!--   \end{wrapfigure} -->
<p>

  For example, suppose we need to optimize the function,
  $$
  O(x) = x^2,\; -1\le x\le 2.
  $$
  From the graph at the right we can see that this function has a
  global minimum at $(0,0)$. We can find this minimum by the methods
  we are already familiar with.  But it also has a local maximum at
  $(-1,1)$ and global maximum at $(2,4)$, and nothing we've done so
  far would identify these two points as possible extrema.
</p>
<p>

  It is clear from the graph what is happening, though. If we hadn't
  restricted the domain of our function then the graph would continue
  to rise on both sides and there would be no local or global maximum
  at all.  The restriction on the domain forces the graph to stop
  rising at the endpoints of the interval which makes each of these
  endpoints a local maximum.
</p>
<p>

  Thus we see that when the domain of our function is a closed
  interval there is also the possibility that a local or global
  extremum might occur at the endpoints of the interval as well. As a
  result, when searching for extrema we must always check the
  endpoints of the domain interval (if there are any).
</p>
<p>

  To be clear, the end points of a closed interval are not transition
  points because there can be no transition between increasing and
  decreasing at an endpoint. It simply stops. However, since it is
  possible to have extrema at the endpoints they must also be checked
  whenever they are in play.
</p>
<p>

  


        
  Be careful. When the domain of a function is artificially
  constrained like this it is easy to forget that the constraint is
  present. We tend to think of it as ``not really there.''  This is a
  mistake. Recall from
  <xref ref="DIGRESSIONTangentHasNoInverse">Digression~\</xref> that the
  definition of the domain is a part of the definition of a
  function. Think of the function's domain as the ``universe'' for
  that particular problem. Nothing exists outside of the domain. Thus
  in this example nothing exists outside of the interval (universe)
  $[-1,2]$.
</p>
</example>
<p>

It appears that to find global extrema for a function whose domain
consists entirely of closed intervals all we need to do is
\begin{enumerate}
\item Find the POTPs.
\item Evaluate our objective function at the POTPs and at any end
  points of intervals in the domain of the objective function.
\item Determine which among those is greatest and which is least.
\end{enumerate}
</p>
<p>

And that's it. When the domain of our function is a closed interval
(or the union of closed intervals) optimization really is that
straightforward\aside{Remember that ``straightforward'' does not mean
  ``easy.''}.
</p>
<p>

We formalize all of this in <xref ref="THMmax-min">Theorem</xref> below.
</p>

<theorem xml:id="thm:max-min">
<title>Extreme Value Theorem</title>
<p>
  <!-- \label{thm:max-min} -->
  If $f(x)$ is a continuous function whose domain consists entirely of
  closed, bounded intervals then:
  \begin{enumerate}[label={  (\alph*)}]
  \item There is at least one point in the domain, say $x=c$ such that
    $f(c)$ is the global maximum value of $f(x)$.  Moreover $c$ will
    either be an end point of one of the domain intervals, or an
    optimal transition point.
  \item There is least one point in the domain, say $x=d$, and $f(d)$
    is the global minimum of $f(x)$.  Moreover $d$ will either be an
    end point of one of the domain intervals, or optimal transition
    point.

<section xml:id="sec:conc-second-deriv-1">
<title>Concavity and the Second Derivative Test</title>
<introduction>
<!-- \label{sec:conc-second-deriv-1} -->
<p>
<xref ref="THMmax-min">Theorem</xref> explicitly assumed that the domain of our
function consisted of closed (and bounded) intervals. This assumption was
crucial. Without this assumption even simple functions that you would
expect to have extrema do not.
</p>
<example xml:id="example:OpenNoExtrema">
  <!-- \label{example:OpenNoExtrema} -->
<p>
  For example, suppose our objective function is $O(x)=x$, and that
  the domain is the open interval $(-1,1)$.  Do you see why the graph
  of this function has no extrema of any kind?  If not here is one way
  to prove it.
</p>
<p>
  \begin{myproof}
    Observe that $\dfdx{O}{x}=1\gt 0$. Therefore $O(x)$ is always
    increasing on $(-1,1)$.  If $x$ is any number between $-1$ and $1$
    then $f(x)$ can't be a maximum (minimum) because any number just
    to the right (left) of $x$ will give us an $f(x)$ that is higher
    (lower) than $f(x)$.

    Can we always find a number ``just to the right'' of $x$ without
    leaving the interval $(-1,1)?$ Sure. Just take the number halfway
    between $x$ and $1.$
  \end{myproof}
</p>
</example>

  <exercise xml:id="no-label">
<statement>
<p>
    Show that the function $O(x)=x$ also has no minimum on the open
    interval $(-1,1)$.
  </p>
</statement>
</exercise>
<p>

This leaves us with a dilemma: If the domain is not closed and bounded
we can't
rely on the Extreme Value Theorem to guarantee the existence of extrema. In
fact <xref ref="EXAMPLEOpenNoExtrema">Example~\</xref> shows that there might not
be any extrema. But if there are we'd still like to be able to
find them.
</p>
<p>

This is a problem but it is not an insurmountable problem. In fact we
already have most of the tools we need.  It is still true that local
extrema, if they exist, can only occur at optimal transition points or
at endpoints. So finding these is still the first step.
</p>

<example xml:id="example:FDT1">
  <!-- \label{example:FDT1} -->
<p>

  For this example we strongly suggest that you do not graph the
  objective functions first. Yes, we know this goes directly against
  our previous advice to always visualize your problem when you can,
  but one purpose of this section is for you to learn to analyze a
  problem using your Calculus tools. Much as an airline pilot must
  train to fly using only the cockpit instruments in case they have no
  other choice due to poor visibility, you should also practice
  ``flying blind'' so you can be successful even when you are not able
  to draw a useful graph.  You will learn more, and you will learn
  better, that way.
</p>
<p>

  Of course, once we've moved beyond this section you should visualize
  your problem if you possibly can. We weren't kidding about that. You
  don't want to fly blind, you just need to be able to when it is
  necessary.
</p>
<p>

  From the information gethered in <xref ref="DRILLO1O2">Drill:</xref> can we
  conclude that either $O_1(x)$ or $O_2(x)$ has a global maximum at
  $x=-1$ and a global minimum at $x=1$?
</p>
<p>

  No we can't.  They both have a local maximum and minimum at those
  points since both functions increase on $(-\infty,-1)$, decrease on
  $(-1,1)$, and then increase again on $(1,\infty)$. But from the
  information we have gathered so far we can't tell if the graph of
  either function rises above its value at $x=-1$ or drops below its
  value at $x=1$ .
</p>
<p>

            
                  


  When we analyze $O_1(x)$ and $O_2(x)$ using the First Derivative
  Test we get exactly the same information from both functions. But
  they are very different functions. In particular, $O_1(x)$ does not
  have any global extrema, while $O_2(x)$ has both a global maximum
  and a global minimum. Graph them now and see.  To distinguish,
  analytically, between $O_1(x)$ and $O_2(x)$ we will need a new tool
  called the Second Derivative Test.
</p>
<p>



  But before we leave this example we need to address a small issue
  with our language.  The phrase ``$x$ gets farther from zero in the
  negative (or positive) direction so does $O_1(x)$'' is
  awkward\aside{It is also a bit imprecise for our purposes.}.  In
  future examples we will instead usually abbreviate these as: ``as
  $x$ goes to negative (or positive) infinity, $O_1(x)$ also goes to
  negative (or positive) infinity.'' Do not invest too much in these
  phrases.  They cannot possibly mean what they pretend to
  mean. ``Infinity'' is neither a number nor a place so it is
  meaningless to say that $x$ ``goes to'' infinity. Think of this as a
  kind of verbal shorthand, or notation.

<title>The Second Derivative Test</title>

<!-- \label{sec:conc-second-deriv} -->

<!-- \begin{wrapfigure}[7]{r}{1.6in} -->
<!--   \captionsetup{labelformat=empty} -->
<!--     \centerline{\includegraphics*[height=1in,width=1.6in]{../Figures/ConcaveUpDown1}} -->
<!--   \label{fig:ConcaveUp} -->
<!-- \end{wrapfigure} -->
<p>
Just as the First Derivative Test tells us whether
the graph of a function is increasing or decreasing, the Second
Derivative Test tells us whether the graph is <term>concave upward</term> or
<term>concave downward</term>.  We need to begin by explaining the meaning
of the phrases <term>concave upward</term> and <term>concave downward</term>.
</p>
<p>

The graphs at the right are illuminative. Loosely speaking concave
upward means ``like a bowl that opens up,'' and concave downward means
``like a bowl that opens down.''  However it is easy to get the wrong
impression from these simple examples. The graphs of the natural
exponential and the natural logarithm (seen below)
are also concave upward and concave downward, respectively. This is
true despite the fact that the exponential never turns up on the left,
and the logarithm never turns down on the right.
</p>

<image source="images/ExpLog2.png" width="60%" />
<!-- \centerline{\includegraphics*[height=2in,width=2in]{../Figures/ExpLog2}} -->


<image source="images/ConcaveUpDown.png" width="50%"/>
<!-- \begin{wrapfigure}[]{l}{1.5in} -->
<!--   \vskip-3mm  \captionsetup{labelformat=empty} -->
<!--   \centerline{\includegraphics*[height=.75in,width=1.5in]{../Figures/ConcaveUpDown}} -->
<!--   \label{fig:ConcaveUpDown} -->
<!-- \end{wrapfigure} -->
<p>

Nor is every graph always concave up or concave down.  We can see from
its graph at the left that the sine function is both concave upward
and concave downward. On the interval $(0,\pi)$ it is concave downward
and on the interval $(\pi,2\pi)$ it is concave upward. The concavity
of a graph, like the property of increasing and decreasing, depends on
the interval we are looking at.
</p>
<p>

Now what about these two functions?
</p>

<image source="images/ConcaveUpDownUnclear.png" width="60%" />
<!-- \centerline{\includegraphics*[height=1.5in,width=3in]{../Figures/ConcaveUpDownUnclear}} -->
<p>
The graph on the right appears to be concave up everywhere, but is it?
Can you tell from the graph what the concavity of either function is
near $x=0$?  If it is important for us to distinguish concave upward
from concave downward (it is), then clearly we will need a more
precise method than simply looking at graphs. We'll proceed carefully.
</p>

<image source="images/ConcaveUpWithTangent.png" width="50%"/>
<!-- \begin{wrapfigure}[9]{r}{3in} -->
<!--   \captionsetup{labelformat=empty} -->
<!--       \centerline{\includegraphics*[height=1.3in,width=3in]{../Figures/ConcaveUpWithTangent}} -->
<!--   \label{fig:ConcaveUpWithTangent} -->
<!-- \end{wrapfigure} -->
<p>
Since we're studying Calculus it seems likely that the derivative will
play an instrumental role, so let's see what we can say about the
derivative of a function whose graph is concave upward as shown at the
right.  In this example notice how the slope of the line tangent to
the graph (the derivative) changes as $x$ increases. At $x$ the
tangent line is horizontal (slope is zero), to the left of $x$ the
tangent line has negative slope and to the right it has positive
slope.  Speaking loosely, when the graph of a function is concave up
its the derivative increases as $x$ increases.
</p>
<exercise xml:id="no-label">
<statement>
<p>
  Does that mean that the derivative of a concave downward function
  will decrease as $x$ increases? Yes, of course it does.  Look back
  at the graphs of the other ``concave up'' and ``concave down''
  examples and convince yourself that this is true of them as well.
</p>
</statement>
</exercise>
<p>

Apparently in order to distinguish where a function is concave upward
from where it is concave downward we need to locate those intervals
where the derivative is increasing and where it is decreasing.  That
is, we need a tool that tells when some function (the derivative
function in this case) is increasing and when
it is decreasing.
</p>
<p>

But we already have that tool! It's called the First Derivative Test.
</p>
<p>

To find out where the graph of $y(x)$ is concave upward or concave
downward, we ask where its derivative, $\dfdx{y}{x}$, is increasing
and where it is decreasing. To find out where $\dfdx{y}{x}$ is
increasing and decreasing we ask where its derivative,
$\dfdxn{y}{x}{2}$, is positive and where it is negative.
</p>
<p>

The function $\dfdx{y}{x}$ will be increasing (meaning that $y(x)$ is
concave upward) wherever its derivative, $\dfdxn{y}{x}{2}$, is
positive. It will be decreasing ($y(x)$ is concave downward) wherever
its derivative, $\dfdxn{y}{x}{2}$, is negative.
</p>
<p>

So, to determine concavity of $y(x)$, we need to look at the sign of
its second derivative, $\dfdxn{y}{x}{2}$. More formally we have the
following theorem.
</p>

<theorem xml:id="thm:what-second-deriv">
  <title>Concavity</title>
  <p>
    <!-- \label{thm:what-second-deriv} -->
    Suppose $y=y(x)$ is a differentiable function of $x.$ The following
    statements are true:
    
    <ol>
      <li>
        <p>
          If $\eval{\dfdxn{y}{x}{2}}{x}{a}\gt 0$ on some open interval
          then $\dfdx{y}{x}$ is increasing, and therefore the graph of
          $y$ is concave upward on the interval.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          If $\eval{\dfdxn{y}{x}{2}}{x}{a}\lt 0$, on some open
          interval then $\dfdx{y}{x}$ is decreasing, and therefore the
          graph of $y$ is concave downward on the same interval.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ol>

  </p>
</theorem>




<example xml:id="no-label">
<p>
  Let $y=x^2.$ Then $\dfdx{y}{x}=2x,$ and $\dfdxn{y}{x}{2}=2.$ Since
  the second derivative of $y$ is always positive the graph must
  always be concave upward.
</p>
</example>

  <exercise xml:id="no-label">
<statement>
<p>
    Graph $y=x^2$ and verify that it is always concave upward.
  </p>
</statement>
</exercise>



<example xml:id="no-label">
<p>
  Let $y=x^3.$ Then $\dfdx{y}{x}=6x^2,$ and $\dfdxn{y}{x}{2}=3x.$
  Since the second derivative of $y$ is negative on the interval
  $(-\infty,0)$ the graph must be concave downward on for
  $x\lt0$. Since the second derivative of $y$ is positive on the
  interval $(0,\infty)$ the graph must be concave upward for $x\gt0$.
</p>
</example>

  <exercise xml:id="no-label">
<statement>
<p>
    Graph $y=x^3$ and verify that it is always concave downward on the
    interval $(-\infty, 0)$, and concave upward on the interval
    $(0,\infty)$.
  </p>
</statement>
</exercise>

<p>

Because we are applying the First Derivative Test to the first
derivative of $y(x)$ our language necessarily gets a little complex
here.  The point to remember is that we are ultimately interested in
what the first two derivatives, $\dfdx{y}{x}$ and $\dfdxn{y}{x}{2}$,
tell us about the graph of $y(x)$. We will define some vocabulary to
help us keep all of this clear.
</p>
<p>

We called the solutions of $\dfdx{y}{x}=0$ possible optimal transition
points (POTPs) because these are the places where the graph of $y(x)$
might transition between increasing and decreasing. So they are
possible local optimal points.
</p>
<p>

We will call the solutions of $\dfdxn{y}{x}{2}=0$ possible inflective
transition points (PITPs) because they are those places where the
<term>inflection</term> of the graph of $y(x)$ might transition between
concave upward and concave downward.

<p>

Part (c) of <xref ref="PROBLEMEvenFuncConcavity">Problem~\</xref> displays a very
useful fact about the second derivative.  At $ x=0$ the first
derivative of $y(x)=x^4-x^2$ is equal to zero, which means that the
line tangent at zero is horizontal. Also at $x=0$ the second
derivative is negative, which means that at $x=0$ the graph is concave
downward.  Taking these two facts together we can conclude that $y(x)$
must have a (local) maximum at $x=0.$
</p>
<p>

That is, for any curve $y(x)$, if
$$\dfdxat{y}{x}{a}=0 \text{ and } \eval{\dfdxn{y}{x}{2}}{x}{a}\lt0$$
then $y$ must have a (local) maximum at $x=0$. Similarly, for any

As you saw in <xref ref="DRILLSecondDerivativeTest">Drill\</xref> when the Second
Derivative Test works it can make quick work of many optimization
problems. But unfortunately part (c) of
<xref ref="THEOREMSecondDerivativeTest">Theorem</xref> is its
<url href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Achilles%27_heel" visual="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Achilles%27_heel">Achilles
  heel</url>. It is surprisingly common for both the first and second
derivative to be equal to zero at a POTP. When this happens the Second
Derivative Test cannot tell us whether it is an optimal point or not,
so we have to fall back on the First Derivative Test and analyze the
intervals between the the POTPs.

As we've said before, Calculus is merely one tool in your problem
solving toolbox. Moreover it is almost never the first tool you should
reach for.  You will frequently need to use your skills with Algebra,
Geometry, or Trigonometry to transform a problem into a form which
allows you to bring Calculus to bear on it.  You will need to take it
slowly, think clearly, and be careful. Frequently you will find that
your first first few ideas aren't working. When that happens, find
another idea and start again.
</p>
<p>

On the other hand you will often have a good deal of insight into
real-world problems because they are, well, real-world problems, and
you understand a lot about the real world.

<introduction>

<p>
So far in this chapter the examples and problems we've chosen we've
chosen emphasized the different aspects of optimization. Our intention
was to show you the subtleties involved one at a time so you could
understand them separately.
</p>
<p>
Of course, this is entirely unrealistic. Real problems rarely tell you
where the difficulties will lie, so in this final section we offer you
a selection of problems. It is up to you to
</p>
<p>
<ol>
  <li>
    <p>
      Find an appropriate objective function.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Identify the constraints.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Decide whether the natural domain of the problem consists closed  intervals or not.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Identify any POTPs.  If the problem domain consists only of closed intervals use  <xref ref="SECoptim-probl">Theorem</xref>. Otherwise use the First or the  Second Derivative Test.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Identify which, if any, of the POTPs are global optima.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Re-read the problem and confirm that you have solved it.  In the process of finding an optimum it is easy to lose track of the  question and stop too soon. Always make sure you have actually  solved the problem as stated.
    </p>
  </li>
</ol>
</p>
<p>
Recall that in <xref ref="EXfixed-perimeter">Example~\</xref> we observed that
most people can see intuitively that of all rectangles with a fixed
perimeter the one that encloses the greatest area will be a square. We
gave an algebraic demonstration of this in
<xref ref="CHAPTERScienceBeforeCalc">Chapter</xref> but now that we know how to
use Calculus to optimize let's revisit this problem.
</p>
<example xml:id="example:RectangleFixedPerimeter">
<title>Example~\#\ref{ex:fixed-perimeter} revisited again</title>
  <!-- \label{example:RectangleFixedPerimeter} -->
<p>
  We first solved this problem in <xref ref="EXfixed-perimeter">Example~\</xref>
  where we solved it algebraically.  We revisited it the first time in
  <xref ref="PROBLEMMaximalSquareRedux1">Problem~\</xref> where we solved it again
  analytically (using Calculus) twice. But to do this we relied on
  Fermat's Theorem and Fermat's Theorem only allows us to find a
  maximum that we already know exists. At that time we did not have
  the tools to show that we actually had a maximum. We do now so we
  will solve this problem one last time before we move on.
</p>
<p>
  Show that of all rectangles with a fixed perimeter, $P$,
  the one with the greatest area is a square.\\
</p>
      
<image source="images/PerimeterArea.png" width="60%" />
<!-- \centerline{\includegraphics*[height=1.3in,width=2.6in]{../Figures/PerimeterArea}} -->
<p>      
  We will follow the outline above.
</p>
<p>
<ol>
  <li>
    <p>
      The objective function is <me>
      \label{eq:FixedPerimeterObjective} A=xy, </me>
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      The only constraint is <me> \label{eq:FixedPerimeterConstraint}
      P=2x+2y </me> where $P$ is constant.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Since we are talking about a length it must be that
      $x\ge0$. From <xref
      ref="EQFixedPerimeterConstraint">Equation~</xref>) we see that
      $x$ must be less that or equal to $\frac{P}{2}$. Otherwise the
      perimeter will be greater than $P$. So the domain\aside{Strictly
      speaking if $x=0$ or $x=\frac{P}{2}$ we don't actually have a
      rectangle. But it is simpler to use the Extreme Value Theorem
      (<xref ref="THMmax-min">Theorem~\</xref>) than to find the
      increasing and decreasing intervals using the First Derivative
      Test. Since the Extreme Value Theorem requires a closed domain
      we make things simpler by allowing ``zero width'' rectangles.}
      of our problem is $0\le x\le \frac{P}{2}$.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Since the problem domain is a closed interval we will use the
      Extreme Value Theorem (<xref ref="THMmax-min">Theorem~\</xref>).
      To find the POTPs we will need $\dfdx{A}{x}$. From

<xref ref="EQFixedPerimeterObjective">Equation~</xref>) we see that    
<me>      \label{eq:MaxAreaDiffeq}      \dx{A}=x\dx{y}+y\dx{x}.    </me>
    </p>
<p>
    From <xref ref="EQFixedPerimeterConstraint">Equation~</xref>) we have    
<me>      \label{eq:FixedPerimeterDiffConstraint}      \dx{y}=-\dx{x}    </me>
    and also    
<me>      \label{eq:FixedPerimeterConstraintDiffeq}      y=\frac12\left(P-2x\right)    </me>

<p>
  This problem can be visualized as in the diagram at the left.  Since
  it is the printed area that is to be maximized it seems natural to
  label the width of the printed area, $x$, and the height, $y$, as
  shown. If we call the printed area $P_A$ then our objective function
  is,
  <me>
    P_A=xy.\label{eq:BookPage1}
</me>
</p>
<!--   The width of the entire page will be $x+2$, and the height will be -->
<!--   $y+3/2$. The area of each page is constrained to be $90$ square -->
<!--   centimeters so our constraint is, -->
<!--   <me> -->

<!--     \label{eq:BookPage2} -->
<!--     (x+2)(y+3/2)=90. -->
  
<!-- </me> -->
<!--   Differentiating <xref ref="EQBookPage1">Equation~</xref>) we see that -->
<!--   <me> -->

<!--     \label{eq:BookPage5} -->
<!--     \dx{(P_A)}=x{\color{red}{\dx{y}}}+{\color{blue}{y}}\dx{x} -->
  
<!-- </me> -->
<!--   Solving <xref ref="EQBookPage2">Equation~</xref>) for $y$ we have -->
<!--   <me> -->

<!--     \label{eq:BookPage3} -->
<!--     {\color{blue}{y=\frac{90}{x+2}-3/2}} -->
  
<!-- </me> -->
<!--   Differentiating <xref ref="EQBookPage2">Equation~\</xref> and solving for -->
<!--   $\dx{y}$ gives -->
<!-- $$ -->
<!-- {\color{red}{\dx{y}}=-\left(\frac{\textcolor{blue}{y}+3/2}{x+2}\right)\dx{x}}. -->
<!-- $$ -->
<!-- Substituting these into <xref ref="EQBookPage5">Equation~\</xref> we have -->
<!-- \begin{align*} -->
<!--       \dx{(P_A)}\amp =-x\textcolor{red}{\left(\frac{\textcolor{blue}{\frac{90}{x+2}-3/2}+3/2}{x+2}\right)}\dx{x}+\left(\textcolor{blue}{\frac{90}{x+2}-3/2}\right)\dx{x}. -->
<!--     \end{align*} -->
<!-- Since we'll have to set this equal to zero and to find any POTPs it is -->
<!-- clearly in our interest to reduce this algebraically to -->
<!-- \begin{align} -->
<!--   \dfdx{(P_A)}{x}\amp =\frac{-90x}{(x+2)^2}+\frac{90}{x+2}-3/2.\label{eq:BookPage4} -->
<!-- \end{align} -->
<!-- Adding the fractions we see that we must solve -->
<!-- $$ -->
<!-- \dfdx{(P_A)}{x}=\frac{-90x+90(x+2)-3/2(x+2)^2}{(x+2)^2}=\frac{180-3/2(x+2)^2}{(x+2)^2}=0. -->
<!-- $$ -->
<!-- At this point it is tempting to expand $(x+2)^2$, but recall that our -->
<!-- goal is to solve for $x$. Multiplying through by $(x+2)^2$ gives -->
<!-- $$ -->
<!-- 0=180-\frac{3}{2}(x+2)^2 -->
<!--   $$ -->
<!--   so that -->
<!--   $$ -->
<!--   (x+2)^2=120. -->
<!-- $$ -->
<!-- Solving this gives\aside{You can ``simplify'' $x=\pm\sqrt{120}-2$ to -->
<!--   $x=\pm2\sqrt{30}-2$ if you like, but there is no real advantage to -->
<!--   doing so. We prefer to leave it as $x=\pm\sqrt{120}-2$.  } -->
<!-- $x=\pm\sqrt{120}-2$. But the width of a page can't be negative so a -->
<!-- negative solution is meaningless for this problem.  Thus -->
<!-- $x=\sqrt{120}-2$ is our one and only POTP, and we conclude that we can -->
<!-- maximize the printed area by taking $x=\sqrt{120}-2\approx 8.95$ -->
<!-- centimeters. -->

<!-- That was a lot of work but we are not finished The problem asks us to -->
<!-- find the dimensions (plural) of the page.  To find $y$ we use -->
<!-- <xref ref="EQBookPage3">Equation~</xref>) to compute -->
<!-- $$y\approx\frac{90}{\sqrt{120}-2+2}-3/2 -->
<!-- =\frac{90}{\sqrt{120}}-3/2\approx 8.08.$$ -->

<!-- But we're still not finished. The problem asks for the dimensions of -->
<!-- the page, but we've only  found the dimensions of the printed -->
<!--   area. The dimensions of the page are -->
<!-- \begin{align*} -->
<!--   \text{Width of page} \amp  = \text{\textcolor{blue}{width of text}} + \text{\textcolor{red}{margins}} =\textcolor{blue}{\sqrt{120} -2} +\textcolor{red}{2} =\sqrt{120} \approx 10.95 \text{ cm}\\ -->
<!--   \text{Height of page} \amp = \text{\textcolor{blue}{height of -->
<!--   text}} + \text{\textcolor{red}{margins}} -->
<!--   =\textcolor{blue}{\frac{90}{\sqrt{120}}-3/2} + \textcolor{red}{3/2} -->
<!--   = \frac{90}{\sqrt{120}}\approx 8.22 \text{ cm}. -->
<!-- \end{align*} -->

<!-- Finally, the last item in our outline says to make sure we have done -->
<!-- everything that needs to be done to solve the problem. Have we? -->

<!-- No, clearly not. We never did step \#3: Identify the natural domain of -->
<!-- the problem. As a result we don't know for certain that we have a -->
<!-- maximum. It may be that the critical point we've identified is not in -->
<!-- the problem domain. It may be that it is in the domain, but that we -->
<!-- have a minimum instead of a maximum. Or that we have neither. The -->
<!-- point is that we can't know until we have found the natural domain of -->
<!-- the objective function, and verified that there is a global maximum at -->
<!-- $x=\sqrt{120}-2\approx8.95$ centimeters. -->

<!-- We mentioned earlier that the width of the page can't be negative so -->

<!-- You will find that, quite often, simplifying complex expressions as -->
