      Our purpose here is to give you our very best advice on how to
      succeed in this course and a realistic impression of the level
      of difficulty of the course material. Please read this carefully
      and take our advice. We know what we are talking about. Believe
      us.
    </p>
    <p>
      Because the topic we will be studying is called
      <term>Calculus</term> there is a strong tendency to assume that
      only the concepts and techniques of Calculus are needed to
      solve the problems you will encounter in this course. That is not
      true. You will need all of the mathematics you know. And probably
      more. Really.

    <title>Using Letters Instead of Numbers</title>

    <p>
      Before we begin, a few comments on notation are apropos.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suppose your teacher starts a lecture with the statement, <q>Suppose
      <m>a</m> and <m>b</m> are two positive numbers. Then <m>a \lt{} a+b</m> and
      <m>b \lt{} a+b</m>.</q> A common complaint is that we<rsq/>re making the problem
      harder. This is often accompanied with a request to replace <m>a</m> and
      <m>b</m> with numbers, just to make it easier to understand. For example,
      if <m>a</m> and <m>b</m> are numbers why not just say that <m>a</m> is <m>23</m> and <m>b</m>
      is <m>17</m>? In that case it is clear that <m>23 \lt{} 40\ (=23+17)</m> and
      <m>17 \lt{} 40</m>. Why do we have to make it more complicated?
    </p>

      <m>17 \lt{} 40</m>. Why do we have to make it more complicated?
    </p>
    <p>
      This seems like a reasonable point until you think about it a bit
      more. Suppose we use the numbers <m>a=\frac{\sqrt{11}-\pi}{4}</m> and
      <m>b=2.93\times 10^{1000}</m> instead? Is it obvious to you that
      <me>\frac{\sqrt{11}-\pi}{4}\lt{}\left(\frac{\sqrt{11}-\pi}{4}\right)+\left(2.93\times
      10^{1000}\right)</me> or
      <me>2.93\times
      10^{1000}\lt{}\left(\frac{\sqrt{11}-\pi}{4}\right)+\left(2.93\times
      10^{1000}\right)?</me>
    </p>

    <p>
      Our point here is that the symbol <m>a</m> is no different than the symbol
      <m>23</m>.  Or the symbol <m>\frac{\sqrt{11}-\pi}{4}</m>.  These are all valid
      symbols representing numbers. So we treat them all the same.
      For example, all of the following are valid statements:

      <md>
        <mrow>a+b &amp;= b+a</mrow>
        <mrow>  23+17 &amp;=17+23, \text{ and }</mrow>
        <mrow>        \left(\frac{\sqrt{11}-\pi}{4}\right) +\left(2.93\times 10^{1000}\right) &amp;= \left(2.93\times 10^{1000}\right) +\left(\frac{\sqrt{11}-\pi}{4}\right).
        </mrow>
      </md>

      The difference is this: If <m>a=23</m> and <m>b=17</m> the first statement
      includes the second as a specific case. Similarly if
      <m>a=\frac{(\sqrt{11}-\pi)}{4}</m> and <m>b=2.93\times 10^{1000}</m> the first
      statement includes the third.  The first statement is more
      general. It is true no matter what <m>a</m> and <m>b</m> are.

    <p>
      Keeping things simple is laudable as a goal and we don<rsq/>t want
      to suggest that you shouldn<rsq/>t do it.  It can be very useful to look
      at a special case of a general statement just to get a sense of the
      problem. For example, a good way to <q>trick yourself into
      abstraction</q> is to think <m>23</m> and <m>17</m>, but write
      down <m>a</m> and <m>b</m>.  As long as you don’t try to do anything that
      relies on the particular properties of <m>23</m> and <m>17</m>, you should be
      fine. But you wouldn’t want to say something like <m>a+b</m> is an even
      integer (even though <m>23+17</m> is). The sum <m>23+17</m> is an even integer
      because both <m>23</m> and <m>17</m> are odd integers, but this is special to
      these numbers and won<rsq/>t be true for <m>a</m> and <m>b</m> in general.
    </p>

    <problem>
      <task>
        <statement>
          <p>
            Suppose <m>a</m> and <m>b</m> are both integers.  Find restrictions
            on the possible values of <m>a</m> and <m>b</m> that will
            guarantee that <m>a+b</m> is an even, positive integer.
          </p>
        </statement>
      </task>
      <task>
        <statement>
          <p>
            Now suppose <m>a</m> and <m>b</m> are both numbers. Find restrictions
            on the possible values of <m>a</m> and <m>b</m> that will guarantee
            that <m>a+b</m> is an even, positive integer.  (This is not the same
          problem as part (a). Read it carefully.)
</p>
        </statement>
      </task>

    </problem>


    <p>    When looking at <m>23\times17</m> most people are inclined to compute
    this to get <m>391</m>. If the problem is: Find the value of
    <m>23\times17</m>, then sure, doing the arithmetic is the correct thing
    to do. But the last time you were asked to do multiplication for
    its own sake you were probably <m>11</m> years old. Elementary
    computations like this will only come up in the context of a
    more advanced problem.  Before doing this calculation, you should
    ask yourself if it will help you solve the more advanced problem.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now suppose the problem is: Determine  if the number
      <m>23\times17</m> is divisible by <m>17</m>. Do you see that computing
      <m>23\times17=391</m> will only make the problem harder?
    </p>
    <p>
      Your college professors will never ask you to do an arithmetic
      calculation for its own sake. Instead arithmetic problems will come up
      in the context of a more advanced problem and you will need to use
      your arithmetic skill to uncover patterns. But doing the arithmetic,
      boiling everything down to a single number usually hides the
      patterns!
    </p>
    <p>
      For example, is it easier to see the pattern in the following
      list of numbers when they are presented like this:
      <me>1, 2, 10, 110, 220, 1100, 12100, 24200, 121000, 1331000, \ldots </me>
      or like this:
      <me>(2^05^011^0), (2^15^011^0),
      (2^15^111^0), (2^15^111^1),
      (2^25^111^1),
      (2^25^211^1), (2^25^211^2), \ldots</me>.

    <p>
      It is a common misconception is mathematicians love complicated
      formulas. In fact, the opposite is true. We really very much prefer
      to keep things as simple as possible. We only accept complexity when
      we are forced to. Moreover, with experience we have learned that
      complexity is usually borne of an inadequate understanding of the
      problem.  Better understanding usually results in a simpler
      formulation.
    </p>

    <p>
      This works in reverse too. If we can find a simple way to express what
      appears to be a complex problem we can usually gain a deeper
      understanding of the problem and its solution. A judicious
      substitution is one way to re-express a complex problem.
    </p>

    <example xml:id="example-Sub1">
      <title>A Horrible Formula</title>
      <p>
        For example, suppose you were asked to solve the following
        equation for <m>x</m>:
        <me>
          \frac{\frac{\pi x}{\sqrt{(28-\sqrt[3]{26})^{\frac{1}{3}}}}}{\pi^2-\sqrt{3}}
          - \sqrt[21]{2^{\frac{11}{2}}}= (\pi^3-\sqrt{2})x.
        </me>
        At first glance this looks horribly complicated.  But look at it
        again.  On the right the coefficient of <m>x</m> is <m>\pi^3-\sqrt{2}.</m>
        That<rsq/>s just a number. It is approximately <m>29.6</m> but who cares? For
        purposes of algebraically isolating <m>x</m> all we need to know is that
        it is a number. Rather than calling it <m>\pi^3-\sqrt{2}</m>, let<rsq/>s
        just call it something simple, like <m>A</m>. Think of it as giving the
        expression <m>\pi^3-\sqrt{2}</m> a nickname; something shorter, and
        easier to remember.
      </p>
      <p>
        If we make that substitution our equation is now
        <me>
          \frac{\frac{\pi x}{\sqrt{(28-\sqrt[3]{26})^{\frac{1}{3}}}}}{\pi^2-\sqrt{3}}
          - \sqrt[21]{2^{\frac{11}{2}}}= Ax.
        </me>
        which is a bit <q>easier on the eyes.</q>
      </p>
      <p>
        But wait. The expression <m>\sqrt[21]{2^{\frac{11}{2}}}</m> is also just a
        number. Let<rsq/>s make it <q>easier on the eyes,</q> too. If we let
        <m>B=\sqrt[21]{2^{\frac{11}{2}}}</m> we have
        <me>
          \frac{\frac{\pi x}{\sqrt{(28-\sqrt[3]{26})^{\frac{1}{3}}}}}{\pi^2-\sqrt{3}}
          - B= Ax.
        </me>
        which is even easier to look at. By now you see where this is
        going. If we let
        <m>C=\frac{\frac{\pi}{\sqrt{(28-\sqrt[3]{26})^{\frac{1}{3}}}}}{\pi^2-\sqrt{3}}</m>
        then our equation is
        <m>
          Cx-B=Ax
        </m>
        which is much <q>easier on the eyes</q> than the original equation
        was. In fact, we can now see that this is really a very simple
        equation and the solution is <m>x=\frac{B}{C-A}</m>. Of course we
        inserted <m>A</m>, <m>B</m>, and <m>C</m> into the problem so now we
        need to unwind our substitutions. When we do that we get
        <me>
          x=\frac{\sqrt[21]{2^{\frac{11}{2}}}}{\frac{\frac{\pi}{\sqrt{(28-\sqrt[3]{26})^{\frac{1}{3}}}}}{\pi^2-\sqrt{3}}
          - (\pi^3-\sqrt{2})}.
        </me>
        If a decimal number is required we could enter this formula into
        whatever computational tool we<rsq/>re using. Good luck with that.
      </p>
    </example>


    <p>
      The previous example was clearly contrived.  Obviously we went
      out of our way to make a simple problem look complicated just so we
      could simplify it. As a result it would be easy to dismiss this as a
      silly example. But it is not. There is a serious lesson to be learned
      here. One that we will use over and over again in the near future.  By
      its very nature mathematical notation is not easy to read. It is so
      dense, with so much information packed into a few symbols, that it is
      easy to misinterpret. Making a formula easier to read can be very
      helpful.  A well chosen substitution can make a complex looking
      formula much easier to work with.
    </p>

    <example xml:id="example-Sub2">
      <p>
        When you were learning Algebra you almost certainly
        encountered problems like this: Given
        <men xml:id="EQQuadInForm1">

          x^{\frac{2}{3}}-4x^{\frac{1}{3}}+3=0
          
        </men>
        solve for <m>x</m>.
      </p>
      <p>
        At first glance, this looks like a formidable problem.  However, if
        we look closer we see that it actually has a very familiar
        form. Because <m>x^{\frac{2}{3}}=\left(x^{\frac{1}{3}}\right)^2</m> we
        can rewrite <xref ref="EQQuadInForm1">Equation</xref>) as
        
        <men xml:id="EQQuadInForm2">

          \left(x^{\frac{1}{3}}\right)^2-4x^{\frac{1}{3}}+3=0
          
        </men>
        and if you look closely you<rsq/>ll see that
        <xref ref="EQQuadInForm2">Equation~</xref>) is <q>quadratic in form.</q> That is,
        it is really a quadratic equation <mdash/> which we know how to solve <mdash/>
        in disguise. However it is still rather difficult to see the
        quadratic nature of <xref ref="EQQuadInForm2">Equation</xref>. To make this
        very clear we let
        <me>
          z=x^{\frac{1}{3}}.
        </me>
        That is, just as in <xref ref="example-Sub1">Example</xref> we give the
        expression <m>x^{\frac{1}{3}}</m> the nickname, <m>z</m>, which is shorter, easier to
        remember, and <q>easier on the eyes.</q> Then
        <xref ref="EQQuadInForm2">Equation</xref>) becomes the quadratic equation:
        <me>
          z^2-4z+3=0.
        </me>
        Our problem is not solved. Indeed, we haven<rsq/>t even tried to solve it
        yet.  But it is much more simply expressed. And because it is more
        simply expressed we can now see how to solve it.
        Factoring, we have
        <me>
          0=z^2-4z+3=(z-1)(z-3)
        </me>
        so we have <m>z=1</m> and <m>z=3</m>. But, of course, these are not
        solutions of our problem. We have found <m>z</m> (which we inserted
        into the problem) not <m>x</m> (which is what we need to find). To
        complete the solution we need to unwind the substitution we made and
        solve the two equations <me>x^{\frac{1}{3}}=1 \text{ and }
        x^{\frac{1}{3}}=3,</me> yielding the solutions <m>x=1</m> and
        <m>x=27</m>, respectively.
      </p>
    </example>

    <p>
      In making a substitution our goal is always to make the formulas we
      are dealing with simpler to understand and easier to read.  In
      <xref ref="example-Sub1">Examples</xref> <xref ref="example-Sub2">and</xref> it was
      straightforward
      to see how to do that.  There were expressions that were
      hard to read so we simply replaced a complicated part of the problem
      with something simple. It isn<rsq/>t always that easy.  Sometimes just
      finding a good substitution presents challenges of its own.
    </p>
    <aside><p><q>Straightforward</q> is not the same as
    <q>easy.</q></p>
    </aside>
    <p>
      For example,  the Quadratic Formula can be derived by making a very
      simple substitution that allows us to solve the general quadratic equation
      <men xml:id="EQQuadEq">
        ax^2+bx+c=0.
      </men>

      Once the substitution is found it is very easy to work through the
      algebra, but finding the right substitution in the first place is
      not straightforward at all.
    </p>

    <exercise xml:id="PROBLEMQuadSub1">
      <statement>

          <idx><h>Problem</h></idx>
          Before reading any further see if you can come up with the right
          substitution for <xref ref="EQQuadEq">Equation </xref>).
        </p>
      </statement>
      <hint>
        <p>
          The goal is to eliminate the linear term,
          <m>bx</m>. You can see how this would help. If <m>bx</m> were not present in
          <xref ref="EQQuadEq">Equation</xref> we could easily
          solve <m>ax^2+c=0.</m>
        </p>
      </hint>
    </exercise>

    <p>
      Were you able to solve <xref ref="PROBLEMQuadSub1">Problem</xref>?
      It<rsq/>s actually very hard to do without some guidance. Here<rsq/>s another
      hint. Try the substitution <m>x=y-\frac{b}{ka}</m> where <m>k</m> is
      a parameter to be determined.  That is, make this substitution and
      find the value of <m>k</m> that eliminates the linear term.
    </p>
    <p>
      After making this substitution the problem will be given in terms of
      <m>y</m>, not <m>x</m>. That<rsq/>s OK. Solve the problem in this form,
      and then unwind your substitution back to the original <m>x</m>
      variable.
    </p>

    <exercise>
      <statement>
        <p>
          <idx><h>Problem</h></idx> 

          Notice that after making our substitution we get: 
          <me>
            a\left(y-\frac{b}{k a}\right)^2+b\left(y-\frac{b}{k
            a}\right)+c=0.  
          </me> 
          which is more complicated, not less. Of course it is. Sometimes
          you have to complicate before you can simplify.  Don<rsq/>t give
          up. Multiply everything out to see what you<rsq/>ve got.  
          </p> 
          <p>
            Once you<rsq/>ve found <m>k</m> make the substitution and eliminate
            the linear term <mdash/> that was the objective, remember? At
            that point you should see the Quadratic Formula starting to
            emerge.  Don<rsq/>t forget to unwind the substitution and solve for
            <m>x</m>.

  We<rsq/>ve chosen the following example because it is neither particularly
  easy nor particularly difficult. It is typical of the kinds of
  medium level problems that appear in most Calculus textbooks.
</p>
<example xml:id="example-MaxTriangle">
<statement>
<p>
      The lengths of two sides of a triangle are <m>a</m> and <m>b</m>. If the third
      side is chosen in such a way that the area of the triangle is as
      large as possible what is the length of the third side?

</p>
<p>

  You may be able to intuit the correct answer to this problem. That<rsq/>s
  OK, but you should try to solve it, too. By <q>solve</q> we mean that you
  should be able to explain to someone with the same mathematical skills
  you have at the moment why your answer is correct.
</p>
<aside>
  <p>
    No, really. Give this problem a serious shot
    before you go on. It is not important that you
    succeed. Only that you try.
</p>
</aside>
<p>
  Before reading
  further do your best to solve this problem in <xref ref="example-MaxTriangle">Example</xref>. We<rsq/>ll wait.
</p>

<p>
  At first it is difficult to see where to begin. (That<rsq/>s why it<rsq/>s
  called a problem.)
  Don<rsq/>t let this stop you! In our experience the
  most common mistake is giving up too soon.
</p>

<p>Don<rsq/>t. Do. That.  Keep thinking.</p>
</statement>
<solution>
<title>Partial Solution</title>

<p>

  Since we know the lengths of the sides <m>a</m> and <m>b</m> of our triangle let<rsq/>s
  draw it. The sketch at the right would be typical. The question is,
  what length for side <m>c</m> makes the total area enclosed by the triangle
  as large as it can possibly be?
</p>
<p>

  Now what?
</p>
<p>

  Well, this looks like a right triangle doesn<rsq/>t it? If it is a right
  triangle, then we can find the length of <m>c</m> via the Pythagorean
  Theorem:
  <m>
    c=\sqrt{a^2+b^2},
</m>
right?
</p>
<p>

  Before you go on take a moment and really think about this
  problem. Can it really be that simple?
  Can you find any flaws
  in our reasoning.
</p>
<p>

  Once you think about it you see that we have no reason to believe that
  the triangle we seek must be a right triangle. It was completely
  accidental that we drew our diagram that way. If this seems like a
  simple-minded mistake, the sort of mistake that you would never make,
  be careful. It is a mistake to rely too heavily on the diagrams
  we draw. But it is an easy mistake to make, especially when the
  problems are more complicated, because as problems get complex we will
  need to rely on visualization more and more. This was not a dumb
  mistake. It was just a bit careless, and it is easy to be careless,
  especially when we first start thinking about a problem.

By definition, mistakes are wrong. A mistake is always obvious
after you recognize it as a mistake.  Everyone
makes mistakes in the course of solving a problem. The process of
making mistakes, recognizing them as mistakes, and figuring out why
they are mistakes is called learning.

  Making mistakes is how they got to be smart.
</p>
<p>

  Isaac Newton was once asked how he had been able to solve problems
  that no one before him had solved. His reply: <q>By thinking, and
  thinking, and thinking about them.</q> Of course, when he described
  his solutions he left out all of the errors like anyone would do,
  because, who cares about those? Making
  mistakes doesn<rsq/>t typically get the attention it deserves.   An expert is someone who has made every possible mistake. This is
  why your teacher, an expert, will seldom err.
</p>

<aside><p>And will be embarrassed
    when they do.</p>
</aside>
<p>
 Each mistake you make reflects the level of
  your current understanding of the problem. Each mistake you make
  takes you a little closer to expertise.  Embrace your mistakes
    and make lots of them!  They are proof that you are making
  progress.  But make no mistake (Gasp!) about it,  making and
  embracing a mistake is just the first step. You also have to figure
  out what went wrong.
</p>
<p>

  Sadly, mistakes are too often seen as a source of embarrassment. Too
  many students will berate themselves as stupid every time they make
  a mistake. Don<rsq/>t do that. It is pointless and counter-productive. All
  it will do is destroy your self confidence. Don<rsq/>t do it. Learning Calculus can be hard,
  but you would not have made it this far if you couldn<rsq/>t do
  it. So keep making mistakes. Ask
  for help when you need it. And don<rsq/>t give up.
  You have not failed until you stop trying.

</p>

<aside>
<p>
Did we mention that you shouldn<rsq/>t berate yourself when you make a
mistake?  You really shouldn<rsq/>t.
</p>
</aside>

</subsection>

<subsection> <title>Continuing our example</title>
<p> 
Let<rsq/>s look at this problem again.  The triangle we seek might look
like the first one we drew, or it might look like either of the ones
drawn in the diagram below, or myriad others. We simply don<rsq/>t have
enough information to decide at this point.
</p>

<image source="images/Advice3.png" width="30%" xml:id="figure-Advice3"/> <!-- \label{fig:Advice3} -->

<p>

But from the diagrams we<rsq/>ve drawn so far we can see that one end of
side <m>a</m> must be pinned to one end of side <m>b</m> and for each
angle between <m>a</m> and <m>b</m> we have a different possible
triangle.  We don<rsq/>t have to think of both of them as in motion. We can
think of one of them, say <m>b</m>, as fixed while the other swings
around their common endpoint. The circle in our diagram indicates all
of the possible positions <m>a</m>.
</p> 
<p>
Do you see how that worked? Our first attempt was simple-minded, but
by drawing our first, simple-minded sketch, making a stab at a
solution, and figuring out why our simple-minded approach won<rsq/>t work,
we were led to this insight: We can think of <m>b</m> as static, and
we can think of <m>a</m> as swinging freely while pinned to the end of
<m>b.</m>
</p>

<image source="images/Advice4.png" width="40%" xml:id="figure-Advice4"/> <!-- \label{fig:Advice4} -->

<p> 
Clearly we need to find the angle between <m>a</m> and <m>b</m>
<mdash/>- call it <m>\phi</m> as in the sketch at the right <mdash/>-
that maximizes the area of the triangle.  But which angle does that?
</p>
 <p>
   Whenever triangles are involved it is a good idea to recall your
   Trigonometry. After all, that<rsq/>s what Trigonometry is about, isn<rsq/>t
   it? Since we are thinking of <m>b</m> as fixed, we may as well use
   it as the base. This makes the height equal to <m>a\sin(\phi).</m>
   Also, since we<rsq/>re trying to maximize the area we should probably
   write down the area formula:
   <m>A=\frac12\text{(b)ase}\times\text{(h)eight}.</m> Thus the area
   of the triangle is <m>A=\frac{1}{2}ab\sin(\phi).</m>
</p>
<p>
  Is it clear that our initial guess was correct? The angle,
  <m>\phi,</m> that maximizes the area will be the one whose sine is
  as large as possible. That would be <m>\phi=90^\circ</m> so
  <m>c=\sqrt{a^2+b^2}</m> provides the maximum area. 
</p>
<p>
  You might be a little uncomfortable with our argument that
  <m>a\sin(\phi)</m> is maximized when <m>\phi=90^\circ</m>. If so,
  then for you, this problem is not finished. Possibly we<rsq/>ve made a
  mistake. Let<rsq/>s follow our own advice and see why it is a mistake, if
  it is.
</p>
<exercise xml:id="exercise-">
<statement>
<p>
<idx><h>Problem</h></idx>
Replace <m>a\sin(\phi)</m> with <m>h</m> in
  the diagram above. Use the Pythagorean Theorem to reason that if
  <m>\phi\lt{}90^\circ</m> then <m>h\lt{}a</m>. How does this apply to
  the problem of maximizing the area of the triangle?
</p>
</statement>
</exercise>

 <p>
   Until we can demonstrate that <m>c=\sqrt{a^2+b^2}</m> with a
   convincing and rigorous argument, this problem is not
   solved. Instead it is only a conjecture; an educated guess. Our
   evidence so far is very convincing so it is a very well educated
   guess, but it is still only a guess.

<p>
  In order to solve a problem, any problem, you must:
  <dl>
    <li>
      <title>Have an idea</title>
      <p>
        Solving a mathematical problem is a bit like
        getting dropped in the woods without a map or any GPS technology and
        being told to find your way out. First you have to find a path. Once a path is found, you
        have to follow it. Nothing else really has a chance of working.
        Following your path will eventually lead you to another path. Now
        you have to decide which path to follow, so you look around and make
        your best guess. If you guess right, great! If not you will have to
        backtrack and take the other path. And so it
        goes. Guess. Backtrack. Guess again. As you learn the terrain and
        get familiar with the network of paths your guesses get
        better.  Sometimes none
        of the paths you<rsq/>ve found seem to be getting you closer to your
        destination. So you have to try something different, like getting
        off of the path completely.
      </p>
      <p>

        Eventually you<rsq/>ll get where you<rsq/>re going but the one thing you can<rsq/>t
        do is give up. You will never get anywhere if you don<rsq/>t keep trying.
      </p>
      <p>

        Having an idea is like following a path in the woods. It<rsq/>s a start,
        but that<rsq/>s all it is. You still have to follow it. After you<rsq/>ve
        taken it as far as you can you need to look for another idea; a new
        path to follow.
      </p>
      <p>
        Finding your way out of the woods takes patience, diligence, and a
        lot of hard work. So does solving a mathematics problem.  Except, of
        course, that you won<rsq/>t die of exposure if you don<rsq/>t solve the math
        problem.
      </p>


      <p>

        If an idea occurs to you, follow it. Most likely you will not hit on
        a good, or even a workable approach the first time. Or the first
        three times. That<rsq/>s OK. Keep thinking about the problem anyway. It
        is frustrating and it doesn<rsq/>t feel like progress, but it is. As long
        as you are having and discarding ideas you are making progress.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <title>Really, have an idea. If you don<rsq/>t have a good idea, then use a bad one.</title>
<p> 
 OK, we hear you say, but what if I don<rsq/>t have any good
  ideas? What do I do then?
</p>
<p>

  Easy. Use a not-so-good idea.
</p>
<p>

  This is what you<rsq/>ve been doing all of your life anyway isn<rsq/>t it?
  You just didn<rsq/>t tell anyone because you were sure you were doing
  something wrong, right?  You weren<rsq/>t.
</p>
<p>

  The most important thing you can do is get started. That<rsq/>s what
  having an idea is for, getting started. All we did to start the
  problem in <xref ref="example-MaxTriangle">Example</xref> was draw the
  lines <m>a</m> and <m>b.</m> Look back up at  our partial solution and
  see. The first thing we did was make the drawing below:

</p>

  <image  source="images/Advice1.png" width="30%" />


<p>
  Can you think of anything more simple-minded? And yet it worked. It
  didn<rsq/>t work right away, but it got us moving in the right direction.
</p>
    </li>
<li>
<title>Have another idea.</title>
<p>Because this is a textbook we couldn<rsq/>t
  really waste time and pages by running down blind alleys, so we
  started off with an idea that we knew would take us in the right
  direction. In real life this usually won<rsq/>t happen. Most often your
  first (two or three or four) ideas aren<rsq/>t going to take you in the right
  direction. That<rsq/>s OK. Figure out what is wrong with them. You had
  some intuition about the problem that led you to your
  idea. Figuring out why it didn<rsq/>t work will clarify things for you
  just a bit. That will help.
</p>
<p>

  So, have another idea that is based on what you learned from your
  first idea. And another. And another after that. Keep having ideas
  until you find one that works. Another way to say this
  is: Don<rsq/>t give up.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<title>Ask for help when you get stuck, not before.</title>
<p>
Sometimes ideas
  just won<rsq/>t come to you. That<rsq/>s OK. Sometimes you will need help. Ask
  for it. Ask your teacher, another student, a tutor, your Mom, your
  Dad, a former teacher.
  Ask. For. Help.
</p>
<p>

  But ask constructively. If you are asking another student, a peer,
  it is fine to ask, <q>How do I do this problem?</q> But if you are
  asking your teacher, or a tutor, this sounds a lot like, <q>This
  problem looks hard, my friends are meeting up in half an hour and,
  besides, I don<rsq/>t really want to spend any more time on it. Please,
  do this problem and let me watch so I can turn it in and go have
  fun with my friends.</q> This is not
  usually effective. Moreover some teachers will get a little testy
  about it. Instead ask something like, <q>I<rsq/>ve tried this, and this,
  and this, but I keep getting stuck here. Can you give me some
  direction?</q>  That shows that you have already put real effort into
  solving the problem and are willing to continue working on it.
</p>
<p>To be clear, your teacher knows that
    a serious student does not mean this, that you really just want
    to learn how to do the problem. The difficulty is that there are
    always some students who have no qualms about asking their
    instructor to do problem after problem with no intention of
    learning anything. They just want to copy the answers down and
    quit. Teachers quickly learn to identify these students from the
    way they ask questions. If you approach your instructor in the
    same fashion that a non-serious student does the response you
    get won<rsq/>t be as helpful as you would like.
    Teachers <em>want</em> to help serious students, but non-serious
    students are a waste of time. Be a serious student. Just as
    importantly, <em>act</em> like a serious student.
</p>

<p>

  Or, if you find the problem so mystifying that you can<rsq/>t even
  think of a first idea ask, <q>I really don<rsq/>t know where to begin on
  this problem. Can you point me in the right direction to get me
  started?</q>
</p>
</li>
<li>
<title>Keep thinking about the problem after you solve it.</title>

After you<rsq/>ve solved a problem, pause for a moment, take
a sip of coffee, or tea, or whatever and think about
the problem you just solved. This is like the difference between looking
at a mountain from its base, when all you can see is the tangle of
brush in your way, and looking at it from the peak. From the peak all
of the obstacles you overcame getting there look small and
unimportant. You can see the broad outlines of the mountain and the
path you took climbing it. Frequently you will also see a better path
than the one you took.

This kind of reflection is the most neglected aspect of problem
solving. After you<rsq/>ve been struggling with a problem you probably
don<rsq/>t ever want to see it again.  This is a natural response.
However, before you put the problem away reflect on your solution and
make this part of your knowledge base. Think about which ideas you had
that worked, and which ideas you had that didn<rsq/>t work. Think about why
they did, or didn<rsq/>t work. Do this immediately, while the problem is
still in your mind. Later, if something reminds you of this problem,
think about it some more to see why you were reminded of it.
</p>
<p>

The difference between the teacher and the student is not
intelligence, but experience.  The more problems you solve, the more
experience you gain. But you need to be able to use that experience
for subsequent problems. Reflecting on a problem after you solve it is
how you make the knowledge you gained from the problem available for
later use.

For example, see if you can use what you learned from the triangle
problem to solve <xref ref="drill-MaxPara"></xref>.

<title>Use your intuition, but don<rsq/>t trust it.</title>
<p>Finally, because many problems in Calculus are about motion and you
are very familiar with how things move, you will often have a good deal
of intuition into their solution. Paradoxically you need to learn to
use, but not to trust, your intuition.
</p>
<p>

When approaching a problem intuitively, there is a tendency to add
assumptions to familiar looking problems. Notice how easy it was to
believe that our triangle must be a right triangle just because our
first drawing looked like a right triangle.
</p>
<p>

As we said, you will have some intuition into many problems, and
intuition can be very helpful, but it can also lead you astray. You
need to learn to support your intuition with reasoning.

  You will probably have a strong insight, or intuition, about each of
  the following claims. Do your best to explain why each is true, or why it is
  false. Read each problem carefully and take care not to add
  assumptions that are not in the problem. Back up your claim with
  reasoning, not intuition.
