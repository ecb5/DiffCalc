Like the authors, your instructor is probably a highly trained,
professional mathematician. As mathematicians we solve problems and we
build logical structures. This is what we were trained to do.
</p>
<p>

The structures we build are what makes mathematics useful but that is
not why we build them. Most of the time we create simply for the love
of the creative act itself. Usefulness, as such, is often a secondary
consideration. In this, mathematicians are more like poets or artists
than scientists or engineers. By and large, we consider the act of
creation to be its own reward\aside{This is why mathematicians
  sometimes seem to be out of touch with the real world. Much like
  poets and artists, when we are doing mathematics we actually are out
  of touch, at least a little.}. It is a remarkable fact that
sometimes the logical structures we build turn out to be applicable to
problems in the real world.
</p>
<p>


When we explain our mathematical works to each other we mathematicians
only display the finished product in much the same way that an artist
or an architect will display their work without all of the
behind-the-scenes sketches and pencil lines (and mistakes), that they
made along the way.  We start with simple ideas and bit by bit, piece
by piece, we assemble our mathematics like we would a puzzle. When we
explain it to others we ignore all of the mistakes we made along the
way for the same reason that artists do.  They are not part the
finished product. That is how we understand, and think about our
mathematics, and that is how we talk to each other about it. Displayed
in this manner a mathematical structure is truly as beautiful as any
artistic creation.
</p>
<p>


But in this text we are not talking to other mathematicians. We are
talking to you, a mathematics student. And you are (presumably)
encountering Calculus for the first time. This is not the time to
build Calculus up from its logical foundations and expect you to
appreciate its beauty.  This is the time to show you where Calculus
came from, how it was built, what problems it was invented to solve,
and, perhaps most importantly, how well Calculus addresses those
problems. Once that is done you will appreciate it, or not, as your
own sense of aesthetics allows.
</p>
<p>

As you proceed through this text know that it took several centuries
for some of the most brilliant persons who have ever lived to polish
the ideas of Calculus to their current luster. But just as a painting
is unappealing before it is finished, Calculus is not lustrous until
you can look back on it as a whole. Until then it takes a lot of
calculation and thought to see how the ideas work together. In the
end, we hope you will come to see that it is worth all of the work and
frustration.
</p>
<p>

In this chapter we will be exploring the <foreign>ad hoc</foreign> techniques
used by the mathematical pioneers who were trying to solve some very
real and very specific problems using only the tools that you possess
now: Geometry, Algebra, and Trigonometry. The pre-Calculus techniques
they came up with substantially influenced the form that Calculus
eventually took. If the pioneers had been different people, or if they
had begun with different tools Calculus would likely have taken a
different form. Or it might not have been invented at all. The
pre-Calculus methods we will see in this chapter represent the first
ideas that eventually led to Calculus. The supporting logical
structure came later, much later.
</p>
<p>

Thus we will begin with the intuitive notions that preceded
Calculus. But we will not hide the problems inherent in this
approach. Quite the reverse. It is our intention to highlight them as
much as possible. The underlying difficulties are real and they need
to be understood. We want you to be aware of them so that in
<xref ref="CHAPTwhats-wrong-with">Chapter</xref> when we begin to address them,
the necessity of the rather severe formalism we are forced to adopt
will be clear to you.
</p>
<p>


For example, we will soon start talking about ``the line tangent to a
curve.''  You have a very clear image of what is meant by ``tangent
line'' and that will suffice to begin.  But, it is actually very hard
to define precisely what we mean by ``the line tangent to a
curve\aside{You almost certainly don't believe this because nothing
  could be clearer than the image of tangency you have in your
  head. Nevertheless we will eventually see that it is true.}.''
</p>
<p>

Later we will encounter a similar difficulty with the idea of a
continuous curve. The phrase ``continuous curve'' surely conjures up a
very clear image in your mind. Nothing could be clearer
really. Continuous curves are unbroken curves, right? This is so
intuitively obvious that mathematicians did not bother to define it
formally for millennia. Most likely you don't see the need for a
formal definition either. Yet.  But ``continuity'' is very hard to
define in a mathematically rigorous manner. The first person to give a
rigorous definition in the modern sense
was
<url href="https://mathshistory.st-andrews.ac.uk/Biographies/Bolzano/" visual="https://mathshistory.st-andrews.ac.uk/Biographies/Bolzano/">Bernhard
  Bolzano</url> in 1817.
</p>

<!-- \end{wrapfigure} -->
<p>

One of our goals is to set up the conditions under which it will
become very clear to you why your intuitive image of a ``tangent
line,'' or a ``continuous curve'' is not sufficient; why these are
hard concepts to define. We want you to bump into the difficulties
that come with the intuitive understanding you have right now so that
you will see -- and appreciate -- why the definitions we will
eventually be offering are better. Or at least more useful.
</p>
<p>

But have some sympathy for the poor instructor! Everything we do in
the first part of this text, especially in this section, goes directly
against all of the instructor's training as a
mathematician\aside{Indeed, it may well go against your own
  sensibilities as well. If you find yourself getting irritated with
  the imprecision of our presentation you may well be a mathematician
  yourself, at least by temperament. In that case, all you lack is
  training and you can get that by changing your
  major to mathematics. Think about it.
  If you are not a mathematician at heart then this first part of the
  text is the part you will probably find most useful and
  interesting. This is where we will try to elucidate the most
  powerful problem solving tools that came from Calculus and show you
  how to use them. But the problems are only representative. Pay
  attention to the techniques, not to the problems themselves.}.
Instructors would be much happier with us if we would define the terms
``the line tangent to a curve'' and ``continuous curve'' before we use
them because that is the way they see and appreciate the beauty of our
topic.
</p>
<p>

The problem is that this is not (in our opinion) a good way to learn
Calculus. So we will be following in the footsteps of our
forebears. We will proceed using intuitive ideas until they become too
unwieldy to use. Only after we have found the properties we need from
a concept (like ``tangent'') will we offer formal
definitions. Hopefully it will then be clear to you why the
definitions are needed, and why they are stated as they are.

<p>So to the instructor, or anyone else of a mathematical bent who might
be reading this, we offer our apologies for proceeding in what we know
looks like the wrong way around. As mathematicians ourselves we
certainly feel the same discomfort you do. But in this text we are not
writing as mathematicians for other mathematicians, we are writing as
teachers for students. Please bear with

<!--  <title>The Laziness of Nature</title> -->

<!-- <!-\- \label{SEClaziness-nature} -\-> -->


<!-- In order to apply mathematical principles to the study of physical -->
<!-- phenomena we need to agree on some foundational assumptions which seem -->
<!-- to govern the behavior of nature.  A fundamental tenet that scientists -->
<!-- use is this: <em>Nature is lazy!</em>  That is, nature optimizes. It -->
<!-- tries to do things in the most efficient (optimal) manner -->
<!-- possible. The most common form such <term>Optimization Problems</term> take -->
<!-- is to find the value of the independent variable (often denoted $x$) -->
<!-- which makes the dependent variable (often denoted $y$) as large or as -->
<!-- small as possible. -->


<!-- To illustrate the usefulness of this principle consider a beam of -->
<!-- light bouncing off of a flat mirror. Empirical evidence\aside{That is, -->
<!--   evidence gained from measuring the angles.} suggests that the angle -->
<!-- of incidence is equal to the angle of reflection. However, no matter -->
<!-- how many experiments we run there is always the chance that there is -->
<!-- some configuration of lights and mirrors we've missed. A configuration -->
<!-- where the angles are not equal. -->

<!-- Let's try a thought experiment\aside{This means that we'll think about -->
<!--   it.}. -->


<!-- We want to discover what path a beam of light would travel between the -->
<!-- points $A$ and $B$ in the figure below assuming that it first reflects -->
<!-- off of the line $m$ ($m$ for mirror, not slope). -->
<!-- \centerline{\includegraphics*[height=1in,width=4in]{../Figures/ReflectingMirror1}} -->

<!-- From our assumption that <em>Nature is Lazy</em>, it is clear that our -->
<!-- task is to find the shortest path\aside{Actually we want to minimize -->
<!--   the amount of time it takes to pass between two points, but for this -->
<!--   problem minimizing the time and minimizing the distance are -->
<!--   equivalent. The modern name for this idea is the ``Principle of -->
<!--   Least Action.''} from $A$ to $m$ to $B.$ That is, we have an -->
<!-- <term>Optimization Problem.</term> -->

<!-- Begin by reflecting $B$ across $m$ in our imagination and -->
<!-- denote this reflection by $B_R.$ -->
<!-- \centerline{\includegraphics*[height=.8in,width=2.4in]{../Figures/ReflectingMirror2}} -->
<!-- Clearly if the mirror were not present then the solid line from $A$ to -->
<!-- $B_R$ in the figure above will be shorter than any other path from $A$ -->
<!-- to $B_R$. For example it is shorter than the dotted path from $A$ to -->
<!-- $B_R$. -->

<!-- Next we reflect $B_R$ back across $m$ so that it falls onto $B$, and -->
<!-- we reflect those portions of the solid and -->
<!-- dotted paths that are below line $m$, in the same way. -->
<!-- \centerline{\includegraphics*[height=.8in,width=2.4in]{../Figures/ReflectingMirror3}} -->
<!-- Since the two dotted paths have equal lengths, and the two solid paths -->
<!-- have equal length it is clear that the solid path from $A$ to $m$ to -->
<!-- $B$ is shorter than the dotted path from $A$ to $m$ to $B$, and is -->
<!-- thus the shortest possible path from $A$ to $m$ to $B$. -->

<!-- \begin{embeddedproblem}{} -->
<!--   Suppose we label the angles in the previous diagram as -->
<!--   follows: -->
<!--   \centerline{\includegraphics*[height=1.3in,width=3in]{../Figures/ReflectingMirror7}} -->
<!--   % Show that -->
<!--   \begin{enumerate}[label={\bf{}(\alph*)}]{} -->
<!--     % \begin{multicols}{3} -->
<!--   \item Explain why $\angle\gamma=\angle\beta$. -->
<!--   \item Explain why $\angle\gamma=\angle\alpha$. -->
<!--   \item And finally, conclude that $\angle\alpha=\angle\beta$. -->
<!--     % \end{multicols} -->
<!--   \end{enumerate} -->
<!-- \end{embeddedproblem} -->

<!-- Thus the angle of incidence -->

<!-- <title>Maximizing Area</title> -->

<!--   \label{ex:fixed-perimeter} -->
<!--   Out of all rectangles with a given fixed perimeter, which one -->
<!--   encompasses the greatest area? -->
  
<!--   A reasonable guess is that the correct shape is a square. But a -->
<!--   guess, no matter how much it feels right, is just a guess. We need a -->
<!--   convincing demonstration. -->
  
<!--   To see that this actually is the correct shape, consider a square -->
<!--   whose side is $s.$ If $s$ is the length of one side then the -->
<!--   perimeter of our square is (the fixed value) $4s$ and the area is -->
<!--   $s^2$ (also fixed). Suppose we now increase of two opposite sides -->
<!--   the length by $x.$ To maintain the same perimeter, we must now -->
<!--   decrease the width by the same $x.$ The area of this new rectangle -->
<!--   is $(s-x) \times (s+x)$ is $(s-x)(s+x)=s^2-x^2\lt{}s^2$ but its -->
<!--   perimeter is still $4s.$ -->
  
<!--   Thus the square has a larger area than this rectangle with the same -->
<!--   perimeter. Moreover, since we didn't specify a value for $x$ our -->
<!--   conclusion holds for all possible values of $x$. That is, every -->
<!--   rectangle with perimeter $4s$ has a smaller area than the square -->
<!--   with perimeter $4s$. -->
<!-- </example> -->


<!-- \begin{Digression}[Variables, Constants, and Functions] -->
<!--   <!-\- \label{digress:VarConFun} -\->{} -->
<!--   It is easy to have the impression that using a letter, like $s$, to -->
<!--   represent quantity automatically means that the quantity can vary -\- -->
<!--   that it is ``variable.'' This is not true.  There are three -->
<!--   situations in which which a letter is used to represent a given -->
<!--   quantity. -->
  
<!--   \begin{description} -->
<!--   \item [Variables:] For example, the area of a square is given by -->
<!--     $A=x^2,$ where $x$ is the length of one side.  If we think of $x$ -->
<!--     as a <term>variable</term> -\-\- if it can take on any positive value -\-\- -->
<!--     then this expression gives us the area of all possible squares. -->
<!--   \item[Constants:] Sometimes letters are used to designate unchanging -->
<!--     quantities -\-\- <term>constants</term> (also called <term>parameters</term>) -->
<!--     -\-\- when the actual value of the constant is irrelevant. For -->
<!--     example, the area of all rectangles where one side is some fixed -->
<!--     value, say $c$, but the other varies is given by $A = c\cdot x,$ -->
<!--     where $x$ is variable as before. Since we don't care what the size -->
<!--     of the fixed side is we don't choose a specific length for it. We -->
<!--     just let $c$ represent that fixed size, whatever it is.  The -->
<!--     crucial fact here is that we have a rectangle, not what size the -->
<!--     rectangle is. -->
    
<!--     The difference between <term>variables</term> and <term>constants</term> is -->
<!--     mostly in the way we think about them. Constants are fixed, but -->
<!--     unknown. Variables are not fixed. -->
<!--   \item[Functions:] Sometimes a varying quantity depends on the values -->
<!--     of one or more other varying quantities. In that case the -->
<!--     dependent variable is said to be a <term>function</term> of the -->
<!--     independent variable. We saw this above when we said the area of a -->
<!--     rectangle with a fixed side length, $c$, was -->
<!--     $$ -->
<!--     A=c\cdot x. -->
<!--     $$ -->
<!--     Most often we would write this as -->
<!--     $$ -->
<!--     A(x)=c\cdot x. -->
<!--     $$ -->
<!--     The ``$(x)$'' part of ``$A(x)$'' just tells us that what the -->
<!--     dependent variable $A$ depends on is the independent -->
<!--     variable\aside{If you are inclined to be persnickety, you can make -->
<!--       a reasonable argument that if $A(x)=cx$ then $A$ depends on both -->
<!--       $c$ and $x$. And you'd be right. But the tradition is to only -->
<!--       put variables inside the parentheses, not parameters.} $x$. -->
<!--     % The name we give to the dependent variable ( $A$ in this case) -->
<!--     % usually serves double duty as both the name of the dependent -->
<!--     % variable, and the name of are also sometimes called -->
<!--     % functions. In this example $A$ is a <em>function</em> of $x$. -->
    
<!--   \end{description} -->
<!--   These are simple distinctions now, but it will be useful for you to -->
<!--   get in the habit of making sure it is clear in your mind what is -->
<!--   variable, what is constant, and which variables are functions of -->
<!--   other variables. As the problems get more complex and we need -->
<!--   several variables, parameters, and functions, just untangling all of -->
<!--   this can become problematic. Keep in mind that the distinction is -->
<!--   purely in how we choose to ``think about'' a given symbol, not in -->
<!--   how we manipulate it algebraically. -->

<!-- what about the following? -->

<!-- <example xml:id="science-before-calc-2}"> -->

<!--   Consider all square based boxes with a fixed surface area $S.$ Does -->
<!--   the cube enclose the largest volume? -->
  
<!--   To do this problem in the same manner as -->
<!--   Example~\ref{ex:fixed-perimeter}, observe that a cube with side $s$ -->
<!--   would have a volume of $s^3$ and a surface area of $6s^2$. Suppose -->
<!--   we change the lengths on the base from $s$ to $s+x$.  Notice that if -->
<!--   $x\gt0$ then we will be increasing the lengths on the base and if -->
<!--   $x\lt0$ then we will be decreasing the lengths.  The only -->
<!--   restriction is that $0\lt s+x$ so as to be a length.  This says that -->
<!--   $-s\lt x\lt\infty$. (In theory, we can make the lengths of the base -->
<!--   as long as we wish.)  To maintain a surface area of $6s^2$, we will -->
<!--   need to adjust our height appropriately.  Let’s call this new height -->
<!--   $h$. -->
  
<!--   \begin{embeddedproblem} -->
<!--     \label{problem:MaximalCube1} -->
<!--     Proceed as in Example~\ref{prob:science-before-calc-2} to show -->
<!--     that in order to maintain a surface area of $6s^2$, $h$ must be -->
<!--     $ h=\frac{s^2-sx-\frac{x^2}{2}}{s+x}$. Use this to show that the -->
<!--     volume of this new box is -->
<!--     $$ -->
<!--     V=s^3-x^2\left(s+\frac{s+x}{2}\right). -->
<!--     $$ -->
<!--     How does this address the original question about the cube having -->
<!--     the largest volume?  -->
<!--     \hint{ Why did we write $V$ in this rather peculiar way.} -->
<!--   \end{embeddedproblem} -->

<!-- <xref ref="PROBLEMMaximalCube1">Problem</xref> shows that proceeding in this -->

<!--   In Example~\ref{ex:fixed-perimeter}, we showed that out of all -->
<!--   rectangles with a fixed perimeter, the one with the largest area is -->
<!--   a square. Next we will use Fermat's Method of Adequality to examine -->
<!--   the related question: Out of all rectangles with a fixed area, does -->
<!--   a square have the smallest perimeter? -->
  
<!--   Consider a rectangle whose length is given by $x$ and width is given -->
<!--   by $y.$ The area of the rectangle is given by $A=xy$ and the -->
<!--   perimeter is given by $P=2x+2y.$ -->
  
<!--   The problem is to minimize $P$ while holding $A$ constant. More -->
<!--   precisely, our objective is to minimize the function $P=2x+2y$, -->
<!--   subject to the constraint that the area, $A=xy$, is fixed. First, we -->
<!--   will use our constraint $A=xy$ to eliminate one of the variables and -->
<!--   substitute into $P$. Solving for $y,$ we get $y=A/x.$ Then, -->
<!--   $$ -->
<!--   P=P(x) = 2x+\frac{2A}{x}. -->
<!--   $$ -->
<!--   We have used function notation for $P(x)$ to emphasize that $P$ is a -->
<!--   function of $x$ alone.  (Remember that $A$ is constant or -->
<!--   ``fixed.'') -->
  
<!--   Fermat's method says to first set -->
<!--   $$ -->
<!--   P(x+h)=P(x). -->
<!--   $$ -->
<!--   This gives: -->
<!--   \begin{align} -->
<!--     2(\textcolor{red}{x}+h)+\frac{2A}{x+h}=2\textcolor{red}{x}+\frac{2A}{x}.\label{equation:FermAd1} -->
<!--     \intertext{  Rearranging a bit, we get} -->
<!--     \nonumber -->
<!--     \textcolor{red}{2x}+\textcolor{blue}{2}h+\frac{\textcolor{blue}{2}A}{x+h}&=\textcolor{red}{2x}+\frac{\textcolor{blue}{2}A}{x} -->
    
<!--     \intertext{so that} -->
<!--     \nonumber h&=\frac{A}{x}-\frac{A}{x+h}.  -->
<!--     \intertext{Adding the fractions gives} -->
<!--     h&=\frac{A(x+h)-Ax}{x(x+h)}=\frac{Ah}{x(x+h)}. \label{equation:FermAd6} -->
<!--     \intertext{Finally, and crucially, dividing both sides   by $h,$ gives}    -->
<!--     1&=\frac{A}{x(x+h)}.\label{equation:FermAd7} -->
<!--   \end{align} -->
  
<!--   Earlier we had made the ``mistake'' of setting $P(x+h)=P(x)$ -->
<!--   (knowing that this is not true). Now we ``make it correct'' by -->
<!--   setting $h=0$. This gives: $ 1=\frac{A}{x^2}, \text{ or } x^2=A.  $ -->
<!--   Substituting this into $y=\frac{A}{x},$ we get -->
<!--   $y=\frac{A}{x}=\frac{x^2}{x}=x.$ -->
  
<!--   Thus $P$ is minimum when $y=x,$ which is to say, when the rectangle -->
<!--   is actually a square. A moment's thought should make it clear that -->
<!--   there is no maximum value for $P.$ -->
  
  
<!--   Fermat's method is very slick.  However it contains an inherent -->
<!--   logical flaw.  We begin by setting $P(x+h)$ equal to $P(x)$, even -->
<!--   though we know we are making an error. This seems like it might be a -->
<!--   flaw but it really isn't. When we set $P(x+h)=P(x)$ we are asking, -->
<!--   ``What happens if they are equal?'' The computations leading up to -->
<!--   equation~(\ref{equation:FermAd7}) are the answer to that question. -->
  
<!--   But notice that we got from equation~(\ref{equation:FermAd6}) to -->
<!--   equation~(\ref{equation:FermAd7}) by dividing by $h.$ From -->
<!--   arithmetic you know that you can only divide by $h$ if $h$ is not -->
<!--   zero. Fortunately it is clear that $h\ne0$ since the whole point of -->
<!--   introducing $h$ is for $x+h$ and $x$ to be two different values. -->
<!--   However, in the final step, after Equation~(\ref{equation:FermAd7}), -->
<!--   we took $h=0$ to ``make it correct'' but if $h$ is zero then we -->
<!--   couldn't have divided by $h$. We seem to be chasing our tails. We -->
<!--   need for $h$ to be equal to zero and not be equal to zero at the -->
<!--   same time! -->
  
<!--   This is the logical flaw. -->
  
<!--   Since we began with the assumption that $h\neq0$ we can't just -->
<!--   change our minds later. We can't have both $h=0$ and $h\neq0$. -->
<!-- </example> -->

<!-- Despite this logical flaw, Fermat's technique does seem to produce the -->

<!-- A few minutes of thought should convince you that what makes Fermat's -->

<!-- a special case of finding the slope of (the line tangent to) the curve -->
<!-- and he modified his method to determine the slope of a curve even when -->

<!--     \end{description} -->
<!--   \end{minipage} -->
<!-- \end{center} -->

<!-- These formulas are all really just rearrangements of one another. We -->

<!-- $y=x^2$ at the point $(1,1).$ -->

<!-- We need two points to determine the slope of a line, so with Fermat's -->

<!-- close to $(1,1).$ Since we don't really care which point we take as -->

<!-- thus very close together. This is represented in the sketch at the -->
<!-- right. -->

<!-- The slope of secant line joining $(1,1)$ and $(1+h,(1+h)^2)$ is given -->

<!--   To find the slope of the normal (and, eventually the tangent) line -->
<!--   to the graph of the curve $y=\sqrt{2x}$ at the point $(2,2)$ -->
<!--   Descartes' approach was to look at the family of circles with -->
<!--   centers on the $x$-axis and passing through the point $(2,2).$ The -->
<!--   sketch at the right displays several members of of that family of -->
<!--   circles.  Notice that each circle crosses the parabola at the point -->
<!--   $(2,2)$. We are searching for the center of the solid black circle -->
<!--   which touches (is tangent to) the parabola at $(2,2)$. If we can -->
<!--   find the center of the black circle then the radial line through the -->
<!--   point $(2,2)$ will be normal to the parabola at $(2,2)$ and the -->
<!--   slope of the tangent line will be the negative reciprocal of the -->
<!--   slope of the normal. -->
  
<!--   We now want to turn the geometric problem of finding the -->
<!--   intersection of our circle and parabola into an algebraic problem. -->
<!--   Let $(a,0)$ denote the coordinates of the center of a circle in that -->
<!--   family, then the equation of the circle with center $(a,0)$ is -->
<!--   $(x-a)^2+y^2=r^2$ where $r$ is the length of the radius of the -->
<!--   circle and $a$ is a parameter. Since we require our circle to pass -->
<!--   through the point $(2,2)$ the length of this radius will be the -->
<!--   distance from $(2,2)$ to $(a,0)$, $r=\sqrt{(2-a)^2+2^2}.$ Thus we -->
<!--   have -->
<!--   \begin{equation} -->
<!--     (x-a)^2+y^2=(2-a)^2+2^2.\label{eq:Descartes1} -->
<!--   \end{equation} -->
  
<!--   Since we are looking for the point where $y=\sqrt{2x}$ and the -->
<!--   circle intersect, we substitute $y=\sqrt{2x}$ into -->
<!--   Equation~(\ref{eq:Descartes1}) to get -->
<!--   \begin{align} -->
<!--     \nonumber  (x-a)^2+2x&=(2-a)^2+4 -->
<!--     \nonumber  x^2-2ax+a^2+2x&=4-4a+a^2+4 -->
<!--     x^2+(2-2a)x+(4a-8)&=0.\label{eq:NormQuad} -->
<!--   \end{align} -->
  
<!--   At this point it is tempting to use the Quadratic Formula to solve -->
<!--   for $x$ and get (typically) two distinct solutions for $x$ in terms -->
<!--   of $a$. But the fact is we really don't care about the variable -->
<!--   $x$. We want to find the value of $a$ which ensures that the circle -->
<!--   and the curve intersect exactly once. -->
  
<!--   Think about this for a moment. We get a single solution when we use -->
<!--   the Quadratic Formula to solve this equation precisely when the -->
<!--   discriminant (the part under the square root) is zero. -->
  
  
<!--   \begin{ProficiencyDrill} -->
<!--     \label{drill:HuddeDiscriminant} -->
<!--     Use the Quadratic Formula to show that the discriminant of -->
<!--     Equation~(\ref{eq:NormQuad}) is $(2-2a)^2-4(4a-8)$. -->
<!--   \end{ProficiencyDrill} -->
<!--   Setting the discriminant in Drill~\ref{drill:HuddeDiscriminant} -->
<!--   equal to zero and solving, we get -->
<!--   \begin{align*} -->
<!--     4-8a+4a^2-16a+32&=0 -->
<!--     4(a^2-6a+9)&=0 -->
<!--     4(a-3)^2&=0.  -->
<!--     a&=3, -->
<!--   \end{align*} -->
<!--   So the center of the circle touching the curve only once is at -->
<!--   $(3, 0)$ and the line segment from $(3,0)$ to $(2,2)$ is normal -->
<!--   (perpendicular) to the graph of $y=\sqrt{2x}$. -->
  
<!--   Descartes and Fermat are generally credited with the invention of -->
<!--   Analytic Geometry which is a technique that allows us to move -->
<!--   problems from Algebra to Geometry or, as in this problem, from -->
<!--   Geometry to Algebra. -->
  
  
<!--   \pagebreak[4] -->
<!--   \begin{embeddedproblem} -->
<!--     Descartes would not have approached this problem using the idea of -->
<!--     a discriminant as we just did.  He knew that the only way the -->
<!--     circle and the parabola could be tangent at $x=2$ is if $2$ is a -->
<!--     double root of Equation~(\ref{eq:NormQuad}).  Since a quadratic -->
<!--     polynomial only has two roots, this means that -->
<!--     Equation~(\ref{eq:NormQuad}) must be -->
<!--     \begin{equation} -->
<!--       (x-2)^2=0=x^2-4x+4. -->
<!--       \label{eq:DoubleRoot1} -->
<!--     \end{equation} -->
<!--     By comparing the coefficients of Equation~(\ref{eq:NormQuad}) and -->
<!--     the right side of Equation~(\ref{eq:DoubleRoot1}) show that $a=3$. -->
<!--   \end{embeddedproblem} -->
  
<!--   Like any powerful tool, Analytic Geometry must be used -->
<!--   carefully. Sometimes, as in this problem, the transition from -->
<!--   Geometry to Algebra can generate algebraic solutions that have no -->
<!--   corresponding geometric solution. An extraneous root is the most -->
<!--   common example of this. -->
  
  
<!--   \begin{embeddedproblem}[Extraneous Roots] -->
<!--     Show that the roots of $ x^2+(2-2a)x+(4a-8)=0$ are $x=2$ and -->
<!--     $x=2a-4$. Notice that when $a\ge2$ and $a\ne3$ we the parabola and -->
<!--     circle will have two intersection points (as seen in the graph in -->
<!--     Example~\ref{ex:DescartesNormal1}).  When $a\lt{}2$ we get one -->
<!--     positive and one negative root, but the parabola and the circle -->
<!--     cross only at $(2,2)$. How do we make peace with this -->
<!--     apparent contradiction? -->
<!--     \hint{Look closely at the equation for the parabola. Can $x$ be -->
<!--       negative? } -->
<!--   \end{embeddedproblem} -->
  
<!--   Example~\ref{ex:DescartesNormal1} illustrates that there is a -->
<!--   significant difference between curves touching (curves that are -->
<!--   tangent) and curves crossing (curves that intersect). Finding the -->
<!--   line tangent to a curve is actually much more subtle than you would -->
<!--   expect at first. But this is not the appropriate place to start that -->
<!--   conversation so we will hold off until we reach -->
<!--   Section~\ref{sec:veloc-slop-tang}. -->

<!-- \subsection*{Speed, Velocity, and Rates of Change} -->
<!-- Descartes and Fermat were co-creators of Analytic Geometry -\- the use -->
<!-- of Algebra to solve geometric problems -\- so their methods are -->
<!-- simultaneously algebraic and geometric in nature. That is, their -->
<!-- methods are static. There is no motion involved.  But at it's heart, -->
<!-- Calculus gives us a way of dealing with the properties of objects as -->
<!-- they change. It is the mathematics of motion. So we will need to think -->
<!-- more dynamically. -->

<!-- If quantity $A$ changes by $\Delta A$ each time quantity $B$ changes -->
<!-- by $\Delta B$ we say that the rate of change of $A$ <term>with respect -->
<!--   to</term> $B$ is $\frac{\Delta A}{\Delta B}$. -->

<!-- For example, in a video game if your character gains one hundred hit -->
<!-- points whenever you cast a certain spell we would say that the rate of -->
<!-- change of your hit points is one hundred points per spell, denoted -->
<!-- $100 \frac{\text{points}}{\text{spell}}$. If you gain fifty hit points -->
<!-- every second time you quaff a potion we write -->
<!-- $\frac{50\ \text{points}}{2\ \text{quaffs}}$ or, equivalently, -->
<!-- $25 \frac{\text{points}}{\text{quaff}}$ and we say that the rate of -->
<!-- change of hit points with respect to quaffs is twenty-five. Notice how -->
<!-- naturally the properties of fractions come into play: -->
<!-- $\frac{50\ \text{points}}{2\ \text{quaffs}} = 25 -->
<!-- \frac{\text{points}}{\text{quaff}}$. -->



<!-- On the other hand if you lose $15$ hit points each time an enemy -->
<!-- strikes you three times with a sword then your hit points are -->
<!-- decreasing at a rate of -->
<!-- $\frac{15\ \text{points}}{3\ \text{strikes}} = 5 -->
<!-- \frac{\text{points}}{\text{strike}}$. % Notice that the number of hit -->
<!-- It is inconvenient to specify whether $A$ is increasing or decreasing -->
<!-- verbally so we adopt the convention that a negative rate of change is -->
<!-- decreasing and a positive rate of change is increasing. -->

<!-- Speed is the rate of change we are most familiar with in daily life. -->
<!-- If you are driving on a flat, straight, road your speed is the -->
<!-- <term>rate of change</term> of your position, $\Delta x$, <term>with respect -->
<!--   to</term> the passage (change) of time, $\Delta t$.  If your speedometer -->
<!-- reads $60$ we say your speed is sixty miles per hour:\aside{At least -->
<!--   that's what we say in the United States. In most of the rest of the -->
<!--   world it means your speed is sixty kilometers per hour: -->
<!--   $60 \frac{\text{kilometers}}{\text{hour}}$, or $60$ kph.} -->
<!-- $60 \frac{\text{miles}}{\text{hour}}$, meaning of course that in one -->
<!-- hour you will travel sixty miles. This is often abbreviated to $60$ -->
<!-- mph. We will model a flat, straight, road as the $x$-axis with the -->
<!-- positive direction to the right, as is customary. Of course, on this -->
<!-- flat, straight, road we could be going -->
<!-- $60 \frac{\text{miles}}{\text{hour}}$ to the right or to the -->
<!-- left. Since there are only two directions possible, we can again use -->
<!-- negative numbers to indicate the direction of travel as depicted in -->
<!-- the sketch below. -->
<!-- \centerline{\includegraphics*[height=.8in,width=3in]{../Figures/Vector2}} -->

<!-- However if we are on a broad flat plain, as depicted in the sketch -->
<!-- below: -->
<!-- \centerline{\includegraphics*[height=2.9in,width=2.8in]{../Figures/Vector1}} -->
<!-- we can travel in any direction whatsoever. Notice that our sketch -->
<!-- indicates that there are eight cars, all traveling at -->
<!-- $60 \frac{\text{miles}}{\text{hour}}$, but in different -->
<!-- directions. That is, the <term>speed</term> of each car is -->
<!-- $60 \frac{\text{miles}}{\text{hour}}$. But it should be clear that a -->
<!-- single number is not adequate to fully describe the motion of these -->
<!-- cars. We also need to specify the direction of travel and simply using -->
<!-- plus or minus is no longer sufficient. -->

<!-- When we specify the speed and direction of motion of some object we -->
<!-- are stating its <term>velocity</term>. This can be difficult at first -->
<!-- because in casual conversation we use the words speed and velocity -->
<!-- interchangeably, so we tend to think of them as synonyms.  But in a -->
<!-- technical setting speed and velocity, while related, have different -->
<!-- meanings. <term>Speed</term> is how fast we're going. In the sketch at the -->
<!-- left the speed of all of the cars is -->
<!-- $60 \frac{\text{miles}}{\text{hour}}$. But their <term>velocities</term> are -->
<!-- all different. The velocity of one car is -->
<!-- $60 \frac{\text{miles}}{\text{hour}}$ to the north, the velocity of -->
<!-- another is $60 \frac{\text{miles}}{\text{hour}}$ to the west, the -->
<!-- velocity of a third is $60 \frac{\text{miles}}{\text{hour}}$ to the -->
<!-- southeast, and so on. -->

<!--   Personne de Roberval</url> $(1602-1675)$, a contemporary of Fermat and -->
<!-- Descartes, used arrows to indicate the velocity of moving objects just -->
<!-- as we have. The length of the arrow represents the speed of the object -->
<!-- and the direction of travel is the direction that the arrow -->
<!-- points. This works well in the kind of geometric arguments he used as -->
<!-- it enabled him to develop a method for constructing tangents which is -->
<!-- dynamic in nature. -->

<!-- Suppose you are on a moving sidewalk like those in an airport and the -->
<!-- sidewalk is moving at $3 \frac{\text{feet}}{\text{second}}$.  If you -->
<!-- stand still on the sidewalk then you are still moving at -->
<!-- $3 \frac{\text{feet}}{\text{second}}$. -->
<!-- \centerline{\includegraphics*[height=.75in,width=2in]{../Figures/Arrows1}} -->

<!-- If you are walking along the sidewalk at -->
<!-- $4 \frac{\text{feet}}{\text{second}}$ and in the same direction the -->
<!-- sidewalk is moving then it is pretty clear that you -->
<!-- are moving at a rate of $7 \frac{\text{feet}}{\text{second}}$. -->
<!-- \centerline{\includegraphics*[height=1.2in,width=3.3in]{../Figures/Arrows2}} -->
<!-- Of course, if you turn around and walk against the sidewalk, then -->
<!-- your speed  would be $1 \frac{\text{foot}}{\text{second}}$. -->
<!-- \centerline{\includegraphics*[height=1.2in,width=2.8in]{../Figures/Arrows3}} -->
<!-- If you are walking against the sidewalk but slower than the sidewalk -->
<!-- is moving, say at $2 \frac{\text{feet}}{\text{second}}$, then you are -->
<!-- again moving at -->
<!-- $1 \frac{\text{foot}}{\text{second}}$ but in the other direction. -->
<!-- \centerline{\includegraphics*[height=1.2in,width=2.4in]{../Figures/Arrows4}} -->

<!-- Since there are only two possible directions all this could have been -->
<!-- done without arrows by just adding signed numbers where the sign -->
<!-- indicates the direction: $3+ 4=7$, $3+(-4)=-1$, $3+(-2) =1$, but what -->
<!-- if there are more directions available? -->

<!-- Using arrows allows us to bring this discussion into a more general -->
<!-- setting. In the examples above notice that the resulting velocity (the -->
<!-- black arrow) was always obtained by attaching the tail of the green or -->
<!-- red arrow to the head of the blue arrow. -->


<!-- This works equally well if more directions are available, like when we -->
<!-- are moving in a plane instead of a straight line. -->

<!-- For example, suppose we are swimming across a river at a speed of -->
<!-- $ 2 \frac{\text{feet}}{\text{second}} $ and the river is flowing at -->
<!-- $3 \frac{\text{feet}}{\text{second}}$.  Assuming that we are swimming -->

<!--   graph. When we write $y=2x$ we are thinking of the entire -->
<!--   graph. When we write $ -->
<!--   P(t)= -->
<!--   \begin{Bmatrix} -->
<!--     x(t) -->
<!--     y(t) -->
<!--   \end{Bmatrix} -->
<!--   $ there is an implicit understanding that ($t$)ime is passing and we -->
<!--   are thinking about the motion of the point.  Thus when $t=1$ the -->
<!--   point is at $(1,2)$ when $t=2$ it's at $(2,4)$. -->
  
<!--   Think of the line as a road. The formula $y=2x$ describes the entire -->
<!--   road, whereas the expression $ P(t)= -->
<!--   \begin{Bmatrix} -->
<!--     t -->
<!--     2t -->
<!--   \end{Bmatrix} -->
<!--   $ tells us the point's location on the road at any given time, $t$. -->
  
<!--   The idea of representing velocities with arrows is quite a powerful -->
<!--   and common technique for representing non-linear motion. Roberval -->
<!--   used this technique to find the tangent lines of the conic sections -->
<!--   (as we will soon see) as well as more general curves. Since -->
<!--   Roberval's time this idea has been developed considerably beyond -->
<!--   what Roberval did. In fact we are skirting the edge of some very -->
<!--   deep ideas here. In modern terms these arrows would be called -->
<!--   \term{vectors}.  \term{Vector Addition} is then done by the -->
<!--   \term{Parallelogram Rule}, which is essentially what we did with our -->
<!--   arrows above: Form the parallelogram and find its diagonal.  The -->
<!--   full force of vector analysis was not available to Roberval, and we -->
<!--   won't need it, so we will not take you any further down this path -->
<!--   but we encourage you visualize velocities, and any other directed -->
<!--   quantity, as composed of horizontal and vertical components whenever -->
<!--   you can. You will see this representation in more detail later in -->

<!-- That $\alpha$ and $\beta$ in the previous problem are congruent has an -->

<!-- the angle of incidence is equal to the angle of reflection. Since this -->
<!-- mirror isn't flat the angles of incidence and reflection are measured -->
<!-- from the line tangent to the parabola at the point where the light -->
<!-- strikes the mirror. Thus the angle of incidence of a beam emerging -->
<!-- from $F$ and striking the parabola at $P$ will be $\alpha$ in our -->

<!-- follows that a light beam emerging from $F$ and reflecting from the -->
<!-- parabola at any point will follow a path parallel to the axis of -->

<!-- parabola. -->




<!-- You can see this in action with your car headlights or a -->

<!-- velocity $v_2$ in second medium, and that $\theta_1$ and -->
<!-- $\theta_2$ are as seen in the diagram below. -->
<!-- \centerline{\includegraphics*[height=1in,width=2in]{../Figures/Refraction2}} -->
<!-- Then the path that light follows satisfies -->
<!-- $$ -->
<!-- \frac{\sin(\theta_1)}{v_1} = \frac{\sin(\theta_2)}{v_2 }.  $$ -->
<!-- Notice that if $v_1=v_2$ this says that -->
<!-- $\sin(\theta_1)=\sin(\theta_2)$ and the path of the line would be a -->
<!-- straight line. -->

<!-- A number of mathematicians, including both Snell and Fermat, gave -->
<!-- derivations of Snell's Law, but we will focus on Fermat's method.  To -->
<!-- attack this problem, Fermat refined the <em>Nature is Lazy</em> -->
<!-- assumption a bit. Instead of assuming that that light would follow the -->
<!-- shortest path, he assumed that light would follow the path that takes -->
<!-- the least time. -->

<!-- Notice that this is consistent with our observations concerning -->
<!-- reflections from a mirror.  In that case, the speed of light was -->
<!-- constant so the shortest path was, in fact, the fastest path. But -->
<!-- refraction occurs because the velocity of light changes when the -->
<!-- surrounding medium changes. -->

<!-- Let's see what happens when we try to use Fermat's Method of -->
<!-- Adequality to find this fastest path. -->


<!-- \begin{embeddedproblem}{} -->
<!--   <!-\- \label{PIC:FermatSnell} -\-> -->
<!--   Assuming that the velocity\aside{Is it clear to you that we've used -->
<!--     velocity here when we really mean speed?  If not, think about it -->
<!--     for a moment. We're really only interested how fast light travels -->
<!--     in either medium, not in the direction it is going. This was the -->
<!--     language used in the seventeenth century so it is accurate -->
<!--     historically, but not mathematically.  Unfortunately, it is still -->
<!--     common to use these words interchangeably, even among folks who -->
<!--     know better. This can be quite confusing for the beginner but -->
<!--     there isn't much that can be done except be aware of the -->
<!--     problem. Whenever you encounter either word pause of a moment and -->
<!--     ask yourself if the speaker or author means speed, or velocity. It -->
<!--     should always be clear from the context.} of light is $v_1$ in the -->
<!--   first medium and -->
<!--   $v_2$ in the second,  use the following  diagram: -->
<!--   \centerline{\includegraphics*[height=1.9in,width=3.5in]{../Figures/Refraction4}} -->
<!--   to show the time, $t$, for light to travel along the path from $A$ -->
<!--   to $C$ $B$ is -->
<!--   $ \frac{\sqrt{a^2+x^2}}{v_1}+\frac{\sqrt{b^2+(c-x)^2}}{v_2}.  $ -->
<!-- \end{embeddedproblem} -->


<!-- Of course the next step would be to use Fermat's Method of Adequality -->
<!-- to minimize $t$, but the square roots involved make the Algebra -->
<!-- daunting to say the least. Despite these difficulties Fermat was able -->
<!-- to show that $t$ is minimized precisely when Snell's Law holds. -->

<!-- Although it is possible to derive Snell's Law with the tools we now -->
<!-- have it is very difficult so we won't attempt it here. Instead we will -->
<!-- return to this problem in <xref ref="CHAwhat-deriv-tells">Chapter</xref> where we -->
<!-- will complete the derivation of Snell's Law using the rules of -->
<!-- Calculus. That will be much simpler. -->


<!-- It seems that our efforts to solve optimization problems using -->
<!-- pre-Calculus techniques has hit an impasse. To be sure those -->
<!-- techniques, and others of a similar nature, were very clever and it -->
<!-- must be admitted that they yielded interesting and correct -->
<!-- results. However for the most part they were <foreign>ad hoc</foreign> methods -->
<!-- and quite limited in their applicability. We need a way to overcome -->
<!-- these limitations. -->

<!-- This is exactly what the invention of Calculus in the mid-seventeenth -->
<!-- century did. The title of Leibniz' first published work on Calculus -->
<!-- makes this very clear: -->

<!-- \begin{minipage}[]{.85\linewidth} -->
<!--   \it A New Method for Maxima and Minima, as Well as Tangents, Which -->
<!--   is Impeded Neither by Fractional nor Irrational Quantities, and a -->

<!-- It is time for us to learn about this <em>Remarkable Type -->
