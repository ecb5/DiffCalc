<p>
To see what's wrong with differentials consider the circle and the
differential triangle below.

Suppose that <m>\dx{s}</m> is one of the differentials that makes up
the circle. Since <m>\dx{s}</m> is a non-zero increment it has two distinct
endpoints so we can draw the two radii shown. Because the two
(distinct) endpoints that lie on the circle are <em>infinitely</em>
close together the two lines have the same slope. But all of the radii
of a circle pass through the center of the circle so these two in
particular must also intersect at the center, and we conclude that we
have two parallel lines that intersect.</p>

<p>But the only way that can happen is if they are actually the same
line, and if they are the same line then the points on the circle are
not really distinct as we've drawn them. But if they are not distinct
then <m>\dx{x}</m>, <m>\dx{y}</m>, and <m>\dx{s}</m> are all actually <em>equal</em> to
zero. If <m>\dx{x}</m> =0 then <m>\dfdx{y}{x}</m> is meaningless (why?).</p>

<p>This simple argument appears to completely destroy the differential
foundation upon which we've based everything we've done up until
now. Try as we might we can't escape the contradictions inherent in
the very notion of infinitely small numbers.</p>

<p>This is very troubling.</p>

Calculus and Bishop Berkeley

Berkeley's critique was both fierce and correct. Fortunately, it
was also (mostly) ignored in its time. Just as we have been so far,
mathematicians of the time were too busy <em>using</em> Calculus to
concern themselves much with the underlying foundational issues he
illuminated so well.  But these foundational issues are real and the
time has come for us to address the profound logical difficulties
inherent in the notion of an infinitely small quantity.
</p>
<p>
You may well wonder why a Bishop in the Church of England and a
philosopher would concern himself with the methods of scientific
analysis and investigation. The fact is that Berkeley didn't really
have any quarrel with the use of differentials (or fluxions) in
science at all. He was, in fact, a great admirer of Newton and he
understood very well that the techniques Newton and Leibniz had
introduced actually worked, at least most of the time. He says as much
himself in <pubtitle>The Analyst</pubtitle>
<historical> 
  <p>
    In the eighteenth century English nouns were frequently capitalized,
    and spelling was not as standardized as it is today, so Berkeley's
    work looks a little odd to modern eyes. But it is quite readable
    English. Stretch yourself
    </p>.
  </historical>
  <blockquote>
    "I have no Controversy about your Conclusions, but only about your
    Logic and Method. . . . It must be remembered that I am not
    concerned about the truth of your Theorems, but only about the way
    of coming at them; . . . it may perhaps seem an unaccountable
    Paradox, that Mathematicians should deduce true Propositions from
    false Principles, be right in the Conclusion, and yet err in the
    Premises . . . "     (Section XX)
  </blockquote>
</p>
<p>
Berkeley might not have bothered publishing his criticisms of Calculus
but during the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries a religious
movement known as <url href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/Deism" visual="https://www.britannica.com/topic/Deism">Deism</url>
(called
"Free-Thinking" in England) was very strong throughout Europe. Many
of the scientists of the age were supportive of the Deistic movement
because, while Deism itself is not a form of atheism, many of its
adherents were atheists. Moreover the Free-Thinkers in England
explicitly espoused the questioning and criticism of religious tenets
and attitudes.  Christianity was attacked by some Deists on the
grounds that it was not logical and contained too many mysteries.
</p>

<p>As a member of the clergy Berkeley felt compelled to answer these
criticisms. Speaking directly to the English scientific community he
said, 

<blockquote>
     "Whereas then it is supposed, that you apprehend more
    distinctly, consider more closely, infer more justly, conclude
    more accurately than other Men, and that you are therefore less
    religious because more judicious, I shall claim the privilege of a
    Free-Thinker; and take the Liberty to inquire into the Object,
    Principles, and Method of Demonstration admitted by the
    Mathematicians of the present Age, with the same freedom that you
    presume to treat the Principles and Mysteries of Religion; to the
    end, that all Men may see what right you have to lead, or what
    Encouragement others have to follow you."
    (Section II)
</blockquote>

He made his purpose clear from the outset by including a biblical
verse (Mathew, chapter 7, verse 5) on the title page of \pubtitle{The
  Analyst}:

<blockquote>
"First cast out the beam out of thine own Eye; and then
shalt thou see clearly to cast out the mote out of thy brother's eye."
</blockquote>

</p>
So Berkeley's purpose in writing \pubtitle{The Analyst} was to defend
his religion rather than to attack mathematics. But he was well
acquainted with the adage, "The best defense is a good offense" and
he mounted a very good defense.

Some of Berkeley's specific criticisms will be illuminating<aside>{The
  language of Calculus wasn't entirely established yet so when
  Berkeley says "Differences" he means what we've been calling
  differentials.</aside>.

<blockquote>
     " . . .  they consider the Increments or Decrements
    themselves, which they call Differences, and which are supposed to
    be infinitely small  . . . . Now to conceive a Quantity infinitely
    small, that is, infinitely less than any sensible or imaginable
    Quantity, or than any the least finite Magnitude, is, I confess,
    above my Capacity.  . . .  But to conceive a Part of such
    infinitely small Quantity, that shall be still infinitely less
    than it, and consequently though multipliy'd infinitely shall
    never equal the minutest finite Quantity is, I suspect, an
    infinite Difficulty to any Man whatsoever . . ." (Section V)
</blockquote>



Do you see what he's complaining about? Berkeley is questioning the
very existence of the differentials we have been relying on
since we began. And he has a point. As we've seen our differentials have
to satisfy two mutually exclusive properties. They can't be zero but
they must be smaller than "the least finite Magnitude." On its face
this seems to be impossible.

But Berkeley goes further. He says that:

<blockquote>
     " . . .  our modern Analysts are not content to consider
    only the Differences of finite Quantities: they also consider the
    the Differences of those Differences, and the Differences of the
    Differences of the first Differences. And so on<emph>{ad
      infinitum.</emph> That is, they consider Quantities infinitely less
    than the least discernible Quantity; and others infinitely less
    than those infinitely small ones; and still others infinitely less
    than the preceding Infinitesimals, and so on without end or limit
     . . .  And (which is most strange) although you should take a
    Million of Millions of these Infinitesimals, each whereof is
    supposed infinitely greater than some other real Magnitude, and
    add them to the least given Quantity, it shall be never the
    bigger. For this is one of the modest <em>postulata</em> of our
    modern Mathematicians, and it is a Corner-stone or Ground-work of
    their Speculations."    (Section VI)
</blockquote>


Clearly Berkeley is contemptuous of the reasoning we've used to
justify our differentiation rules. And, again, he has a point. We have
pushed aside issues like this until now because we knew we were
showing you the correct techniques, even if our justifications would
not bear close examination. In the beginning it was more important
that you learn to <em>use</em> Calculus than that you understand
all of the logical subtleties that have been used to justify it
rigorously.

But wait a second. We <em>know</em> Calculus works. We've been
successfully solving abstruse and difficult problems with it for some
time. Throughout the first part of this text we've seen ample, even
overwhelming, evidence of this fact.  Isn't that sufficient?  Can't we
conclude from the fact that it <em>does</em> seem to work that the
notion of the differential is tenable after all?

Sadly, no. Berkeley thought of that too:

<blockquote>
    
    "But this inverted way of demonstrating your Principles by your
    Conclusions . . .  is contrary to the Rules of Logic. The truth of
    a Conclusion will not prove either the Form or the Matter . . .
    to be true . . . I say that in every other Science Men prove their
    Conclusions by their Principles, and not their Principles by their
    Conclusions."  (Section XX)
</blockquote>


In order to have confidence in our knowledge, we must begin with
simple, clear ideas and build on them logically. Nothing else will do.
