 Recall that in <xref ref="PROBLEMSpinCast1">Problem</xref> we did not
 explain how we knew that the centripetal force was 
<men  xml:id="FORMULACentripetalForce">mx\omega^2</men>.  We said that we
 would be able to show that this is the correct formula for the
 centripetal force once we had extended the scope of our
 differentiation rules. Extending our differentiation rules to include
 the trigonometric rules, which we will do next, will enable us to
 explain where <xref ref="FORMULACentripetalForce">formula</xref> came
 from.
</p>

<p>
According to Newton, <em>Force = mass <m>\times</m> acceleration</em>,
so to verify the centripetal force formula the task is to show that
centripetal acceleration is given by <m>x\omega^2</m>. We will finally
do this in <xref ref="PROBLEMSpinCastCentripetalForce"></xref> but
first, we<rsq/>ll need to be able to differentiate both the sine and
the cosine functions.  In fact, since acceleration is the second
derivative of position, we will need the second derivatives of both.
Once the derivatives of the sine and cosine are known, computing the
derivatives of the other four trigonometric functions is
straightforward.
</p>
<p>

But before we begin we will remind you of some useful facts from
Trigonometry.

<p>
You are probably accustomed to measuring angles in degrees.  We hope
to convince you that <term>radian measure</term> actually is much more
natural.  It doesn<rsq/>t feel natural to you at first simply because
it is new and unfamiliar.
</p>
<p>

Suppose two children ride on a merry-go-round through an angle
<m>\theta</m>, one child is <m>2</m> meters from the center, the other <m>4</m> is
meters from the center.  However we choose to measure the angle
<m>\theta</m>, it is pretty clear that the child who is <m>4</m> meters away
from the center will travel farther than the child who is <m>2</m> meters
away from the center, even though both of their paths have swept out
the same angle, <m>\theta</m>.
</p>
<image source="images/MerryGoRound2.png" width="40%"/>


<p>
This tells us is that the distance traveled for a fixed angle along a
circle will be proportional to the radius of the circle. To find the
actual distance traveled is harder as the following drill shows.
</p>

<exercise xml:id="DRILLDegreeDemo">
  <statement>
    <p>
      Now suppose
      <m>\theta=57^\circ</m>. Use the sketch above to show that the first child
      travels slightly less than <m>2</m> meters along the red circle while the
      second travels slightly less than <m>4</m> meters along the blue circle.
</p>
<p>
      (Why do you suppose we chose <m>\theta=57^\circ</m>
      rather than something more familiar like <m>\theta=45^\circ</m> or
      <m>\theta=30^\circ</m>? It seems an odd choice, doesn<rsq/>t it?)
    </p>
  </statement>
  <hint>
    <p>
      If we travel <m>57^\circ</m> around a circle, what fraction of the
      circumference of the circle have we traversed?
    </p>
  </hint>

</exercise>
<p>

<xref ref="DRILLDegreeDemo"></xref> was not particularly hard, but it was
complicated by the use of degree measure.  Radian measure removes that
complication.
</p>
<p>

If on a circle with radius <m>2</m> meters, like the red circle in the
figure above, we trace out a circular arc equal to the length of its
radius we say that the arc-length is <m>2</m> meters. If we trace out a
distance equal to the length of its radius on the blue circle
then this is an arc-length of <m>4</m> meters.
</p>
<p>

But notice that the same central angle subtends both of these arcs. We
defince the measure of this angle to be one <term>radian</term> because it
is the angle associated with a single radius. An angle of two radians
is thus the angle subtended when we measure out an arc length two
times the radius of the circle.
</p>
<p>

In general we have the following result:
<me>
\text{arclength }=(\text{length of radius})\times(\text{number of
  radians in }\theta).
</me>
</p>
<p>

More succinctly, if we let <m>s</m> represent the arclength and measure
<m>\theta</m> in radians we have
<men  xml:id="EQUATIONarclength">
  s=r\theta.
<!-- \label{eq:arclength} -->
</men>
</p>
<p>

In <xref ref="DRILLDegreeDemo">Drill</xref>, if we had measured <m>\theta</m> in
radians rather than degrees, the computations for each of the
arclengths would be <m>s=2\theta</m> (when <m>r=2</m>) and, <m>s=4\theta</m> (when
<m>r=4</m>).  We chose an angle of <m>57^\circ</m> because <m>57^\circ</m> is
slightly less than an angle of one radian. So we know that the first
child traveled slightly less than the radius, <m>2</m> meters. Similarly
the second child traveled slightly less than <m>4</m> meters.
</p>
<p>

Rather than constantly translating between degrees and radians it will
be simplest if you learn to think in radians directly.  You should
start trying to do that immediately.  But breaking old habits is
difficult so we need to see how to convert between them. Fortunately
this is not hard.
</p>
<p>

Since the circumference of a circle is <m>2\pi r</m>, one full transit
around the circle subtends an angle of <m>2\pi</m> radians.  In degrees, a
full circle is <m>360^\circ</m>, so we have
<me>
360^\circ=\frac{2\pi r}{r}=2\pi \text{ radians.}
</me>
</p>
<p>

This leads to the conversion, <m> \pi \text{ radians}=180^\circ</m> and the
identities:
<md>
<mrow>  \pi/2\text{ radians}\amp =180^\circ/2=90^\circ,</mrow>
<mrow>  \pi/3\text{ radians}\amp =180^\circ/3=60^\circ,</mrow>
<mrow>  \pi/4\text{ radians}\amp =180^\circ/4=45^\circ,</mrow>
<mrow>  \pi/6\text{ radians}\amp =180^\circ/6=30^\circ.</mrow>
</md>

Thus, as we mentioned earlier,
<m>1\text{ radian}=(180^\circ)/\pi\approx57.296^\circ</m>.
</p>
<p>

You may find it simpler to just remember that <m>2\pi</m> radians is one
full rotation around a circle, so <m>\pi</m> radians (a straight angle) is
halfway around a circle, and a right angle is half of that, (<m>\pi/2</m>
radians). Three quarters of the way around a circle would thus be
<m>\pi+\pi/2=3\pi/2</m> radians, etc.
</p>
<p>

Use whatever works for you but do start thinking in radians rather
than degrees as quickly as you can. It will make what<rsq/>s coming up
easier for you.
</p>
<p>

We adopt the custom that positive angles are counterclockwise and
negative angles are clockwise.

<p>

So far in this chapter we<rsq/>ve only considered static angles. If an
object is moving in a circle as in the sketch then the rate of change
of the central angle is called the <term>angular velocity</term>.
</p>
<p>

Angular velocity is <m>\dfdx{\theta}{t}</m>, the rate of change of the
central angle, <m>\theta</m> with respect to time.  Of course the object
still has both a vertical velocity, <m>\dfdx{y}{t}</m> and a horizontal
velocity, <m>\dfdx{x}{t}</m>.
</p>
<p>

In the diagram below the angular velocity,
<me>
\dfdx{\theta}{t}=3
\frac{\cancel{\text{revolutions}}}{\text{minute}}\times2\pi\frac{\text{radians}}{\cancel{\text{revolution}}}=6\pi\frac{\text{radians}}{\text{minute}},
</me>
measures how fast our object is revolving about the point <m>O</m> in the
positive (counterclockwise) direction. The sign of angular velocity
indicates its direction: Positive means counterclockwise and negative
means clockwise. The absolute value of the angular velocity,
<m>\abs{\dfdx{\theta}{t}}</m>, is the <term>angular speed</term>.
</p>
<image source="images/AngularVelocity3.png" width="30%"/>


<p>
As we saw in <xref ref="SECTIONnewt-flux-dynam">Section</xref> the velocity in the
direction of motion is denoted, <m>\dfdx{s}{t}</m> where the length of
<m>\dx{s}</m> is the (infinitesimal) hypotenuse of the differential
triangle in our diagram. Thus <m>\dfdx{s}{t}</m> denotes the <term>linear
  velocity</term> of the object. Because <m>\dx{s}</m> is tangent to the path of
the object, <m>\dfdx{s}{t}</m> is also called the <term>tangential
  velocity</term>.
</p>
<p>

The direction of the linear velocity is the direction the object is
moving as it passes through the point <m>P</m>, but notice that the
direction cannot be specified with a plus or a minus because the
object can travel in more than two directions.  During a single
circumnavigation the object is traveling in a different direction at
every point in its path.
</p>
<p>

We will continue to use the symbol <m>\dfdx{s}{t}</m> to denote the
tangential velocity. But be aware that this a rather clumsy notation
because it doesn<rsq/>t provide a simple way to indicate the direction of
travel. This deficiency in our notation will eventually need to be
addressed. For now we will be primarily be interested in the
<term>linear (tangential) speed</term>: <m>\abs{\dfdx{s}{t}}</m>.
</p>
<p>

The tangential speed tells us how fast the object would move in a
straight line if the force holding it in a circular path were suddenly
released -- think of an object swinging on a string if the string
breaks.
</p>
<p>

Conversion from angular velocity to linear speed is essentially a
change of units, but we need to remember that velocity has direction
and speed does not. So we must first convert angular velocity to
angular speed by taking its absolute value. In our diagram above the
angular velocity of the point <m>P</m> about the point <m>O</m> is
<m>3 \frac{\text{revolutions}}{\text{minute}}</m>.  We compute the
linear speed of <m>P</m> as follows:

<md>
<mrow>
\abs{\frac{1}{3}\frac{\cancel{\textcolor{red}{\text{revolutions}}}}{\cancel{\textcolor{blue}{\text{minute}}}}}
\left(\frac{2\pi }{1} \frac{\cancel{\textcolor{green} {\text{radians}}}}
  {\cancel{\textcolor{red} {\text{revolution}}} }\right)
\cdot
\left(\frac{10}{1}\frac{\text{meters}}
{\cancel{\textcolor{green}{\text{radians}}}}
\right)\amp{}\cdot
\left(
\frac{1}{60}
\frac{\cancel{\textcolor{blue}{\text{minute}}}}
{\text{seconds}}
\right)
</mrow>
 <mrow>
\amp{}=
\frac{\pi}{1}\frac{\text{meters}}{\text{second}}</mrow>
<mrow>\amp{}\approx
3.14 \frac{\text{meters}}{\text{second}}</mrow>
</md>

<!-- <me> -->
<!-- \abs{\frac{3}{1}\frac{\text{\cancel{\textcolor{red}{revolutions} -->
<!--       }}}{{\text{\cancel{\textcolor{blue}{minute}}}}}}\cdot -->
<!-- \left(\frac{2\pi}{1} -->
<!--   \frac{\text{\cancel{\textcolor{green}{radians}}}}{\text{\cancel{\textcolor{red}{revolution}}}}\right)\cdot -->
<!-- \left(\frac{10}{1}\frac{\text{meters}}{\text{\cancel{\textcolor{green}{radians}}}}\right)\cdot -->
<!-- \left(\frac{1}{60}\frac{\text{\cancel{\textcolor{blue}{minute}}}}{\text{second}}\right) -->
<!-- =\frac{\pi}{1} \frac{\text{meters}}{\text{second}} \approx 3.14 -->
<!-- \frac{\text{meters}}{\text{second}}. -->
<!-- </me> -->

In the computation above the absolute value was superfluous since the
angular velocity was positive. However if the object were traveling
clockwise it would have been essential to take the absolute value
first because a negative speed is meaningless.
</p>
            
<aside>
<title>Terminology</title>
<p>
In ordinary speech the words speed and velocity are often used
interchangeably, which can make the distinction we are stressing here
difficult to absorb. The distinction is this: Velocity has a magnitude
and a direction. The magnitude of velocity is speed.

<title>The Trigonometric Functions</title>
<!-- <introduction> -->
<p>      
You are probably most familiar with right triangle Trigonometry, where
the functions are defined in terms of the sides of a triangle. This is
the simplest way to introduce these functions but historically
Trigonometry emerged from the geometry of a circle. Ancient
astronomers
found it useful to have a <term>Table of Chords</term> to refer to. A chord
is the line segment that cuts off part of a circle.
</p>
<!-- </introduction> -->
<!-- <subsubsection> -->
<!-- <title>The Sine Function</title> -->
<p>
The name of the sine function has a colorful history. In <pubtitle>The
  Words of Mathematics,</pubtitle> Steven Schwartzman explains:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
In dealing with spherical trigonometry used to study astronomy,
Hindu mathematicians determined that it was often convenient to deal
with half-chords.  The Hindu mathematician
<url href="https://mathshistory.st-andrews.ac.uk/Biographies/Aryabhata_I/" visual="https://mathshistory.st-andrews.ac.uk/Biographies/Aryabhata_I/">Aryabhata</url>
(<m>476-550</m> A.D.)  frequently used the abbreviation <foreign>jya</foreign> for
the word <foreign>jya-ardha</foreign> (half chord).  This was phonetically
translated into <foreign>jiba</foreign> by subsequent Arabic mathematicians.
Since Arabic is written without vowels then this was written as
<foreign>jb</foreign>.  When Arabic works were translated into Latin,
<foreign>jb</foreign> posed a problem as there is no such word as
<foreign>jiba</foreign> in Arabic (recall it was translated phonetically).  The
closest <lsq/>real<rsq/> Arabic word is <foreign>jaib</foreign> which means <lsq/>cove<rsq/> or
<lsq/>bay.<rsq/>  The Latin word for this is <foreign>sinus</foreign> which becomes our
modern sine.
</p>

Etymology also helps to explain where the names of the other
trigonometric functions came from.  When
<m>0\le\theta\le\frac{\pi}{2}</m> the sine, tangent, and secant
functions can be represented as the length of a particular line
segment and their names are descriptive of these segments.  Let
<m>0\le\theta\le\frac{\pi}{2}</m> be an angle in standard position
(with its vertex at the origin and its initial side along the
<m>x</m>-axis). On the positive <m>x</m>-axis mark off the line
segment <m>OA</m> that is <m>1</m> unit long. On the terminal side of
the angle, mark off the line segment <m>OB</m> so that the line
segment <m>AB</m> is tangent to the unit circle.  Then the length of
the tangent line segment <m>\overline{AB}</m> is <m>\tan(\theta)</m>,
while the length of the other line segment <m>\overline{OB}</m> is
<m>\sec(\theta)</m>. All of this is depicted in the sketch below As
we<rsq/>ve already seen the word <q>tangent</q> comes from the Latin
<foreign>tangere</foreign> meaning <q>to touch.</q> Similarly the word
<q>secant</q> comes from the Latin <foreign>secare</foreign> meaning
<q>to cut.</q>

<title>Modeling with Trigonometric Functions </title>

<p>
  The sine and cosine functions are <term>periodic</term>
  functions. As such they are useful for modeling phenomena which are
  cyclical in nature; that is, phenomena which repeat the same pattern
  periodically.  This periodicity is reflected in the formulas:

  <md>
    <mrow>
      \cdots = \sin(\theta-2\pi)\amp  =\sin(\theta)=\sin(\theta+2\pi)=\sin(\theta+4\pi)=\cdots 
    </mrow>
    <mrow>
      \cdots = \cos(\theta-2\pi)\amp=\cos(\theta)=\cos(\theta+2\pi)=\cos(\theta+4\pi)=\cdots
    </mrow>
  </md>
 

  The rationale for the term <term>periodic</term> is
  very evident when we graph <m>\sin(\theta)</m> on a set of
  <m>(\theta, y)</m> axes.
</p>
<image source="images/Periodicity1.png" width="95%" />
<!--  \centerline{\includegraphics*[height=1.3In,width=5in]{../Figures/Periodicity1}} -->
<p>
As you can see a full cycle is completed over every interval of length
<m>2\pi</m>. Thus the sine and cosine functions are said to be
<m>2\pi</m>-periodic. We can start our cycle for any value of <m>\theta</m>, but
you are probably accustomed to graphing one complete cycle over the
interval <m>[0,2\pi]</m> as in the graphs below.
</p>
<exercise xml:id="DRILLPeriodicFunctions">
<statement>
<p>
  Because <m>\sin(t)</m> and <m>\cos(t)</m> complete one cycle on an interval of
  <m>2\pi</m> they are called <m>2\pi</m>-<term>periodic</term> functions. Suppose
  that <m>A</m>, <m>B</m>, and <m>C</m> are constants. Choose several non-zero values
  for <m>A</m>, <m>B</m>, and <m>C</m> (at least three of each) and graph the
  function
  <me>z(t)=A \sin(t) + B\cos(t)+C</me> to show graphically that
  <m>z(t)</m> is also a <m>2\pi</m>-periodic function.

<p>

Notice that on any interval of length <m>2\pi</m> the function
<m>y=\sin(\theta)</m> takes on every possible value between <m>-1</m> and <m>1</m>,
so the <term>amplitude</term> of this sine wave is <m>1</m>.  Changing the
amplitude of a periodic function is easy.  If we want an amplitude of
<m>5</m> then we just multiply by <m>5</m>: <m>y=5\sin(\theta)</m>.  This new
function will oscillate between <m>-5</m> and <m>5</m>.
</p>
<p>

If we are modeling some real-world phenomenon then the amplitude will
correspond to some physical attribute of the phenomenon. For example
increasing the amplitude of a sound wave will increase the volume of
the sound.
</p>
<p>

The sinusoidal axis is the horizontal line in the center of the range.
So, for <m>y=\sin(\theta)</m> the sinusoidal axis is horizontal axis
(<m>y=0</m>) because the graph of <m>y=0</m> is at the center of the range
<m>-1\le y\le1</m>. Likewise the horizontal axis is the sinusoidal axis for
<m>y=5\sin(\theta)</m>. But if we have <m>y=3+5\sin(\theta)</m>, this would
shift the sinusoidal axis to the line <m>y=3</m>, because this line would
be at the center of the range and the wave would oscillate between
<m>3-5=2</m> and <m>3+5=8</m>.
</p>

<exercise xml:id="DRILLSinusoidalAxis">
<statement>
<p>
  Suppose we had a sinusoidal wave oscillating between <m>-4</m> and <m>12</m>.
  What would be the amplitude and what would be the sinusoidal axis of
  this wave?
</p>
</statement>
</exercise>

<example xml:id="EXAMPLEHertz">
<p>
  The pitch of a sound wave is regulated by how fast the wave is
  oscillating. Faster oscillations mean higher pitches. Suppose we
  want a wave that oscillates once per second.  Our base function,
  <m>y=\sin(\theta)</m>, oscillates once over the interval
  <m>0\le \theta\le2\pi</m>.  Divide <m>\theta</m> by <m>2\pi</m>, so that we have
  one oscillation occurring when <m>0\le \frac{\theta}{2\pi}\le 1</m>.  If
  we let <m>t=\frac{\theta}{2\pi}</m> so that <m>\theta=2\pi t</m> then
  <m>y=\sin(2\pi t)</m>
  oscillates at a rate of one cycle per second as in the following graph.
</p>  
<image source="images/Periodicity3.png" width="95%" />
 <!-- \centerline{\includegraphics*[height=1.3in,width=5in]{../Figures/Periodicity3}} -->
<p>
  Now suppose we want to double the frequency to <m>2</m> oscillations per
  second.  Again our base function <m>y=\sin(\theta)</m> oscillates once
  for <m>0\le \theta \le 2\pi</m>. We want two oscillations per second or
  one oscillation per half second. So, we want
  <m>0\le\frac{\theta}{4\pi}\le \frac12</m>.  Letting
  <m>t=\frac{\theta}{4\pi}</m> we see that <m>y=\sin(4\pi t)</m> oscillates
  once every half second (or twice every second) as in the following  graph.
</p>  
<image source="images/Periodicity4.png" width="95%" />
 <!-- \centerline{\includegraphics*[height=1.3in,width=5in]{../Figures/Periodicity4}} -->
<p>
  The number of cycles per second is referred to as the number of
  <term>Hertz</term>  (Hz).  So <m>y=\sin(2\pi t)</m>
  oscillates at <m>1</m> Hz and <m>y=\sin(4\pi t)</m> oscillates at <m>2</m> Hz.

There is one more aspect of periodic functions we need to address
before we put all of this together, and that is the <term>phase
  shift</term>.  To illustrate phase shift, consider the graph at the
right. We last saw this graph when we introduced Fermat<rsq/>s Method of
Adequality in <xref ref="SECTIONFermMethAedeq">Section</xref>.  It represents the
number of hours of daylight in Santa Barbara, CA over a given year.
            The graph of <m>y(t)</m> represents a full cycle (one year) but it is not
quite the graph of <m>y(t)=12+2.26\sin\left(\frac{2\pi t}{365}\right)</m>
as we would expect from our discussion of period and amplitude. The
graph of <m>y(t)</m> gives the correct sinusoidal axis of <m>y=12</m>, and the
correct maximum <m>(12+2.26=14.26)</m> and minimum <m>(12-2.26=9.74)</m> but it
does not quite match the blue graph.

We can easily see the problem if we compare our original graph (above)
to the graph of <m>y(t)</m> as seen in the figure at the left. The two
graphs clearly have the same shape but our guess has been shifted to
the left by about <m>80</m> days. Since the red graph represents the
typical graph of a single cycle for a sine curve, we say that the blue
graph has undergone a <term>phase shift</term> of <m>80</m> days.  Let<rsq/>s make
this a bit more precise.
</p>
<p>

The red sine wave <m>y(t)=12+2.6\sin\left(\frac{2\pi t}{365}\right)</m>,
shows that at day <m>1</m> (January <m>1</m>) we have <m>12</m> hours of daylight,
and immediately thereafter the number of hours of daylight
increases. But we know that this actually happens at the spring
equinox, March <m>21</m> or day <m>80</m>. For the red graph to coincide with
the blue graph we need for it to shift to the right so that it
shows <m>12</m> hours of daylight on day <m>80</m> and completes one cycle in
the interval <m>[80, 445]</m>.
</p>
<p>

To obtain the proper equation, we go back to basics.  Our basic sine
wave <m>y=\sin(\theta)</m> oscillates once for <m>0\le\theta\le 2\pi</m>.  To
get the proper period, we have
<me>
0\le\frac{365\theta}{2\pi}\le365.
</me>
To get our phase shift, we add <m>80</m> to each term to obtain
<me>
80\le\frac{365\theta}{2\pi}+80\le445.
</me>

<title>Polar Coordinates</title>

<p>

When we say that the coordinates of point <m>P</m> in the plane are
<m>(x,y)</m> we are referring to the <term>Cartesian (or rectangular)
coordinates</term>. They are named in honor of René Descartes who, as
we mentioned in <xref ref="SECTIONroberv-conic-sect">Section</xref>,
was one of the pioneers in applying algebra to geometry. The geometric
picture that goes with this is shown below.
</p>

<!-- <figure> -->

<!--   \centerline{\includegraphics*[height=1in,width=1.5in]{../Figures/CartCoord3}} -->
<!--   \label{fig:CartCoord} -->
<!-- \end{wrapfigure} -->

<p>
Using rectangular coordinates is one way to to translate geometry
problems into algebra problems and <foreign>vice versa</foreign>. This simple
idea changed forever how mathematics is done. Really.
</p>

<!-- \begin{wrapfigure}[6]{r}{1.6in} -->

<!-- \end{wrapfigure} -->
<p>

But Cartesian coordinates are not the only way we can locate points in
the plane.  If we superimpose a right triangle on the diagram above,
as shown at the left, we can find another way to locate <m>P</m>. Since <m>P</m>
is the endpoint of the ray starting at the origin and ending at <m>P</m>
the ordered pair of numbers <m>(r,\theta)</m> works just as well as the
ordered pair <m>(x,y)</m>. The numbers <m>r</m> and <m>\theta</m> are called the
<term>polar coordinates</term> of <m>P</m>.

<p>
There are advantages and disadvantages to either coordinate
system. For example the coordinates in the Cartesian system are
unique. There is only point with rectangular coordinates, <m>(3,4)</m>
(where <m>x=3</m> and <m>y=4</m>). This is not true of polar coordinates. The
point with polar coordinates <m>(2, \pi)</m> (where <m>r=2</m> and <m>\theta=\pi</m>)
is the same as the point with polar coordinates <m>(2,-\pi)</m> (where
<m>r=2</m> and <m>\theta=-\pi</m>).
It is also the same as the point with polar coordinates <m>(-2,\pi)</m>,
where <m>r=-2</m> (gasp!). The idea of a negative value for <m>r</m> is a
little jarring because we usually think of the negative sign as
denoting negative numbers. Instead, think of it as meaning <q>go
the opposite direction.</q>
</p>

<aside>
<title>Comment</title>
<p>
Thinking this way also explains why the
  negative of a negative must be positive. The number <m>2</m> is at the
  endpoint of a ray pointing to the right along the <m>x</m>-axis.
  If we put a negative  sign in front we <q>go the opposite direction</q>
  to <m>-2</m>. Another
  negative will reverse the direction again.

Just like the Cartesian coordinates the order of polar coordinates
matters. The radius <m>r</m> comes first, and the angle <m>\theta</m> comes
second. Notice that there is nothing in the ordered pair notation that
tells you which system is in play. This will usually be clear from the
context but if you are ever unsure whether the ordered pair <m>(a,b)</m>
represents Cartesian or polar coordinates ask your instructor.

An advantage of using polar coordinates is that the formula that

a function of <m>x</m> but extraordinarily simple if we give <m>r</m> as a
function of <m>\theta</m>.

Recall that when a central angle <m>\theta</m>, of a unit circle is
measured in radians then the arclength subtended by that angle will
also be <m>\theta</m> as seen in the sketch at the left. Similarly, when
we increase the angle <m>\theta</m> by <m>\dx{\theta}</m> the blue arc is also
of length <m>\dx{\theta}</m>. Moreover,  by the Principle
of Local Linearity the blue arc length can be thought of as an
infinitely small straight line. Thus it is the hypotenuse of the blue
triangle.

<p>
In <xref ref="SECTIONpolar-coordinates">Section</xref> we introduced the polar
coordinates and the equations
<mdn>
<mrow xml:id="EQUATIONpolarx">   x=r\cos(\theta)</mrow>
<mrow xml:id="EQUATIONpolary">   y=r\sin(\theta)</mrow>

</p>
<p>
Given a functional relation between <m>r</m> and <m>\theta</m> like those we saw
in <xref ref="PROBLEMPolarGraphs"></xref>  it should be clear that the
differential ratio <m>\dfdx{r}{\theta}</m> is not the slope of the
tangent line.  However it is still the rate of change of <m>r</m> with
respect to <m>\theta</m>.
</p>
<p>
Regardless of which coordinate system we use, the slope of the line
tangent to a curve is still given by <m>\dfdx{y}{x}</m> for the same reason
that <m>\frac{\Delta y}{\Delta x}</m> gives the slope of the line: Both
<m>\dfdx{y}{x}</m> and <m>\frac{\Delta y}{\Delta x}</m> represent a displacement
in the vertical direction divided by a displacement in the horizontal
direction. But <m>\dfdx{r}{\theta}</m> is the rate of change of distance
from the origin, <m>r</m>, with respect to a change of the angle, <m>\theta</m>.

Suppose a bead is sliding down a frictionless wire from point <m>A</m> to
point <m>B</m> as seen below.
 </p>
<image source="images/Brach1.png" width="30%"/>
<p>
  Assuming that the bead starts at rest and slides down the wire under
  the influence of gravity only, what shape do you think the wire must
  have if the bead descends from <m>A</m> to <m>B</m> in the least
  possible time. Galileo thought the path of least time had to be a
  circular arc as we<rsq/>ve drawn it here, but he could not prove it.
  Think about this for a moment before reading on. What does your
  intuition tell you the solution must be?
</p>
<aside>
  <title>Terminology</title>
  <p>
    <q> Brachistochrone</q> comes from two Greek words meaning <q>least
    time.</q>
  </p>
</aside>

<p>
This question is known as the
<url href="https://mathshistory.st-andrews.ac.uk/HistTopics/Brachistochrone/" visual="https://mathshistory.st-andrews.ac.uk/HistTopics/Brachistochrone/">Brachistochrone
  Problem.</url>
In 1696 the Swiss mathematician Johann Bernoulli published the
statement of the Brachistochrone Problem along with the following
challenge:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
     I, Johann Bernoulli, address the most brilliant
    mathematicians in the world. Nothing is more attractive to
    intelligent people than an honest, challenging problem, whose
    possible solution will bestow fame and remain as a lasting
    monument. Following the example set by Pascal, Fermat, etc., I
    hope to gain the gratitude of the whole scientific community by
    placing before the finest mathematicians of our time a problem
    which will test their methods and the strength of their
    intellect. If someone communicates to me the solution of the
    proposed problem, I shall publicly declare him worthy of praise.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
At the time an acrimonious rivalry existed between Continental and
British mathematicians concerning whether Newton<rsq/>s
<pubtitle>Method of Fluxions</pubtitle> or Leibniz<rsq/>
<foreign>Calculus Differentialis</foreign> was the better approach to
Calculus. Bernoulli didn<rsq/>t believe Newton would be able to solve
the Brachistochrone Problem so the challenge was intended in part to
show that Leibniz<rsq/> approach was better.
</p>

<p>
At that point in his life Newton had stopped doing science. He had
been appointed England<rsq/>s Warden of the Mint and was given the
Herculean task of recalling and replacing all of the country<rsq/>s
coinage.  He had nothing to gain by attempting the problem but the
challenge probably irritated him because he later complained,
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
  I do not love  . . .  to be  . . .  teezed by
    forreigners about Mathematical things.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
According to his niece, Catherine Conduitt,
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
  When the problem in <m>1696</m> was sent by Bernoulli Sir
    I. N. was in the midst of the great recoinage and did not come
    home till four from the Tower very much tired, but did not sleep
    till he had solved it, which was by four in the morning.
</p>
</blockquote>


<p>
Newton submitted his solution anonymously but the presentation was so
uniquely in his style of written mathematics that when he received it
Bernoulli immediately recognized that the solution had come from
Newton because, as he put it,
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>  I know the lion by his claw.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>

Johann Bernoulli also received solutions from his student, the Marquis
de L<rsq/>Hôpital  (whom we will meet again in
<xref ref="CHAPTERlimits-lhop-rule">Chapter</xref>), his older brother Jacob
Bernoulli, and Leibniz. Of course Johann had a solution of his own as
well.

It turned out that the path of least time is an inverted
<url href="https://mathshistory.st-andrews.ac.uk/Curves/Cycloid/" visual="https://mathshistory.st-andrews.ac.uk/Curves/Cycloid/"><term>cycloid</term></url>.
A cycloid is the curve generated by tracing the path of a point on the
edge of a wheel as it rolls in a straight line without slipping, like
the bicycle wheel belwo
</p>
<image source="images/BikeCyc.png" width="50%"/>

<p>
The solution of the the Brachistochrone Problem is a bit beyond the
scope of this course. But its solution, the cycloid curve, had been
studied long before the invention of Calculus. Naturally, the
invention of Calculus gave us a new window on the properties of
cycloids.
</p>

<p>
For example, if you make a bowl whose cross section is an inverted
cycloid then objects sliding to the center (again, we ignore friction)
will take the same length of time to reach the bottom regardless of
their starting position. This is known as the Tautochrone
Problem. <url href="https://mathshistory.st-andrews.ac.uk/Biographies/Huygens/" visual="https://mathshistory.st-andrews.ac.uk/Biographies/Huygens/">Christiaan
  Huygens</url> used this fact to design a better pendulum clock than had
previously existed. This is explored in more depth in

It would be difficult to express the cycloid as the graph of some
curve: <m>y=y(x)</m>. But it is fairly simple to parameterize it, as we
will see in <xref ref="PROBLEMcycloid2">Problem~\</xref>. In our parameterization
<m>\theta</m> will still represent an angle but this time the vertex of the
angle is at the center of the wheel, which is in motion. This makes
the parameterization a little more interesting\aside{Often,
  <q>interesting</q> also means <q>more challenging.</q> }.  The placement
of <m>\theta</m> is shown schematically in the next problem.

Recall that in the <xref ref="PROBLEMSpinCast1">Problem~\</xref> we asserted, without
justification, that the centripetal force holding the spinning, molten
glass in its circular path is given by the formula <m>mr\omega^2</m>. We
now have the tools we need to justify this claim.
</p>
<image source="images/Centripetal2.png" width="30%"/>

<p>
If an object having mass <m>m</m>, is revolving in a circle of radius <m>r</m>
meters around an axis with an angular velocity of <m>\omega</m>
radians/second, the centripetal force that keeps it moving in a circle
is directed toward the center of the circle. Anything moving in a
circular path is held on course by a centripetal or <q>center seeking</q>
force.
</p>
<p>

Recall that force and acceleration are related by Newton<rsq/>s Second Law
of Motion: <m>\text{force}=\text{mass}\times\text{acceleration}.</m> Thus
to show that the force is what we said it was we<rsq/>ll need to show that
the centripetal acceleration is given by <m>r\omega^2</m>.

<problem xml:id="PROBLEMSpinCastCentripetalForce">

<title>DIGRESSION: The Centripetal and Tangential Forces</title>
<p>
  In <xref ref="PROBLEMSpinCastCentripetalForce"></xref> we assumed the
  angular velocity, <m>\left(\dfdx{\theta}{t}=\omega\right)</m> was
  constant, so that we could focus our attention on the centripetal
  force that keeps the point <m>P</m> moving in a circle.
 
              In <xref ref="PROBLEMSpinCastCentripetalForce"></xref> only the
  centripetal force was in play.  But consider a model airplane flying
  at the end of a cord, as in the sketch below.
</p>  
<image source="images/CentAccDecomp3.png" width="30%" />
<!-- \centerline{\includegraphics*[height=2in,width=2in]{../Figures/CentAccDecomp3}} -->
<p>

  Now we have two forces to contend
  with. The tension in the cord (shown in red) supplies the
  centripetal (center seeking) force, while the force of the engine (thrust) will
  always be in the direction of motion, tangential to the path at <m>P</m>
  (shown in blue). Since the airplane will speed up or slow down
  depending on the magnitude of the thrust the airplane is no longer
  constrained to fly at a constant angular velocity.
</p>

  Finding an expression for the centripetal and tangential
  acceleration is a straightforward, though somewhat daunting,
  exercise in differentiation.

<p>
  <xref ref="DRILLCentripetaAcclDecomposition">
    </xref> suggests that the red
    terms in <xref ref="EQUATIONHorizAccel">equations</xref> <xref ref="EQUATIONVertAccel">and</xref> are the
    horizontal and vertical components of the centripetal acceleration.
    If that is true (it is) then the blue terms must represent the
    tangential acceleration.  Thus, by Newton<rsq/>s Second Law, we obtain the
    horizontal and vertical components of the tangential force by
    multiplying the horizontal and vertical accelerations by <m>m</m>.  This

<p>
  Finally, we let <m>s(t)</m> represent the length of the circular arc
  traced by <m>P</m> at time <m>t</m>. Since <m>\theta</m> is measured in radians we
  know that the length of a circular arc, <m>s</m> is <m>s=r\theta</m>.
  Applying the Constant Multiple Rule  we see that
  <m>
  \dx{s}=r\dfdx{\theta}{t}\dx{t}.
  </m>
  Since <m>\dx{s}</m> represents an infinitesimal  displacement tangent to the circle we see that
  <me>
  \dfdx{s}{t}=r\dfdx{\theta}{t}
  </me>
  is the tangential velocity of the
  airplane.
</p>
<p>

  Differentiating again using the Constant Multiple Rule we see that
  <me>
  \dfdxn{s}{t}{2}=\dfdxn{(r\theta)}{t}{2} =r\dfdxn{\theta}{t}{2}.
  </me> is the tangential acceleration.  So <xref

<md>

  \dfdxn{x}{t}{2}\amp =

    In this form these equations express the relationship between the

Much of what occurs in the real world recurs periodically. As we saw

repeats periodically every few seconds. Can you think of other
examples of periodic behavior in the natural world?

The usefulness of the trigonometric functions, especially the sine and
cosine, comes from the fact that they are also periodic. With enough
effort the sine and cosine functions can be used to model any periodic

The classical physical example of a simple harmonic oscillator is an

In this sketch the horizontal axis is time so it shows the
same bouncing spring at three different times. Assume that our spring
is anchored in some way at the top. When the weight of the object and
the restoring force of the spring balance exactly we say that they are
in equilibrium as illustrated by the leftmost spring in our sketch.

  Hooke</url> (1635<ndash/>1703), who we encountered back in
<xref ref="SECTIONbridg-chains-telesc">Section</xref>, was a leading elder
scientist when Newton was young and a rising star in English science.
Hooke was the first to show that the restoring force exerted by a
spring (the force back toward equilibrium) is directly proportional to
the length of its extension beyond equilibrium.  This is known today
as <term>Hooke’s Law for Springs</term> (or just <term>Hooke<rsq/>s Law</term>) and it
is true whether the spring is stretched or compressed.

<p>
If we let <m>y=y(t)</m> denote the vertical displacement of the mass from
equilibrium then Hooke<rsq/>s Law says that the restoring force of the
spring is given by <m>-ky</m>, for some positive constant <m>k</m> (called the
<term>spring constant</term>). For a relatively weak spring, <m>k</m> would have
a small value. For a relatively strong spring, the value of <m>k</m> would
be large. If we let <m>F</m> represent the restoring force acting on the
hanging mass then we have
<me>
F=-ky.
</me>
Since the spring constant, <m>k</m>, is positive the negative sign in front
of <m>k</m> is necessary. But it is easy to misinterpret this. The negative
sign does not mean that the force <m>F</m> is always negative (upward in
our diagram).  In the analysis above the sign of <m>F</m> will be the
negative (opposite) of the direction of the displacement of <m>y</m>. If
the spring is displaced in the positive direction (stretched downward
in our diagram) then the <m>-k</m> in front guarantees that the force, <m>F</m>,
will be negative (upward). Conversely if we displace the spring in the
negative direction (compressed upward in the diagram) then the <m>-k</m>
guarantees that <m>F</m> is positive.
</p>
<p>
As we have seen  the acceleration of an
object is the second derivative of its position with respect to time,
or <m>\dfdxn{y}{t}{2}</m>. Thus according to Newton’s Second Law, the force
acting on our mass will satisfy <m>F=m\dfdxn{y}{t}{2}</m>.  Finally, since
<m>F</m> represents the same force in both Hooke<rsq/>s Law and Newton's Second
Law, we see that the vertical displacement of our mass must satisfy
the equation
<men  xml:id="EQUATIONSHO2">

  point. At equilibrium the upward force from the spring exactly
  balances the downward force of gravity (that<rsq/>s why it's called
  equilibrium) so we can proceed as if those forces are not
  there. This does not say that there are no other forces acting on
  the object, only that such forces as exist are exactly in balance;
  they add to zero.

<title>The Differentials of the Other Trigonometric Functions</title>

<p>
Once the differential of <m>\sin(x)</m> is known, the differentials of the
other trigonometric functions are easily computed. Since our current
goal is simply to develop the tools we will need later we will not
spend any more time on this than necessary.
</p>
<p>

Observe that by definition <m>\tan(x)=\frac{\sin(x)}{\cos(x)}</m>, so the
Quotient Rule applies:
<md>
<mrow>
  \dx\left(\tan(x)\right) \amp = \dx{\left(\frac{\sin(x)}{\cos(x)}\right)}
</mrow>
<mrow>  \amp =  \frac{\cos(x)\dx(\sin(x))-\sin(x)\dx(\cos(x))}{\cos^2(x)}</mrow>
<mrow>
  \amp = \frac{\cos^2(x)\dx{x}
  +\sin^2(x)\dx{x}}{\cos^2(x)}
</mrow>
<mrow>  \amp = \frac{1}{\cos^2(x)}\dx{x}</mrow>
</md>
and since <m>\sec(x) = 1/\cos(x)</m> we have
 <me> \dx{\left(\tan(x)\right)}  = \sec^2(x)\dx{x}.</me>
</p>

<exercise>
<statement>
<p>
  Use the Quotient Rule to show that
  <m> \dx{(\cot(x))} = -\csc^2(x)\dx{x}.  </m>
</p>
</statement>
</exercise>

<p>
Observe that by definition
<m>\sec(x) = \frac{1}{\cos x} = \inverse{(\cos(x))}</m>. Differentiating,
we have
<me>\dx(\sec(x)) = \dx\left(\inverse{(\underbrace{\cos(
      x)}_{=z})}\right),</me> and making the substitution <m>z=\cos(x)</m> as
indicated we have <m>\dx(\sec(x)) = \dx(\inverse{z})</m>. By the Power Rule
this is
<me>
\dx(\sec(x)) = -z^{-2}\dx{z} =-\left(\cos(x)\right)^{-2}\dx(\cos(x)) =
-(\cos(x))^{-2}(-\sin(x))\dx{x}.
</me>
Simplifying gives
<me>
  \dx(\sec(x)) = \frac{\sin(x)}{\cos^2(x)}\dx{x}
  = \frac{1}{\cos(x)}\cdot\frac{\sin(x)}{\cos(x)}\dx x
  </me>
  so that, finally we have
  <me>
  \dx{(\sec(x))}   = \sec(x)\tan(x)\dx{x}.
</me>
</p>
<exercise>
<statement>
<p>
  By similar means show that
<m>  \dx{(\csc(x))} = -\csc(x)\cot(x)\dx{x}</m>.
</p>
</statement>
</exercise>
<p>
Remember all of those identities you had to memorize in Trigonometry?
You can reduce that memorization burden a bit by using Calculus. If
two variable quantities are equal then their differentials must be
equal too. So if you differentiate both sides an identity you get
another identity!
</p>
<example>
<p>
  Consider the double angle formula for the sine function:
  <me> \sin(2x)=2\sin(x)\cos(x)</me>.  Differentiating gives
  <me> \cos(2x)\dx x = \cos^2(x)\dx x -\sin^2(x)\dx x</me> or
  <men  xml:id="EQUATIONCosDouble">
    \cos(2x)
    =\cos^2(x)-\sin^2(x).
<!-- \label{eq:CosDouble} -->
</men>
  which is the double angle formula for the cosine function.
</p>
</example>

<example xml:id="Sin2Cos2">
<p>

  <!-- \label{Sin2Cos2} -->
  We know that <m>\sin^2(x)+\cos^2(x)=1</m> no matter what value <m>x</m> has,
  so we<rsq/>d expect that differential of <m>\sin^2(x)+\cos^2(x)</m> to be
  zero. Let<rsq/>s check.
</p>
<p>

  By the Sum Rule
  <me> \dx(\sin^2(x)+\cos^2(x)) = \dx(\sin^2(x)) + \dx(\cos^2(x))</me> and by
  the Power Rule we have
  <md>
<mrow> \dx(\sin^2(x)+\cos^2(x))   \amp = 2\sin(x)\dx(\sin(x)) + 2\cos(x)\dx(\cos(x))</mrow>
<mrow>    \amp = 2\sin(x)\cos(x)\dx{x} + 2\cos(x)(-\sin(x))\dx x</mrow>
<mrow>    \amp = 2(\sin(x)\cos(x) - \sin(x)\cos(x))\dx x</mrow>
<mrow>    \amp = 0.</mrow>
</md>

</p>
</example>

<exercise>
<statement>
<p>
  Since the sine and cosine functions are both differentiable and
  <m>\dx{(\sin^2(x)+\cos^2(x))}=0</m> we can conclude that
  <m>\sin^2(x)+\cos^2(x)</m> is (probably) equal to some
  constant. If we didn<rsq/>t already know, how could we conclude that the
  constant is <m>1?</m>
</p>
</statement>
</exercise>

<p>
We now know the differentials of all of the trigonometric functions.
These are shown in the table below. Memorize
them.

<title>The Inverse Tangent and Cotangent Functions </title>

<p>
If <m>x</m> is the tangent of <m>y</m>, <m>x=\tan(y)</m>, then we say that <m>y</m> is the
<term>arctangent</term> of <m>x</m>, <m>y=\arctan{x}</m>. Speaking loosely, we<rsq/>d like
for the arctangent to be a function which <q>undoes</q> the tangent.
</p>

<image source="images/arctan3.png" width="60%" />
 <!-- \centerline{\includegraphics*[height=2.2in,width=5.5in]{../Figures/arctan3}} -->

<p>

The sketch above shows the graph of <m>y=\tan(x)</m> (in red) and the same
graph (in blue) reflected about the graph of the line <m>y=x</m> (dashed,
in black). Reflecting in this manner swaps the coordinates of each
point. For example, the point <m>(\pi, 0)</m> is on the graph of
<m>y=\tan(x)</m>, because <m>\tan\left(\pi\right)=0</m>. Similarly, the point
<m>\left(0,\pi\right)</m> is on the graph of <m>y=\arctan(x)</m>.
</p>
<p>

But is it true that <m>\arctan(0)=\pi</m>? If we are to believe our graph,
it could be true. But couldn<rsq/>t it also be true that <m>\arctan(0)=2\pi</m>,
or even <m>\arctan(0)=-\pi</m>?  The blue graph above is clearly the graph
of the arctangent as we have defined it but we seem to have a choice
for the output of <m>\arctan(x)</m>. Many choices, in fact.
</p>
<p>

Having more than one output for a given input clearly violates what we
mean when we use the word <q>function.</q>  A mathematical function
returns exactly one output for a given input. There is no
choice. The sketch of the arctangent (in blue) is not the graph of a
<term>function</term>. It is the graph of the <term>multifunction</term>
<m>\arctan(x)</m>. Each of the blue curves on the right is one
<term>branch</term> of the multifunction,
<m>\arctan(x)</m>. In fact all of the <q>arc</q> functions from trigonometry
are multifunctions.  Multfunctions are interesting objects and are
well worth studying.  But this is not the time for that study. Right
now we are only interested in the properties of the <term>inverse
  function</term> of <m>\tan(x)</m>. Since <m>\arctan(x)</m> is not a function, it
can<rsq/>t be the inverse function of <m>\tan(x)</m> so we will stop thinking
about it as soon as we can.
</p>
<aside>
<title>Mathematical Terminology</title>
<p>
Note that by itself, any
  single branch of the arctangent is a function.
</p>
</aside>

<p>

But if <m>\arctan(x)</m> is not the inverse of <m>\tan(x)</m> what is? Since we
only allow one output for a given input, could it be as simple as
choosing just one of the branches of the <m>\arctan(x)</m>, say the one
that lies between <m>y=-\frac{\pi}{2}</m> and
<m>y=\frac{\pi}{2}</m>, shown below, and calling it the the inverse of  <m>\tan(x)</m>?
</p>

<image source="images/arctan5.png" width="60%" />
 <!-- \centerline{\includegraphics*[height=2.7in,width=4.5in]{../Figures/arctan5}}  -->

<p>
Actually, yes. It is just that simple. And the usual choice is the one
we<rsq/>ve indicated.  In this text we will designate this branch of
<m>\arctan(x)</m> with <m>\inverse\tan(x)</m>. Thus <m>\inverse\tan(x)</m> denotes
the <term>inverse tangent</term> function. Because the multifunction
arctangent is not a function we will henceforth ignore it as much as
possible.
</p>

<paragraphs  xml:id="DIGRESSIONInverse-function-notation">
<title>DIGRESSION: Inverse Function Notation</title>

  <!-- \label{DIGRESSION} -->
<p>  
The use of <m>-1</m> as an exponent is probably the most common
notation used to indicate function inversion. Unfortunately, from the
standpoint of a student it is also probably the worst notation we
could have possibly invented because It is so very easily confused
with reciprocation. While it is true that
  <men  xml:id="EQUATIONNegOneRecip">

    <!-- \label{eq:NegOneRecip} -->
    2^{-1} = \frac12,
  
</men>
  it is important to remember that
  <men  xml:id="EQUATIONNegOneInv">

    <!-- \label{eq:NegOneInv} -->
    \inverse{\tan}(x) \text{ is not equal to } \frac{1}{\tan(x)}.
  
</men>
</p>
<p>

  That the <q><m>-1</m></q> notation is used for both comes from the fact that
  both <m>2^{-1}</m> and <m>\inverse\sin(x)</m> really are inverses. But they
  are different kinds of inverses: <m>\inverse2</m> is the
  multiplicative inverse of <m>2</m>, which means simply that
  <me>\frac12\cdot2=1 \text{ and that } 2\cdot\frac12 =1.</me>
  On the other hand <m>\inverse\tan(x)</m> is the functional inverse
  of <m>x=\tan(y)</m>, which means that if
  <m>-\frac{\pi}{2}\lt x\lt \frac{\pi}{2}</m> then
  <me>
  \inverse\tan(\tan(x)) = x,
  </me>
  and that
  <me>
  \tan(\inverse\tan(x))=x.
  </me>
</p>
<p>

  In <xref ref="EQUATIONNegOneRecip">equation</xref> you can think of the <m>-1</m> in the
  exponent as an operator. It operates on <m>2</m> by taking its
  reciprocal: <m>\inverse{2}=\frac12</m>. In <xref ref="EQUATIONNegOneInv">equation</xref>
  the <m>-1</m> is not an operator. It is part of the symbol,
  <m>\inverse\tan</m>, that we use to denote the inverse tangent.
</p>
<p>
  
  With practice this all gets easier, but in the beginning it is very
  troublesome. Be careful.

<p>

But what, exactly, is <m>\inverse\tan(x)</m> the inverse of? From the
sketch above it should be clear that restricting the <alert>range</alert> of
<m>\inverse\tan(x)</m> to values in the interval <m>(-\pi/2, \pi/2)</m> forced
us to restrict the <alert>domain</alert> of <m>\tan(x)</m>. So
<me>
\inverse\tan(x) \text{ with domain all real numbers, } (\RR)
</me>
is the inverse of
<m>
\tan(x) \text{ with domain, } (-\pi/2, \pi/2),
</m>
and it is not the inverse of
<m>
\tan(x) \text{ with domain, } \RR
</m>
because that function has no inverse.
</p>
<p>

An easy way to remember what <m>\inverse{\tan}(x)</m> means is to read the
symbol <m>\inverse{\tan}(x)</m> as
<q>the angle whose tangent is <m>x</m>.</q>
</p>
<p>
The
advantage of this phrasing is that it emphasizes that <m>x</m> is the
tangent of some angle, and <m>\inverse{\tan}(x)</m> is that
angle. Similarly the inverse functions of the other trigonometric
functions should be
read as <q>the angle whose sine, cosine, secant, (or whatever) is
  <m>x</m>.</q>  Each of these will also come with suitable restrictions on
its range.
</p>
<p>

We should point out that reserving the <q>arc</q> notation for the
trigonometric multifunctions is actually a conceit of the authors of
this text. Most of the world uses <m>\arctan(x)</m> and <m>\inverse\tan(x)</m>
interchangeably, and eventually you will too. But for now it will be
helpful for you to keep in mind that the difference between them is
that restricting the range  of   <m>\inverse\tan(x)</m>  to
<m>-\frac{\pi}{2}\lt x\lt\frac{\pi}{2}</m> guarantees that it is a
function. But since the range of   <m>\arctan(x)</m> is not similarly
restricted it is not
a function.
</p>
<p>

</p>

<exercise>
<statement>
<p>
  Suppose we had chosen
  <m>\frac{\pi}{2}\lt \inverse\tan(x)\lt \frac{3\pi}{2}</m>. What
  function (with domain) is that the inverse of?
</p>
</statement>
</exercise>
<p>
All of this fussiness is really just about making our abstract
definitions useful and consistent. It would be nice if these details
only impinged on us in an abstract setting but unfortunately some
practical difficulties do come up, as the following drill shows.
</p>


<problem>
<statement>

  <m>x=\inverse\tan\left(1\right)</m>. Do they have the same set of
  solutions?
</p>
</statement>
<hint>
<p>
Obviously, they do not. Otherwise we wouldn<rsq/>t have asked the
    question. What is the difference between the two sets of
    solutions?
</p>
</hint>
</problem>


<paragraphs  xml:id="DIGRESSIONTanNoInv">
<title>DIGRESSION: The Tangent Function Has No Inverse</title>
<p>
  The function <m>\tan(x)</m> is not invertible. This is because, by
  custom, its domain is all real numbers (except <m>\frac\pi2, \pm\pi,
  \pm2\pi, \pm3\pi, \cdots.</m>) . Thus it is <alert>not</alert> the
  same function as <me>\tan(x) \text{ with domain } -\frac{\pi}{2}\lt
  x\lt \frac{\pi}{2}.</me> A function has two parts: (1) The set of
  inputs (domain) and (2) the rule associating input with output. Most
  of the time the domain is the set of all real numbers (<m>\RR</m>),
  so we don<rsq/>t bother to explicitly state that the domain of, say
  <m>f(x)=x^2</m> is <m>\RR</m> . Unless otherwise specified we simply
  assume that it is.  Properly speaking, we should always specify the
  domain of our functions, but typically we don<rsq/>t. The custom is to
  assume that the domain of a function is <m>\RR</m> unless otherwise
  stated.  Thus the function, <m>\tan(x)</m> cannot be inverted
  because on its domain (<m>\RR</m>) it has more than one branch.
</p>

<p>
  Because we both want and need an inverse tangent function we
  restrict the range of <m>\inverse\tan(x)</m>. But this is the inverse of
  <m>\tan(x)</m>, with domain <m>-\frac{\pi}{2}\lt x\lt \frac{\pi}{2}</m>,
  which has only one branch. It is <alert>not</alert> the inverse of
  <m>\tan(x)</m>, because it has too many branches.
</p>

<p>
  To use our notation as it was intended to be used we should
  say that <m>\inverse\tan(x)</m> is the inverse of <m>\tan(x)</m>, with domain
  <m>-\frac{\pi}{2}\lt x\lt \frac{\pi}{2}</m>, which is true. But
  instead, we typically just say that it is the inverse of <m>\tan(x)</m>,
  which strictly speaking, is not true.
</p>

<p>
  When we (mathematicians) talk amongst ourselves this is not a
  problem. We all understand what we mean. But it can be very
  confusing for students who usually have a more tenuous grasp of
  these distinctions.  It is a bit unfair of us (mathematicians) to
  speak to students in what amount to incomplete sentences, but we
  tend to do it anyway, mostly out of habit.
</p>

<p>
  We (the authors) apologize.

The definition of the arccotangent is similar to the definition of the
arctangent: If <m>x</m> is the cotangent of <m>y</m>, <m>x=\cot(y)</m>, then we say
that <m>y</m> is the <term>arccotangent</term> of <m>x</m>, and write <me>y=\arccot(x).</me> The
arccotangent is also a multifunction with multiple branches so, just
as before, we will have to decide which branch to use to define the
inverse cotangent: <m>\inverse\cot(x)</m>.
</p>
<p>

We obtained our branch for the single-valued function
<m>y=\inverse\tan(x)</m> from the multifunction <m>y=\arctan(x)</m> by
restricting its range to <m>-\frac{\pi}{2}\lt y\lt\frac{\pi}{2}</m>. A
similar restriction would allow us to obtain the single-valued
function <m>\inverse\cot(x)</m> from the multifunction <m>\arccot(x)</m>, but it
is a bit simpler to once again use a trigonometric identity.

very lucky. Her brilliance and talent were recognized early and
nurtured by her wealthy father, who encouraged her studies and
provided her with the best possible tutors to develop her talents. She
mastered the Calculus of Newton and Leibniz and in <m>1748</m> wrote a
series of textbooks on the topic titled

    Analitiche ad Uso Della Gioventù Italiana</url>
( <pubtitle>Analytical Methods for the use of
      Italian Youth</pubtitle>). It was immediately recognized as a masterpiece
of mathematical exposition and was used throughout Europe during
eighteenth century. It was by far the most popular Calculus textbook
in use at the time.  An Englishman,
<url href="https://mathshistory.st-andrews.ac.uk/Biographies/Colson/" visual="https://mathshistory.st-andrews.ac.uk/Biographies/Colson/">John
  Colson</url>, was so impressed with Agnesi<rsq/>s work that in 1760 he took
it upon himself to learn Italian specifically so that he could
translate her text into English.

<aside>
  <title>Pronunciation</title>
  <p>
    Her name is pronounced <q>Awn-yes-ee,</q> not <q>Ag-nes-ee.</q>
  </p>
</aside>

<p>
In her text Agnesi collected many of the known results of the time and
organized them for the instruction of students. The Latin name of one
of the curves that she used for instruction is <foreign>versoria</foreign> (<q>rope
that turns a sail</q>) because of its shape. Agnesi correctly translated
this into Italian as <q>la versiera.</q>  Unfortunately Colson mistook
this for <q>l<rsq/>aversiera</q> which means <q>witch.</q> As a result this
particular curve has been known ever since as the Witch of Agnesi.

As modern function notation was yet to be invented Agnesi understood
this curve geometrically as a particular set of points. In the diagram
below think of <m>P</m> as moving from left to right. For each value
of <m>x_0</m>, draw the line from the origin to <m>P</m> and locate the vertical
coordinate <m>y_0</m> where this line intersects the circle
<me>x^2+ \left( y-\frac12 \right)^2=\left(\frac12\right)^2,</me>
centered at <m>\left(0, \frac12\right)</m>, with radius <m>r=\frac12</m>.  Every
point <m>(x_0,y_0)</m> is a point on the Witch of Agnesi. The Witch itself
is the curve shown in red.

<p>
  In the diagram above show that the coordinates <m>x_0</m> and <m>y_0</m>

  the graph of
  <me>  y(x)=\frac{1}{1+x^2}.  </me>

<p>

Computing the derivative of a function as a formula is very
useful. This has in fact been our primary focus so far in this
text. However to truly understand the relationship between a function
and its derivative nothing can replace seeing both of them graphed
together.  Look closely at the relationship between the Witch and its
derivative in the sketch at the right. Is it clear how these graphs
are related?
</p>
<image source="images/Witch3.png" width="60%"/>

<p>
Notice in particular that when <m>x=0</m> the <m>y</m> coordinate of the Witch
is at its highest point (maximum value), whereas the <m>y</m> coordinate of
<m>\dfdx{(\text{Witch})}{x}</m> is zero.
</p>
<p>

We know that the derivative of a curve at a given point gives us the
slope of the line tangent at that point. Thus at the highest point of
the Witch the line tangent to it will be horizontal.  That is, the
derivative of the Witch will be zero. This is exactly what these two
graphs are showing us.
</p>
<p>

When <m>x</m> is just to the right of zero, the slope of the Witch is close
to zero and negative. Similarly just to the left of zero the slope of
the Witch is close to zero and positive. At the extreme right end of
the graph above the slope of the Witch is close to zero and negative
and at the extreme left it is close to zero and positive. And all of
this is reflected in the shape of the blue (derivative) curve.
</p>
<p>

It is a little more interesting to reverse this process. That is,
suppose we could see only the derivative of the Witch (blue
curve). Could we figure out the shape of the Witch from this?
</p>
<p>

Sure we can. Well, almost.
</p>
<p>

Consider: From the extreme left of the graph to <m>x=0</m> the
<m>y-</m>coordinate of the (blue) derivative curve is above the
<m>x-</m>axis. Therefore the slope of the Witch is positive. Clearly
wherever the slope of a function is positive the function is
increasing, so we can deduce that the Witch increases from left to
right until we reach <m>x=0</m> where the blue derivative function crosses
the <m>x</m>-axis.
</p>
<p>

Thereafter the <m>y</m><ndash/>coordinate of the blue derivative curve is below
the <m>x</m><ndash/>axis. That is, the slope of the Witch is negative, so the
Witch is decreasing.
</p>
<p>

Just by looking at the derivative curve we can see that the Witch of
Agnesi increases from left to right until we reach <m>x=0,</m> and
after that it decreases. Although this shows us the shape of the Witch
we do not have enough information to completely describe the Witch of
Agnesi. We can tell a lot about a curve by looking at the graph of its
derivative but we can<rsq/>t tell everything.
</p>

<exercise xml:id="DRILLNonUniqueAntiderivative">
<statement>
<p>
  In the sketch below the red curve is the graph of the Witch and the
  blue curve is the graph of its derivative. Convince yourself that
  the blue curve could also be the graph of the derivative of any of
  the other curves shown as well. As clearly as you can, explain what
  this suggests about the relationship between a
  function and its derivative.

<!-- \centerline{\includegraphics*[height=1.5in,width=3in]{../Figures/Witch11}} -->
</statement>
</exercise>
<p>
Next we<rsq/>d like to apply this same sort of reasoning to the Witch
itself.  We<rsq/>d like to answer the question, <q>What curve is the Witch
of Agnesi the derivative of?</q>  Whatever that curve is, we<rsq/>ll call it
the <term>antiderivative</term> of the Witch for obvious reasons.
</p>
      
<image source="images/Witch6.png" width="60%" />
 <!-- \centerline{\includegraphics*[height=1.5in,width=3in]{../Figures/Witch6}} -->

<p>
As before, by simply looking at the graph of the Witch we can see
that: (1) At the extreme ends of its graph the antiderivative will
have a positive slope which gets closer and closer to zero as
we go farther from the origin, but (2) since the Witch never crosses
the <m>x</m>-axis the antiderivative will never have a horizontal slope,
and (3) at <m>x=0</m> the slope of the antiderivative will be equal to
one. A sketch of the antiderivative of the Witch begins to emerge when
we put
these three observations into our graph:
</p>
<image source="images/Witch7.png" width="60%" />
 <!-- \centerline{\includegraphics*[height=1.5in,width=3in]{../Figures/Witch7}} -->
<p>
Continuing to fill between the black segments in the same fashion
the sketch becomes even clearer:
</p>

<image source="images/Witch8.png" width="60%" />
 <!-- \centerline{\includegraphics*[height=1.8in,width=3in]{../Figures/Witch8}} -->
<p>
Finally, connecting the dots with a smooth curve we see the the
graph of the antiderivative of the Witch of Agnesi must look like this:
</p>

<image source="images/Witch9.png" width="60%" />
 <!-- \centerline{\includegraphics*[height=1.75in,width=3.6in]{../Figures/Witch9}} -->
<p>
We<rsq/>ve been a little lazy with our use of language.  As we saw in
<xref ref="DRILLNonUniqueAntiderivative"></xref>, the antiderivative is not
unique, so it is improper to speak of the antiderivative. Any
one of the curves shown below could be an antiderivative of the
Witch of Agnesi. (Except the black one, of course. That<rsq/>s the Witch.)
</p>
<image source="images/arctan1.png" width="60%" />
 <!-- \centerline{\includegraphics*[height=1.8in,width=3in]{../Figures/arctan1}} -->
<p>

This graph should look very familiar to you. It looks very much like
the graph of the arctangent function we discussed in
<xref ref="SECTIONinverse-tan-and-cot">Section</xref>, doesn<rsq/>t it? Do you suppose it
is possible that the derivative of the arctangent function is the
Witch of Agnesi?
</p>
<p>

Of course it is. Why else would we have led you down this path? But
there are some subtleties here that we shouldn<rsq/>t ignore. For example
we will want to find a function that is the antiderivative of the
Witch. We will proceed cautiously.
</p>
<p>

The following exercise is not directly
related to the Witch of Agnesi. We include it so that you can get
practice relating the graphs of functions, there derivatives, and
their antiderivatives, as this is a very useful skill. We will need it
in a far more substantial way in
<xref ref="SECTIONgraph-without-form"></xref> when we get there.

<p>
Since we want to find a function whose derivative is the Witch of
Agnesi and we are pretty sure that each of the branches of the
arctangent multifunction takes the shape of the Witch<rsq/>s antiderivative it
is tempting to assume that the branch of the arctangent shown belwo is the function we are looking for.
</p>
<image source="images/arctan6.png" width="60%"/>
<p>
In fact, this is correct, but we must be careful.  Reasoning from
pictures, as we<rsq/>ve just done, can be very useful.  but the most
we can hope for when reasoning from pictures is an intuitive feel for
the problem. We always need to confirm our intuition
analytically. Always.
</p>

<p>
So we will verify, analytically, our conjecture that the derivative of
the inverse tangent function is the Witch of Agnesi.

From our definition of <m>\inverse\tan(x)</m> we know that
<m> y=\inverse\tan(x)</m> precisely when\aside{Notice how cavalierly we<rsq/>ve
  ignored the necessary constraints on the domain of the
  tangent. The function <m>\inverse\tan(x)</m> is not the inverse of
  <m>\tan(x)</m> because the domain of <m>\tan(x)</m> is <m>\RR</m>. It is the
  inverse of <m>\tan(x)</m>, with domain,
  <m>\frac{-\pi}{2}\lt x \lt\frac{\pi}{2}</m>. The domain is part of the
  definition of the function.} <m>\tan(y)=x</m>.  Differentiating
<m>\tan(y)=x</m> gives:
<md>
<mrow>

  \dx(\tan(y)) \amp = \dx{x}
</mrow>
<mrow>
  \sec^2(y)\dx{y} \amp = \dx{x}
</mrow>
<mrow>  \dx{y}\amp = \frac{1}{\sec^2(y)}\dx{x}.
</mrow>
</md>

</p>

<!-- \begin{wrapfigure}[]{r}{2.3in} -->

<!--   \centerline{\includegraphics*[height=2.3in,width=2.3in]{../Figures/arctanMnemonic2}} -->
<!--   \label{fig:arctanMnemonic2} -->
<!-- \end{wrapfigure} -->
<p>

This is a correct formula for the differential of the arctangent
function. However, there are two problems: (1) it does not seem to
match our conjecture, and (2) even if it is correct this formula will
not be very useful to us in this form since we have <m>\dx{y}</m> in terms
of <m>y</m> itself. We can address both of these problems by finding
<m>\dx{y}</m> in terms of <m>x</m> and <m>\dx{x}</m>.
</p>

<image source="images/arctanMnemonic2.png" width="30%"/>
<p>
Referring to the diagram above, recall from
<xref ref="SECTIONtrig-interl"></xref> that <m>\tan(y)=\frac{x}{1}=x</m> so
<m>y=\inverse\tan(x)</m>. The hypotenuse in the diagram at the right is
<m>\sec(y)</m> so from the Pythagorean Theorem we see that
<m>\sec^2(y)=1+x^2</m>.  Thus
<me>
\dx{y}=\frac{1}{\sec^2(y)}\dx{x}=\frac{1}{1+x^2}\dx{x},
</me>
or
<me>
\dfdx{y}{x}=\frac{1}{1+x^2}
</me>
So our intuition was correct. The Witch is indeed the derivative of
the arctangent function.  A similar derivation can be used for the
arccotangent.

Despite how much time we spent talking about them, the single valued
branches for <m>y=\inverse\tan(x)</m> and <m>y=\inverse\cot(x)</m>, were
actually fairly apparent from the graphs of <m>x=\tan(y)</m> and
<m>x=\cot(y)</m>. All we had to do was choose one continuous branch from
either graph. We described the process carefully because for the other
inverse trigonometric functions things are a little more
problematic. For those we will have to use the derivatives of our
<q>arc</q> multifunctions as a guide, rather than the multifunctions
themselves.
</p>

In general, we define an arcfunction as <m>\text{arcfunction}(x)=y</m>
precisely when <m>\text{function}(y)=x</m>. So, <m>\arcsin(x)=y</m> when
<m>\sin(y)=x</m> and <m>\arccos(x)=y</m> when <m>\cos(x)=y</m>.

When we graph <m>\arcsin(x)</m> by flipping the graph of <m>\sin(x)</m> across
the graph of the line <m>y=x</m> we get the sketch below. For the
value of <m>x</m> shown in the sketch the arrows point to a few of the
possible values of <m>\arcsin(x)</m>. There are infinitely many, so
obviously <m>\arcsin(x)</m> is also a multifunction, not a function.

<p>

The plus/minus and minus/plus that appear in
<xref ref="EQUATIONInvSin11">equations</xref> and <xref ref="EQUATIONInvCos1"></xref>, respectively, are
present because, <m>\arcsin(x)</m> and <m>\arccos(x)</m> are both multifunctions
like <m>\arctan(x)</m>.
</p>
<p>

Since <m>\arcsin(x)</m> is not a function at all it can<rsq/>t be the inverse
function of <m>\sin(x)</m>.  Once again, to <em>create</em> an inverse
sine function (which we will call <m>\inverse\sin(x)</m>) we will have to
restrict the range of <m>\inverse\sin(x)</m> just like we restricted the
range of <m>\inverse\tan(x)</m>.  The question is, what restriction should
we impose?
</p>
<p>




When we were looking to restrict the range of the <m>\inverse\tan(x)</m>
there was a natural choice that was clearly visible in the
graph. Notice that the derivative of <m>\arctan(x)</m> (and thus the
derivative of <m>\inverse\tan(x)</m>) is always positive while the
derivative of the <m>\arccot(x)</m> (and thus the derivative of
<m>\inverse\cot(x)</m>) is always negative. This happens naturally for the
tangent and cotangent, but not for the arcsine, the arccosine or the
other trigonometric functions.
</p>

<p>

But this does suggest how we might proceed. As you can see in the
sketch at the right the slope of <m>\arcsin(x)</m> is sometimes positive
and sometimes negative. Since we must restrict the range of
<m>\inverse\sin(x)</m>, we may as well make a convenient choice.  We<rsq/>d like
to constrain the range of the inverse sine in such a way that its
derivative is always positive, and we<rsq/>d like to constrain the range of
the inverse cosine in such a way that its derivative is always
negative.
</p>

<p>
From the sketch we see that if we restrict the range of
<m>\inverse\sin(x)</m> to the interval <m>[-\pi/2, \pi/2]</m> the graph of
<m>\inverse\sin(x)</m> (in blue) will always\aside{Except at the
  endpoints of course. What do you think the slope of
  <m>\inverse\sin(x)</m> is at <m>x=\frac{\pi}{2}</m>? have a positive slope,
and therefore a positive derivative.
</p>
<p>

With this restriction in place we define the derivative of the
inverse sine as follows.

<p>

Again we will want to define the inverse secant, <m>y=\inverse\sec(x)</m>
by restricting the range of the multifunction <m>y=\arcsec(x)</m> in such a
way that the derivative of <m>\inverse\sec(x)</m> will always be
positive. Similarly for the inverse cosecant function.
</p>
<p>

But forcing the derivative of the inverse secant to always be positive
is a bit harder for a couple of reasons. The first is just that these
functions are used less and thus we are not as familiar with them.
The other is the nature of the derivative formula itself. Recall that
<me>
\dfdx{(\arcsec(x))}{x}=\frac{\pm1}{x\sqrt{x^2-1}}.
</me>
This time it is the presence of the <m>x</m> in the denominator along
  with the <m>\pm1</m> in the numerator that is troublesome. By choosing
the range constraint judiciously we can control whether the plus or
the minus is chosen in the numerator but any reasonable constraint on
the range of <m>\inverse\sec(x)</m> will always include both
positive and negative numbers in its domain. So the <m>x</m> in the
denominator will make the derivative of <m>\inverse\sec(x)</m> positive for
some values and negative for others. We don<rsq/>t want that. We want it to
be positive.
</p>
<p>

Usually when we want things in the world to be simple, Nature just
laughs at us. But not this time. This time the problem is simply that
we have too many choices.  Both the <m>\pm1</m> in the numerator and the
<m>x</m> in the denominator will influence the sign (positive or negative)
of the expression <m>\frac{\pm1}{x\sqrt{x^2-1}}</m>. If they are both in
play it is hard to control the sign. So to simplify things we just
declare, by fiat, that the <m>x</m> in the denominator will be positive.
Specifically, we<rsq/>ll replace the <m>x</m> in the denominator with
<m>\abs{x}</m>. Now we can control the sign of the derivative of the
<m>\inverse\sec(x)</m> by simply constraining its range.

<p>
Until now there has been a pattern to differentiation that we have not
remarked on. But you may have noticed that when we differentiate a
function we usually get back another function of the same type.  That
is,

<ol>
<li>
<p>
 The derivative of a polynomial is another polynomial,
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
 The derivative of a quotient of polynomials is another quotient  of polynomials,
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
 The derivative of a trigonometric function is another  trigonometric function.
</p>
</li>
</ol>

</p>
<p>

The inverse trigonometric functions break this pattern. The derivative
of an inverse trigonometric function is not another inverse
trigonometric function. Nor is it a trigonometric function, a
polynomial, or a quotient of polynomials\aside{Well, actually that<rsq/>s
  not quite true. The derivative of the inverse tangent is a
  quotient of polynomials, and a particularly simple one at that. But
  it is not an inverse trigonometric function}.
</p>
<p>

Do you suppose there is any significance to this?
</p>
<p>

The inverse trigonometric functions will not have a significant role
in our story for a while. However they will be very useful in some
topics that will come up next semester. We<rsq/>ve introduced them here
simply because it makes sense to develop all of the differentiation
rules at more or less the same time.
</p>
<p>
We now have differentiation formulas for all of the inverse
trigonometric functions. These, along with the constraints on their
ranges are given in the table below.  <alert>Memorize them!</alert> You will
need them.

<p>
Intuitively speaking, the <term>curvature</term> of a plane curve is how
quickly a curve turns. It is an important property to understand when
designing, for example, a road or a roller-coaster where the sharpness
of a curve determines the safe speed limit for that curve. Also, the
stresses imposed on the physical structure of a moving object during
any high speed maneuver are directly related to the curvature of their
paths.

<p>
One of the first people to study the notion of curvature was
<url href="https://mathshistory.st-andrews.ac.uk/Biographies/Oresme/" visual="https://mathshistory.st-andrews.ac.uk/Biographies/Oresme/">Nicole
  Oresme</url>
(1323<ndash/>1382). Oresme defined the curvature of a straight line to be
zero (no surprise), and he defined the curvature of a circle to be the
reciprocal of its radius. For example, a circle with radius <m>2</m> is
<m>\frac12</m> whereas the curvature of a circle with radius <m>1</m> is
<m>1</m>. This makes intuitive sense. A circle with a smaller radius is
<q>more curved</q> that one with a larger radius.  The radius of the
earth is so large that the curvature of say, the equator, is so close
to zero as to be completely imperceptible, at least for someone
standing on the surface.
</p>

<p>

Oresme<rsq/>s definition of curvature works just fine for circles and
straight lines but we<rsq/>d like to extend it to more general
curves. Specifically, given a curve, we<rsq/>d like to associate a number
with each point on the curve which tells us the curvature at that
point. Ideally, this should also generalize Oresme<rsq/>s results for
straight lines and circles.
</p>

<image source="images/Curvature6.png" width="50%"/>
<p>
The sketch above shows three circles in the first quadrant with
radii, <m>\frac13</m>, <m>1</m>, and <m>2</m>, respectively.  Notice that on the unit
circle, the point of tangency travels <m>\frac{\pi}{2}</m> units along the
circumference while the the red tangent line rotates through an angle
of <m>\frac{\pi}{2}</m> radians. On the circle of radius <m>2</m>, the point of
tangency travels <m>2 \times \frac{\pi}{2}</m> units to turn the tangent
line the same <m>\frac{\pi}{2}</m> radians, whereas on the circle of radius
<m>1/3</m>, the point of tangency travels <m>\frac13\times\frac{\pi}{2}</m>
units to turn the tangent line the same <m>\frac\pi2</m> radians.  This
suggests that a possible definition for <term>curvature</term> might be the
number of radians the tangent line rotates through as it travels along
the curve divided by the distance traveled along the curve while
making the turn. In other words, the curvature for a circle of radius
<m>r</m> would be
<me>
\frac{\theta \text{ radians }}{r\theta \text{ units}}=\frac{1}{r}
\text{ radians per unit. }
</me>
This seems to make intuitive sense too. A circle with a radius of
<m>0.0000001</m> meters certainly seems to be <q>more curved</q> than a circle
with radius <m>1,000,000,000</m> meters.
</p>
<p>

By the same reasoning, the curvature of a straight line would be
zero. (Why?)
</p>
<p>

This definition works fine for circles and straight lines which have
constant curvature, but what about a more general curve. What if the
curvature changes from point to point along the curve such as a long
and winding road.
</p>
<p>

Clearly we<rsq/>ll need a definition of curvature that also changes from
point to point on the curve. So it seems reasonable to consider
infinitely small changes in both the angle <m>\theta</m> and in arclength
<m>s</m>.  More precisely, we make the following definition.
</p>

<definition xml:id="DEFINITIONCurvature-1">
<title>Curvature</title>
  <!-- \label{def:curvature-1} -->
<statement>

  <p>
    Suppose the point <m>P=(x,y)</m> lies on a curve <m>C</m> as in
    the sketch below.
  </p>
    <figure  xml:id="FIGURECurvature">
      <caption>

  <image source="images/Curvature5.png" width="40%"/>
  </figure>
  <!-- \begin{wrapfigure}[20]{l}{1.3in} -->
  <!--     \vskip-5mm  \captionsetup{labelformat=empty} -->
  <!--     \centerline{\includegraphics*[height=1.3in,width=1.3in]{../Figures/Curvature5}} -->
  <!--         \label{fig:Curvature5} -->
  <!--   \end{wrapfigure} -->
  <p>
    Let <m>\theta</m> represent the angle
    formed in the figure above by the line tangent to curve
    <m>C</m> at point <m>P</m>, with some fixed line.
  </p>
  <p>
    Then the curvature is defined to be
  <men  xml:id="EQUATIONCurvatureDef">
  \kappa=\abs{\dfdx{\theta}{s}}.
<!-- \label{eq:CurvatureDef} -->
  </men>
  </p>
</statement>
  </definition>
<p>

To keep things simple we will always designate <m>\theta</m> to be the
angle the tangent line forms with a horizontal line.
</p>
<p>

It can be difficult at first to see how <xref ref="EQUATIONCurvatureDef">formula</xref>
measures curvature but think carefully for a moment about the meaning
of the expression <m>\dfdx{\theta}{s}</m>. Loosely put <q>the rate of change
of <m>\theta</m> (the angle of our curve with the horizontal) with respect
to the change of <m>s</m> (the arclength of our curve)</q> is the ratio of
how much a point moving on the curve has changed direction to how far
it has moved. The more our curve changes direction in a given distance
the more it is curved and so the more curvature it has.
</p>
<p>

Don<rsq/>t let the absolute value bars in this formula disturb you. They
are there simply because we don’t want to consider whether a curve
bends to the right or to the left (whether <m>\theta</m> is increasing or
decreasing), but just how fast it bends.
</p>
<p>

Also note, for later reference, that
<men  xml:id="EQUATIONTanEqDeriv">
  \tan(\theta)=\dfdx{y}{x}.
<!-- \label{eq:TanEqDeriv} -->
</men>
</p>
<p>

A good test of the value of a new definition is whether or not it
produces the same results that earlier, more intuitive musings
that led us to. It should be clear that with this definition, the
curvature of a straight line would still be zero. (Why?)

<title>DIGRESSION: <foreign>Hic Sunt Dracones</foreign> (Here Be Dragons)</title>
<p>
The time has come for us to begin understanding why differentials were
abandoned as a foundational concept for Calculus. We are entering
dangerous and uncharted waters but we won<rsq/>t dive into the deep part just yet. We'll
only wade in a little way.
</p>
<p>
  To indicate dangerous and  uncharted waters on their maps medieval
  mapmakers would fill in the unexplored regions of their maps with
  illustrations of dragons and
other mythological beasts. The Lennox
  Globe, in the Rare Book Division of the The New York Public Library
  (1510 CE), even has the inscription
  <foreign>Hic Sunt Dracones</foreign> (Here Be Dragons) along the eastern
  Asian coast.

  The concept of the differential of a differential, like <m>\dx^2x</m> or
  <m>\dx^2y</m>, is a mathematical dragon of sorts.
  We will proceed carefully.
</p>
<p>

  If the entire development from <xref ref="EQUATIONDiffTheta">equation</xref> to
  <xref ref="EQUATIONCurvaturePreamble">equation</xref> feels contrived, it<rsq/>s because
  it is contrived. In particular the <q>uncancelling</q> step is clearly
  a trick in the sense that nothing we did before that step seems to
  motivate the uncancelling. We just pulled it out of the air, and it
  worked. Clearly we knew that it would work, but why do you suppose
  we used a trick rather than explaining what we were doing?
</p>

<p>
  Since everything we did hinged on the observation that
  <m>\dfdxn{y}{x}{2}=\dfdx{\left(\dfdx{y}{x}\right)}{x}</m>
  (from <xref ref="EQUATIONSecondDifferentials">equation</xref> and
  <xref ref="EQUATIONCurvaturePreamble">equation</xref>) it would seem
  more natural to simply apply the Quotient Rule to
  <m>\dx{\left(\dfdx{y}{x}\right)}</m>, wouldn<rsq/>t it?
  </p>


<p>
  Let<rsq/>s try that and see what happens. First we get
  <me>
  \dx\left(\dfdx{y}{x}\right) =
  \frac{\dx{x}\textcolor{red}{\dx{(\dx{y})}}-\dx{y}\textcolor{red}{\dx{(\dx{x})}}}{(\dx{x})^2}.
  </me>
</p>

  <aside>
<title>Comment</title>
<p>
Note this very carefully:
    <me>\dx{(\dx{y})}\neq (\dx{y})^2.</me> This is because 
 <m> (\dx{y})^2</m> is the square of 
    <m>(\dx{y})</m> whereas <m>\dx{(\dx{y})}</m> is the second
      difference of <m>y</m>.
</p>
</aside>

<p>
  Next we simplify the notation a bit.  Let <m>\textcolor{red}{\dx(\dx{y})}=\dx^2{y}</m> and
  <m>\textcolor{red}{\dx(\dx{x})}=\dx^2{x}</m> so that,
  <me>
  \dx\left(\dfdx{y}{x}\right) =
  \frac{\dx{x}\dx^2{y}-\dx{y}\dx^2{x}}{(\dx{x})^2}.</me>
</p>
<p>
  
  But the expressions <m>\dx(\dx{x}) =\dx^2x</m> and <m>\dx(\dx{y}) =\dx^2y</m>
  are a problem because to get <xref ref="EQUATIONCurvaturePreamble">equation</xref>
  when we are finished we need to have <m>\dx^2x =0</m>, but <m>\dx^2y\neq0</m>,
  which seems inconsistent. Why would <m>\dx^2y</m> be something, but
  <m>\dx^2x</m> be nothing? This is very troubling.
</p>
<p>

  We have observed regularly beginning in
  <xref ref="CHAPTERdifferentials">Chapter</xref> that the concept of a
  differentials is questionable. But if differentials are problematic,
  second differentials --  differentials of differentials -- are
  even moreso, if that is possible.
</p>
<p>


  But the problem here is conceptual, not computational. That is, there is
  no computation we can do to see that the value of <m>\dx^2x</m> must be
  zero. Rather, we need to think carefully about the meanings of our
  symbols.
</p>

<p>
  <dl>
    <li>
  <title>Leibniz<rsq/> Conception</title>
  <p>
    When we use Leibniz<rsq/> differential notation we think of
    <m>\dx{y}</m> and <m>\dx{x}</m> as infinitesimal increments in the
    <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> coordinates. Specifically,
    <m>\dx{x}=x_2-x_1</m> where <m>x_2</m> and <m>x_1</m> are
    infinitely close together. This is already a difficult thing to
    accept.
  </p>

  <p>
    But if we stick with Leibniz then it must be that <m> \dx(\dx{x})
    = \dx{x_2}-\dx{x_1}</m>, right? We can write this down and we can
    read these symbols easily enough. But what they seem to mean is
    that <m>\dx(\dx{x})</m> is the infinitely small difference of two
    infinitely small differences. So does that mean that
    <m>\dx(\dx{x})</m> just another differential? Or is
    <m>\dx(\dx{x})</m> smaller than <m>\dx{x}</m>? But <m>\dx{x}</m>
    is infinitely small so how could <m>\dx(\dx{x})</m> be smaller
    than that?
  </p>
<p>
    Down that path be dragons. We won<rsq/>t go there.
</p>
  </li>
<li>
<title>Newton<rsq/>s Conception</title>
<p>
 Instead we<rsq/>ll adopt Newton's viewpoint and hope that it gives us a
  meaningful interpretation of our symbols.
</p>
<p>
  
  For Newton, time was the only variable, and time always flows
  forward at a constant rate. He thought of a variable, <m>x</m> for
  example, as moving, or flowing (<foreign>fluent</foreign>) in time and
  <m>\dot{x}</m> was the rate of flow (<foreign>fluxion</foreign>) of the
  <foreign>fluent</foreign> <m>x</m>. In the simplest example, if <m>x</m> is the
  position of a point then <m>\dot{x}</m> is its velocity.
</p>
<p>

  Newton only applied his dot notation to something that was changing
  in time; something that has a rate of change with respect to
    time. Can we apply it to time itself?
</p>
<p>

  Sure we can. Time itself is <q>changing in time</q>, isn<rsq/>t it? Time
  flows at a rate of <m>1</m> second per second, or one day per day, or one
  century per century. The units don<rsq/>t really matter. Loosely speaking
  (and mixing the Newtonian and Leibnizian viewpoints a bit), an
  increment of time now has the same magnitude as an increment of time
  later, has the same magnitude as an increment of time in the
  past. That is, every increment of <m>t</m> is the same size.  If we let
  <m>t</m> represent elapsed time then this means that the infinitesimal
  increment <m>\dx{t}</m> is constant, so the fluxion of <m>\dx{t}</m> is
  zero: <m>\dx(\dx{t})=\dx^2{t}=\dot{\dx{t}}=0</m>.  However, keep in mind
  that this is not true of a quantity that is flowing at a variable
  rate. For example, if <m>y=t^2</m> then <m>\eval{\dx{y}}{t}{1}=2\dx{t}</m>
  whereas <m>\eval{\dx{y}}{t}{2}=4\dx{t}</m>.
</p>
<p>

  This solves our problem. If <m>\dx{t}</m> is constant then by the
  Constant Rule <me>\dx^2{t}=\dx(\dx{t})=0.</me>
</p>
<p>

  Moreover we always have the option of adopting Newton<rsq/>s convention
  that the only independent variable is time so that when we
  write <m>\dfdx{y}{x}</m> we are thinking of the independent variable <m>x</m>
  as time (although we rarely say so out loud), and we are thinking of
  <m>y</m> as functionally dependent on time (represented by <m>x</m> in this
  case).  Therefore
  <md><mrow>\dx^2x=\dx(\dx{x})=0 \amp{}\amp{}\text{ and } \amp{}\amp{} \dx^2y=\dx(\dx{y})\neq0.</mrow></md>
</p>
</li>
</dl>
</p>
<p>

  As a practical matter we will rarely be interested in second order
  differentials like <m>\dx^2x</m> or <m>\dx^2y</m>. As we indicated
  in <xref ref="SECTIONHist-intr">Section</xref> the notion of a
  differential is really just an aid to computation, a convenient
  fiction. Differentials are a helpful aid but the more important and
  useful concept is the derivative.  Differentials only serve as a
  step along the way to finding derivatives.
</p>
<p>

  On the other hand, we will be very interested in second order
  derivatives: <m> \dfdx{\left(\dfdx{y}{x}\right)}{x} =
  \dfdxn{y}{x}{2} </m> because these often represent a real, physical
  quantity like force or acceleration.
</p>
<p>
  
  But now there is another difficulty that can<rsq/>t be ignored.  In order
  to make sense of the expression <m>\dx^2{x}</m> we had to abandon
  Leibniz<rsq/> conception altogether. It is nice that Newton's viewpoint
  gives us a way to make sense of the notation but what this tells us
  is that taking either viewpoint (Newton<rsq/>s or Leibniz') does not get
  us to the logical heart of the matter. A viewpoint is just a manner
  of thinking. We adopt a viewpoint in order to build intuition.
</p>
<p>

  When two viewpoints are at odds it means that we need something
  deeper and more general. In this case we need a theory that
  subsumes, and can replace, the views of both Leibniz and Newton.
  This issue must, eventually, be addressed. But for now we will
  continue to work intuitively.  When we are done, when we stand at
  the top of the Calculus mountain we will be able to see the paths
  that Newton and Leibniz each took to get to the top.  We will begin
  our own trek to the summit in <xref
  ref="CHAPTERWhatsWrong">Chapter</xref>.

Since the equation of a straight line is <m>y=mx+b</m> it is clear
that <xref ref="EQUATIONCurvatureDef2">formula</xref> recovers
Oresmer<rsq/>s assertion that the curvature of a straight line must
be zero. (Why?)
</p>

<example>
<p>
  Let<rsq/>s apply <xref ref="EQUATIONCurvatureDef2">formula</xref> to a circle to see if
  this agrees with Oresme<rsq/>s definition of the curvature of a circle.
  Consider the circle of radius <m>r</m> given by the graph of
  <m>x^2+y^2=r^2</m>.
  Differentiate to obtain <m>  2x\dx{x}+2y\dx{y}=0</m> so that
  <me>
  \displaystyle \dfdx{y}{x}=-\frac{x}{y}.
  </me>
  Differentiate both sides again to see that
  <me>
  \dx\left(\hskip-2pt\dfdx{y}{x}\right)=\frac{-y\dx{x}+x\dx{y}}{y^2}
</me>
  or, after dividing both sides by <m>\dx{x}</m>
  <me>
  \dfdxn{y}{x}{2}=\frac{-y+x\dfdx{y}{x}}{y^2}.
  </me>
</p>

We observed earlier that if we define curvature using
<xref ref="EQUATIONCurvatureDef">equation</xref> then the curvature of a straight line
will be zero as Oresme said it should be. The converse is also
true. Specifically, if <m>\abs{\dfdx{\theta}{s}}=\kappa=0</m> then <m>\theta</m>
must be a constant and so <m>\dfdx{y}{x}=\tan(\theta)</m> must also be a
constant. (For simplicity we<rsq/>ll ignore the case where
<m>\theta=\pm\frac{\pi}{2}</m>.)

<p>
Circles and lines are the only curves in the plane with constant
curvature. But there are many different kinds of curves in
three-dimensional space with constant curvature.
</p>
</aside>

<p>
We<rsq/>ve also shown that the curvature of a circle is also constant.
Specifically, it is the reciprocal of the circle<rsq/>s radius. The
converse of this is also true. This can be shown in much the same
manner as the straight line (see <xref
ref="EQUATIONTanEqDeriv">equation</xref>) but, naturally, the
computations are more complex.
