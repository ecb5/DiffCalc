<p>
In <xref ref="SUBSECunderl-deriv">Section</xref> we saw that those points where
the derivative doesn't exist are possible optimal points but we didn't
pursue this any further at the time. However we now need to re-examine
the non-existence of derivatives.
</p>
<p>

We also observed in <xref ref="SUBSECunderl-deriv">Section</xref> that derivatives
fail to exist at points where the Principle of Local Linearity does
not hold. This is true, but the only way we currently have to
determine if the Principle of Local Linearity holds is to look at a
graph. While graphs are useful, we have learned that we should not put
all of our faith in what we  conclude from them.
</p>
<p>

On the other hand, by <xref ref="DEFDerivative">Definition~\</xref> the derivative
of a function is given by a limit, and from our work in
<xref ref="CHAlimits-lhop-rule">Chapter</xref> we know that not all limits
exist. For example, if we try to compute the value of <m>f^\prime(2)</m>
for some function and we find that
<m>\tlimit{h}{0}{\frac{f(2+h)-f(2)}{h}}</m> is meaningless then <m>f</m> is not
differentiable at <m>x=2</m>. In other words, <m>f^\prime(2)</m> does not exist.
</p>
<p>

So, the limit definition gives us a computational tool we can use to
decide the question of differentiability which, as we saw in
<xref ref="SUBSECoptim-abstr-probl">Chapter</xref>, is crucial to finding possible
optimal transition points of a function.
</p>
<p>

In our comments following
<xref ref="EXAMPLEPOTP-WhereDerivIsUndef">Example~\</xref> we listed several
functions which are not differentiable at <m>x=0</m>. Of these, the
Absolute Value function, <m>f(x)=\abs{x}</m>, is probably the simplest to
work with, so we will start there.
</p>


<example xml:id="EXAMPLEAbsValFunc">
<title>The  Absolute Value Function</title>
<p>
  The Absolute Value function is usually introduced with some vague
  statement like, 
  \centerline{<q>The absolute value of a number is just the
    positive version of the number,</q>}
  or 
  \centerline{<q><m>\abs{x-a}</m> gives the length
  of the line segment between <m>x</m> and <m>a</m>.</q>}

These are both true statements and are OK as intuitive definitions,
but we will need something more precise from now on. The formal
definition of the Absolute Value function is:

\begin{mydefinition}[The Absolute Value Function]
  The Absolute Value of <m>x</m> is: <m>\abs{x}=
  \begin{cases}
    x\amp\text{ if } x\ge0
    -x\amp\text{ if } x\lt 0
  \end{cases}</m>.
\end{mydefinition}

  \begin{wrapfigure}[10]{r}{2in}
    \vskip-3mm 
    \captionsetup{labelformat=empty}
    \centerline{\includegraphics*[height=1.5in,width=2in]{../Figures/AbsVal}}
    \label{fig:AbsVal}
  \end{wrapfigure}
  The graph of the Absolute Value function is given at the right.
  Notice that <m>f(x)=\abs{x}</m> is defined at <m>x=0</m> since <m>\abs{0}=0</m>,
  but as we indicated in <xref ref="SECTIONunderl-deriv">~</xref> the
  Principle of Local Linearity does not hold at <m>x=0</m> so we suspect
  that the Absolute Value function is not differentiable at <m>x=0</m>.
  
  But we now have the ability to confirm our suspicion analytically so let's take a look at this
  using the limit definition of the derivative. The derivative of
  <m>\abs{x}</m> at <m>x</m> will be the value of the limit
  <m>\tlimit{h}{0}{\frac{\abs{x+h}-\abs{x}}{h}}</m> so the derivative of
  <m>\abs{x}</m> at <m>x=0</m> will be:
  <me>
  \limit{h}{0}{\frac{\abs{0+h}-\abs{0}}{h}}=
  \limit{h}{0}{\frac{\abs{h}}{h}}.
  </me>
  OK, but what is this limit? Don't jump to conclusions. Think about
  this carefully for a few minutes. What do you think
  <m>\tlimit{h}{0}{\frac{\abs{h}}{h}}</m> is equal to?
    
  First suppose that <m>h</m> is approaching\aside{To say that <m>h</m> is
    <q>approaching</q> <m>0</m> suggests that <m>h</m> is sliding along the
    horizontal axis toward the origin. We encourage you to think of
    limits this way. It is a good intuitive approach. However, as we
    will see in <xref ref="CHAPTERcha:formal-limits">~</xref> it isn't quite what is
    really happening.} zero from the positive side. Recall that in
    <xref ref="SECTIONvertical-asymptotes">~</xref> we invented the notation
    <m>\rlimit{h}{0} </m> for exactly this
    situation. In this case <m>h</m> is positive so <m>\abs{h}=h</m> and
  <me>
  \rlimit{h}{0}{\frac{\abs{h}}{h}}=\rlimit{h}{0}{\frac{h}{h}}=\rlimit{h}{0}{1}=1
  </me>
  which says that the right-hand limit will be one.  Now suppose <m>h</m>
  is very small and negative. In this case <m>h</m> is negative so <m>\abs{h}=-h</m> and
  <me>
  \llimit{h}{0}{\frac{\abs{h}}{h}}=\llimit{h}{0}{\frac{-h}{h}}=\llimit{h}{0}{-1}=-1</me>
  which says that the left-hand limit will be negative one.
  
  But since <m>\frac{\abs{h}}{h}</m> can't be close to <m>1</m> and close to  <m>-1</m>
  simultaneously we can not find a value for
  <m>
  \tlimit{h}{0}{\frac{\abs{0+h}-\abs{0}}{h}}</m> which is
  correct for both positive and negative values of <m>h</m>. In other words
  this limit does not exist.

  Therefore
  <m>\eval{\dfdx{\abs{x}}{x}}{x}{0}</m> does not exist.

\begin{ProficiencyDrill}
  According to <xref ref="DEFINITIONdef:OptimalTransitionPoints">~</xref>, since
  <m>\dfdxat{(\abs{x})}{x}{0}</m> does not exist, the value <m>x=0</m> is a possible
  transition point for the Absolute Value function. So there might be
  a local extremum of <m>f(x)=\abs{x}</m> at <m>x=0</m>.  Is there?
\end{ProficiencyDrill}

 <example>
<p>
   A slightly less intuitive example is the function <m>f(x)=\frac{x}{x}</m>. It 
      is tempting to claim that this is really just <m>f(x)=1</m> since
      <q>anything divided by itself is one</q> but that claim is not true. As
      we saw in <xref ref="DIGRESSIONDivideByZero">Digression</xref> division by
      zero is undefined, regardless of the numerator. So the expression
      <m>\frac00</m> is undefined, and  therefore the function
      <m>f(x)=\frac{x}{x}</m> is not defined at <m>x=0</m>.
      
      It is also tempting to try to invoke \lhop 's Rule, since it is
      true that 
      <me>
      \limit{x}{0}{f(x)}= \limit{x}{0}{\frac{x}{x}} = \limit{x}{0}{1}=1.
      </me>
      But this only says that the limit of <m>f(x)</m> is equal to one, not
      that <m>f(x)</m> itself is equal to one, at <m>x=0</m>. The statement
      <m>\limit{x}{0}{\frac{x}{x}} = \limit{x}{0}{1}</m> explicitly
      excludes the point <m>x=0</m> from consideration. This is why when we
      discussed indeterminate forms in
      <xref ref="SECmore-indet-forms">Section</xref> we were very careful to write
      <m>\frac{\approach{0}}{\approach{0}}</m> instead of <m>\frac00</m>. We
      needed to emphasize that we specifically do not allow the
      denominator to be equal to zero.

      It is intuitively clear that derivative of the function
      <m> f(x)=\sqrt{\abs{x}}</m> (at the right) is not
      defined at <m>x=0</m>.  We will confirm our intuition using

      derivative of <m>f(x)</m> at <m>x=0</m> using <xref ref="DEFINITIONdef:Derivative"></xref>
      and see what goes wrong.

      The existence of the derivative of <m>f(x)</m> at <m>x=0</m> is equivalent to
      the existence of  the limit <m> \tlimit{h}{0}{\frac{f(0+h)-f(0)}{h}}</m>,
      so we will try to compute this limit and see what happens.

      neither of these limits even exists it
      follows that <m>\tlimit{h}{0}{\frac{\sqrt{\abs{h}}}{h}}</m> also does not
      exist,
            and therefore <m>f^\prime(0)</m> is not defined\aside{As a verbal shorthand
        most people will just say that the right- and left-hand limits are
        not equal and so <m>f^\prime(0)</m> does not exist. Be sure you
        understand why this is, strictly speaking, incorrect.}.

    In <xref ref="SECoptim-clos-interv">Section</xref> we found that the possible
    transition points come in three <q>flavors:</q> (1) points where the
    derivative is zero, (2) points where the derivative is undefined,
    and, (3) if the function is defined on a closed interval, the
    endpoints of the interval. We remarked at the time that it seemed odd
    that the third condition does not involve the derivative while the
    other two do.
</p>
<p>

    With our new, deeper understanding of differentiation we can show
    that, in fact, there are really only two kinds of possible transition
    points, and both can be identified using the derivative. It turns out
    that the endpoints of an interval are really just points of
    non-differentiability.
</p>
<p>

    To see this consider any function, <m>f(x)</m> which is continuous on the
    closed interval <m>[a,b]</m> and differentiable on the open interval
    <m>(a,b)</m>. From <xref ref="COROLLARYDeriv=LRDeriv">Corollary~\</xref> we know that
    <m>f^\prime(b)</m> only exists if <m>\rprime{f}(b)</m> and <m>\lprime{f}(b)</m> both
    exist\aside{They also need to be equal, but that is irrelevant right
      now.}.
</p>
<p>

    But the right-hand limit at <m>b</m> doesn't exist. To see this, observe
    that <m>f</m> is only defined on <m>[a,b]</m>. Therefore when <m>h>0</m> the
    expression <m>f(b+h)</m> asks us to evaluate <m>f</m> at a point outside its
    domain, which is meaningless. Thus
    <me>
    \rprime{f}(b)=\rlimit{h}{0}{\frac{\CancelToRed{\text{meaningless}}{f(b+h)}-f(b)}{h}}
    </me> 
    does not exist. A similar argument shows that <m>\lprime{f}(a)</m> does not
    exist.
</p>
<p>

    Therefore <m>f^\prime</m> does not exist at the endpoints of a closed
    interval. As a result the possible transition points of <m>f</m> are only
    those places where the derivative is zero, or undefined, because the
    latter category includes the endpoints of closed intervals.
