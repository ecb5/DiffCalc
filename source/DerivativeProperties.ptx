<p>
Geometry has always been considered as an
  exact science, and indeed as the source of the exactness which is
  widespread among other parts of mathematics.\ .\ . But it seems that
  this feature of exactness does not reign anymore in geometry since
  the new system of infinitely small quantities has been mixed to
  it. I do not see that this system has produced anything for the
  truth and it would seem to me that it often conceals
  mistakes.

Assuming that all of the properties of limits we talked about in
<xref ref="SEClimit-theorems-laws">Section</xref> can be proved, we have seen that
all of the differentiation rules we developed intuitively using
differentials in <xref ref="CHAPTdifferentials">Chapter</xref> can be made
rigorous using limits.
</p>
<p>

The question we need to address now is this: Does the need for rigor,
which prompted our definition of the
<xref ref="DEFDerivative">derivative~</xref>),
get in the way of practical applications such as, say, the First
Derivative Test? We will show that such a practical result can still
be achieved while maintaining rigor. To do this, we will need a
theorem that allows us to relate instantaneous changes to finite
changes. The French name for this theorem is <q>le théorème des
accroissements finis</q> (translated literally as <q>the Theorem of
Finite Increments</q>). In English it is called the the Mean Value
Theorem. We will see how this powerful theorem can be used to
transition from theoretical to practical.

<p>
It is actually a little surprising
how much effort it takes to prove the First Derivative Test.  We
will start by proving some  preliminary results that will make it
a little easier to follow the logic behind the proof of the First
Derivative Test.
We'll begin with Fermat's Theorem (<xref ref="THMFermatsTheorem">Theorem</xref>)
which says that if <m>f</m> attains a maximum (or minimum) at <m>x=a</m> then
<m>f^\prime(a)=0.</m> More formally:
</p>

<theorem xml:id="thm:FermatsTheorem2">
<title>Fermat's Theorem</title>
<p>
  <!-- \label{thm:FermatsTheorem2} -->
  If <m>f(a)</m> is a local extremum (either a maximum or a minimum) of
  <m>f(x)</m> at <m>x=a</m>, and <m>f(x)</m> is differentiable at <m>x=a</m> then
  <m>f^\prime(a)=0</m>.
</p>
</theorem>
<p>


Recall that Fermat's Theorem does not say that if <m>f^\prime(a)=0</m> then
<m>f(a)</m> is an extremum. In fact, we know that this is not true.
Rather, it states the converse: If we know that <m>f(a)</m> is an extremum
and <m>f^\prime(a)</m> exists, then <m>f^\prime(a) =0</m>.
</p>
<p>

It is very rare that we can develop a proof of a theorem by directly
writing down the logical steps in order.  Usually the process takes a
lot of trying, backtracking, trying again, and so on much as we
described in our analogy in <xref ref="CHAproblem-solving">Chapter</xref> about
finding your way out of a forest.
</p>
<p>

Of course, in a textbook it is not practical to list all of the bad
ideas we might have just to see that they are, in fact, bad ideas. So
we will use the following \underline{  Scrapwork} construct when we
are just <q>thinking about</q> a problem. The scrapwork is not the
proof. The purpose of scrapwork is to engage our intuition and to
begin organizing our intuitive understanding so that a rigorous proof
will emerge. So, not every statement we make inside a scrapwork
construct will necessarily be fully rigorous. If you see a gap in the
logic inside a scrapwork construct watch to see how it gets filled in
the proof.

  Notice that in <xref ref="DEFDerivative">Definition</xref> the quantity
  <m>\frac{f(a+h)-f(a)}{h}</m> is the slope of a particular secant line, as
  in the sketch at the right.
</p>
<p>

  If, as shown in the sketch at the right, <m>(a,f(a))</m> is a (local)
  maximum then the slope of the secant line in our diagram,
  <m>\frac{f(a+h)-f(a)}{h}</m>, must be negative when <m>h\gt 0</m>. Since the

<proof xml:id="no-label">
<title>Proof of Fermat's Theorem</title>

<p>
  We will only prove the case when <m>f(a)</m> is a local maximum. The case
  of a local minimum is very similar.
  
  Since <m>f(a)</m> is a local maximum there is an interval containing <m>a</m>
  such that for any <m>h</m> (sufficiently small that <m>a+h</m> is also in the
  interval), <m>f(a+h)\leq f(a)</m>. Thus <m>f(a+h)-f(a)\leq0</m> as seen in the
  sketch above. If <m>h\lt0</m> then <m>\frac{f(a+h)-f(a)}{h}\geq 0</m> and so
  <me>
  f^\prime(a)=\limit{h}{0}{\frac{f(a+h)-f(a)}{h}}\ge0.\label{eq:Rolle1}
  </me>
  However if <m>h\gt0</m> then
  <me>
  f^\prime(a)=\limit{h}{0}{\frac{f(a+h)-f(a)}{h}}\le0.\label{eq:Rolle2}

The distinction between a theorem and a lemma is very slight and
rather arbitrary. Typically we call a statement\aside{Technically
  speaking, a statement is not a theorem until it has actually been
  proved. Until then it is a conjecture.} a theorem if it is important
and requires proof. We call it a lemma if it requires proof itself,
and is used to simply the proof of a theorem.  This is not a
hard-and-fast rule by any means. Sometimes we first prove a lemma as
an aid to proving a theorem, only to find that the lemma is actually
more important. However, having been originally dubbed a lemma the
result is known ever after as a lemma.  For example, in the present
instance we will be using the Extreme Value\aside{We will not be
  proving the Extreme Value Theorem in this text. Although it appears
  to be obviously true (read it again and see), it is remarkably hard
  to prove in a fully rigorous fashion. If you feel that you must see
  the proof you should change your major to mathematics and take a
  course in Real Analysis.}, and Fermat's <em>Theorems</em> to prove
what often called Rolle's <em>Lemma</em>, and then use use Rolle's
<em>Lemma</em> to prove the Mean Value <em>Theorem</em>.  Then we will use
the Mean Value <em>Theorem</em> to prove the First Derivative <em>Test</em>. It is all
very chaotic.

When Rolle's Lemma is visualized, as in the sketch at the right, it is
clear what is going on. If <m>f(a)=f(b)</m> then between the points
<m>(a,f(a))</m> and <m>(b,f(b))</m> the graph of <m>f(x)</m> will either rise to a maximum
or drop to a minimum (not shown) at some point <m>c</m>. In either case, by
Fermat's Theorem, the derivative of <m>f</m> at <m>c</m> will be zero. Notice
that the slope of the line through <m>(a,f(a))</m> and <m>(b,f(b))</m> is also
zero. Thus these two lines are parallel.

Despite the clarity of our sketch, an analytic proof is still
required because our sketch does not capture all of the possible ways
that Rolle's Lemma  can manifest. This is demonstrated in

<title>Proof of Roll<rsq/>s Lemma</title>
<p>
  By The Extreme Value Theorem (<xref ref="THMmax-min">Theorem</xref>) there is are points 
  <m>\alpha</m> and <m>\beta</m> in the interval <m>[a,b]</m>, such that  <m>f(\alpha)</m> is a global
  maximum, and  <m>f(\beta)</m> is a global minimum.
  
  There are two possibilities for <m>\alpha</m> and <m>\beta</m>:
         \begin{enumerate}%[label={  (\alph*)}] 
  \item {  \boldmath Both <m>\alpha</m> and <m>\beta</m> are endpoints of the
      interval}: In this case since <m>f(a)=f(b)</m> the global maximum
    and the global minimum are equal. The only way that can happen is
    if the function is constant on the interval <m>[a,b]</m>, and if <m>f</m> is
    constant then <m>f^\prime(x)=0</m> for every <m>x</m> in the interval
    <m>(a,b)</m>. So we take
    <m>c</m> to be any point in <m>(a,b)</m>.

    either <m>f^\prime(\alpha)=0</m>, or <m>f^\prime(\beta)=0</m>. So we take
    <m>c=\alpha</m> or <m>c=\beta</m> as appropriate.

<p>

As we mentioned at the beginning of this chapter in French the Mean
Value Theorem is known as the <foreign>théorème des accroissements
  finis</foreign> or literally the <q>theorem of the finite increments.</q>
</p>
<p>

To see why this is an accurate description let <m>y=f(x)</m>. Then
<m>f(b)-f(a) = \Delta y</m> and <m>b-a=\Delta x</m>. So we can re-express
<xref ref="EQMVT">Equation~</xref>) as <m>\Delta y=f^\prime(c)\Delta x</m>. In this
form it is clear that the Mean Value Theorem relates the finite
increments <m>\Delta y</m> and <m>\Delta x</m> to the instantaneous rate of
change <m>f^\prime(c)</m>.
</p>
<p>

The English name, <q>Mean Value Theorem</q> comes from interpreting the
derivative as an instantaneous velocity. If <m>t</m> represents time and
<m>p(t)</m> represents position at time <m>t</m>, then <m>\frac{p(b)-p(a)}{b-a}</m>
is the average velocity in the time interval <m>[a,b]</m>. Since
<m>p^\prime(c)</m> is instantaneous velocity at time <m>c</m>, the conclusion of
the Mean Value Theorem is that at some point in that interval,
instantaneous velocity must match average (mean) velocity. For
example, if you travel <m>50</m> miles in one hour then your average
velocity is <m>50\frac{\text{miles}}{\text{hour}}</m>. But it is unlikely
that you traveled at exactly <m>50\frac{\text{miles}}{\text{hour}}</m> for
the entire hour. However, at one instant (possibly more) you had to have
been traveling at exactly <m>50\frac{\text{miles}}{\text{hour}}</m>. This
is the Mean Value Theorem. It provides the bridge we need to get from
infinitesimals to finite intervals.

<p>
  We want to use the Mean Value Theorem  on the interval <m>[a,b]</m> so we begin by

  satisfied on that interval.  
  Observe that <m>[a,b]</m> is a subinterval of <m>[\alpha,\beta]</m> so <m>f(x)</m>
  is continuous on <m>[a,b]</m> and differentiable on <m>(a,b)</m>.

  \begin{align*}
    \frac{f(b)-f(a)}{b-a} \amp= f^\prime(c)
    f(b)-f(a) \amp= f^\prime(c)(b-a).
  \end{align*}
  Since both  <m>b-a\gt 0</m> and <m>f^\prime(c)\gt 0</m> are

<p>
While we are in this frame of mind, we'll take a moment to notice that
we can use the Mean Value Theorem  to prove, rigorously, something that we have
alluded to a few times but have never addressed directly.  It is clear
from our differentiation rules that if two functions differ by a
constant, then they have the same derivative.  We've mentioned that
the converse is true, namely if two functions have the same derivative
on an interval then they must differ by a constant. %  For example, see
This can be proved in a
manner similar to the proof above.

We did not prove  \lhop 's Rule
(<xref ref="THMLHRuleGen">Theorem</xref>) in <xref ref="CHAlimits-lhop-rule">Chapter</xref>
because the general theorem is slightly beyond the scope of this
text. But the somewhat simpler first special case,
<xref ref="THMLHRule1">Theorem</xref>, is a straightforward consequence of  the
Mean Value Theorem.
