      <p>
        You are already familiar with fourteen of the so-called elementary
        functions in mathematics. These are:

        <dl>
          <li>
              <title>Polynomials:</title> 
            <p>
              Polynomials are functions of the
              form: <m>f(x) = c_0+c_1x+c_2x^2+c_3x^3+\ldots+c_{n-1}x^{n-1}+c_nx^n,</m>
              where <m>c_0, \ldots, c_n</m> are constants.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
              <title>Rational Functions:</title>
            <p>
              The rational functions
              are quotients of polynomials:
              <me>
                \frac{a_0+a_1x+a_2x^2+a_3x^3+\ldots+a_{n-1}x^{n-1}+a_nx^n}{b_0+b_1x+b_2x^2+b_3x^3+\ldots+b_{n-1}x^{m-1}+b_mx^m},
              </me>
              where <m>a_1, \ldots, a_n, b_1, \ldots, b_m</m> are constants.
            </p>
          </li>
          
          <li>
              <title>Trigonometric Functions:</title>
            <p>
              There are six trigonometric functions:
              <m>\sin(\theta)</m>, <m>\cos(\theta)</m>,
              <m>\tan(\theta)</m>, <m>\cot(\theta)</m>,
              <m>\sec(\theta)</m>, and <m>\csc(\theta).</m>
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <title>Trigonometric Inverses:</title>
            <p>
              Each of the trigonometric functions has an associated
              inverse: <m>\inverse\sin(\theta)</m>, <m>
              \inverse\cos(\theta)</m>, <m>\inverse\tan(\theta)</m>,
              <m> \inverse\cot(\theta)</m>,
              <m>\inverse\sec(\theta)</m>, and
              <m>\inverse\csc(\theta).</m>
            </p>
          </li>
        </dl>

        Algebraically combining this basic set of fourteen functions allows us
        to build almost all of the functions you have encountered so far in
        your mathematics education. Loosely speaking what makes these
        elementary is that we don<rsq/>t need Calculus to define them.
      </p>
      <p>

        But Calculus gives us several different ways to define a multitude of
        new functions. Each such function is a new tool. New tools give us the
        means to solve new problems, and a new way to approach old
        problems. This is one reason that the invention of Calculus was such
        an important advance.
      </p>

      <p>
        Functions which require Calculus for their definition are (usually)
        called <term>analytic</term> functions.
      </p>
      <aside>
        <title>Mathematical Terminology</title>
        <p>
          The precise definition of <term>analytic</term> actually
          comes directly from the work we did in <xref
          ref="SECTIONmore-high-deriv">Section</xref> on approximating
          functions with polynomials. But one way or another the
          definition of <term>analytic</term> is tied to Calculus.
        </p>
        <p>
          The exponential and logarithmic functions which we take up
          next occupy a middle ground between the elementary and the
          analytic functions. They can be defined without Calculus,
          which is why you<rsq/>re probably already familiar with them. But
          in some ways it is better to use Calculus.  The exponential
          functions give us our first, fairly easy-to-understand
          introduction to the construction of new functions using
          Calculus so we will start there.

    <section xml:id="SECTIONIvps">
      <title>Initial Value Problems (IVPs)</title>
      <p>
        Let<rsq/>s step back for a moment.  Recall  the definition of an Initial Value Problem from <xref ref="DEFINITIONIVP"></xref>.  An IVP consists of two parts:

        <ol>
          <li>
            <p>
              The differential equation (for example, <m>\dfdx{y}{x}=2x</m>),
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              The initial value. (So called because when the
              independent variable is time  we usually know the value of our
              function initially.)
            </p>
          </li>
        </ol>
      </p>

      <p>
        A common way to create new functions using Calculus is by
        defining the new function to be the solution(s) of a specified
        IVP.
      </p>

      <example>
<idx><h>Differential Equations</h><h>defining functions via</h></idx>
        <p>  We<rsq/>ve seen that when we differentiate the formula <m>y=x^2</m> we get the
        <term>differential equation</term> <m>\dx{y} = 2x\dx{x},</m> or
        <men  xml:id="EQUATIONx2diffeq">
          \dfdx{y}{x}=2x.
<!-- \label{eq:x2diffeq} -->
        </men>
        If we did not already know that the function <m>y(x)=x^2</m> satisfies
        <xref ref="EQUATIONx2diffeq">equation</xref> we could give a name to the solution
        (sqr<m>(x)</m>, perhaps?) and by fiat, define sqr<m>(x)</m> to be
        whatever function solves this equation.
        But there is a problem. The solution of <xref ref="EQUATIONx2diffeq">equation</xref>
        is a multifunction, remember? To choose a single branch we need to
        impose an initial condition.
        </p>
      </example>

      <exercise xml:id="DRILLIVP-sqr">
          <p>
            Solve each of the following IVPs. Graph your solutions:
            <ol cols="2" marker="i">
              <li>
                <p>
                  <m>\dfdx{y}{x}=2x,\ \ \ y(0)=0</m>
                </p>
              </li>
            <li>
            <p>
              <m>\dfdx{y}{x}=2x,\ \ \ y(0)=1</m>

        <li>

            <p>
              <m>\dfdx{y}{x}=2x,\ \ \ y(1)=2</m>
            </p>
          </li>
        <li>
            <p>
              <m>\dfdx{y}{x}=2x,\ \ \ y(-1)=1</m>
            </p>
          </li>
        <li>
            <p>
              <m>\dfdx{y}{x}=x,\ \ \ y(0)=1</m>
            </p>
          </li>
        <li>
            <p>
              <m>\dfdx{y}{x}=2x,\ \ \ y(x_0)=y_0</m> where <m>x_0</m> and <m>y_0</m> are
              fixed, but unspecified constants.
            </p>
        </li>
            </ol>
          </p>
      </exercise>
<p>
        Simply naming the function tells us nothing about it. However the IVP
        itself can give us a some insight into the nature of the solution.
        For example since <m>2x\lt 0</m> when <m>x\lt 0</m>, the slope of the graph of
        <m>y(x)</m> is clearly also negative when <m>x\lt 0</m>, Similarly, the slope
        of the graph of <m>y(x)</m> is positive when <m>x\gt 0</m>.
      </p>
      <p>

        Of course we already knew that since we have a formula for
        <m>y(x)=\text{sqr}(x)=x^2</m>. This won<rsq/>t be true in the next section.

<p>
      In exactly the same way that we can define <m>\text{sqr}(x)</m> via any of
      the
      Initial Value Problems in <xref ref="DRILLIVP-sqr"></xref> we can declare, by fiat, the following:

          <m>\exp(x)</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </definition>

    <p>
      But of course as we said earlier, simply giving the function a name
      does not tell us anything about it.
    </p>

    <p>
      In <xref ref="SECTIONEulersMethod">Section</xref>
      we investigated this IVP in some detail and we were able to draw an
      approximate graph of the natural exponential (at least near the
      initial value, <m>\exp(0)</m>). We will explore this function further here.
    </p>


    
    <p>
      Recall that the Taylor Polynomial of a function, as described in
      <xref ref="SECTIONmore-high-deriv"></xref>, <xref ref="EQUATIONTaylorFormula">equation</xref>,
      given by
      <me>
        T_n(x)=y(0) +\frac{y^{\prime}(0)}{1!}x
        +\frac{y^{(2)}(0)}{2!}x^2+\frac{y^{(3)}(0)}{3!}x^3
        + \cdots +
        \frac{y^{(n)}(0)}{n!}x^n,
      </me>
      can approximate the function <m>y(x)</m> well, near a given point. Since we
      know the value of the natural exponential at the initial
      value letâ€™s try to generate the Taylor Polynomial approximation of
      <m>\exp(x)</m> near that point.
    </p>

    <aside>

<p>
Recall that the parenthetical superscript, <m>(n)</m>, indicates the
<m>n</m>th derivative. Thus <m>y^{(2)}(x)</m> represents the second

        But how? Nothing really presents itself as a potential solution so
        what should we do?  Since we don<rsq/>t seem to have any better options,
        let<rsq/>s see if we can guess a solution.
      </p>

    <paragraphs  xml:id="DIGRESSIONGuessingEffectively">
      <title>DIGRESSION: The Art of Guessing Effectively</title>
<idx><h>Digression</h><h>The Art of Guessing Effectively</h></idx>

      <p>
        No, really.  Guessing can be surprisingly effective.
      </p>
      <p>

        You know this of course. You<rsq/>ve been doing it all of your life, but
        in the past <mdash/> especially in math classes <mdash/> guessing was probably
        discouraged so you tend to deny doing it, possibly even to yourself.
        It<rsq/>s OK. Guess anyway. We won<rsq/>t tell anyone.
      </p>

      <p>
        The fact is that guessing is a tried and true solution technique and
        we encourage you to use it regularly.  Guessing is nothing more, or
        less, than relying on your native intuition.
      </p>

      <p>
        Effective guessing is a skill. You need practice to do it
        well and, unfortunately, you have probably not had much chance to
        practice that skill in the context of mathematics.  So we encourage
        you to guess often from now on. But be aware that making a guess is
        a process, not an event. If you guess wrong, which
        is most likely, then you have a new, related problem to think
        about: All of your intuition said this was a good guess.  Why didn<rsq/>t
        it work?  The answer to that question almost always gives some
        insight into the original problem.  Even a bad guess can be useful.
      </p>

      <p>
        However a bad guess, indeed
        any guess,  in isolation is a waste of time. You must also take
        the time to figure out why your bad guess doesn<rsq/>t work.
      </p>

      <p>
        But the real danger in guessing <mdash/> the reason it is usually
        discouraged <mdash/> is that when you do guess correctly, or nearly so, it
        is  very tempting to just move on from there. Don<rsq/>t do that.
      </p>

      <p>
        Guessing correctly means that your intuition was very good. But
        intuition is unconscious.  It is at least as important to understand
        where a good guess came from, and why it worked as it is to
        understand why a bad guess didn<rsq/>t work.  But when you guess well it
        is extremely tempting to just take your good guess and run with
        it. This will invariably lead to confusion later. So, when you guess
        correctly take a few moments to think about the intuition that led
        you to that guess.  Bring that intuition out of your unconscious
        mind and into your conscious mind.  If you don<rsq/>t do that your
        guesses are a waste of your time. 
      </p>

      <p>
        So let<rsq/>s take a guess. There is no need to get really crazy about it
        though. We already know that the Taylor polynomial of <m>\exp(x)</m>
        approximates <m>\exp(x)</m>. Maybe we can find an <m>n</m> large enough that the
        approximation becomes exact.

            <p>
              Notice that if
              <me>y= 1+x+\frac{x^2}{2!}+\frac{x^3}{3!} + \ldots +
              \frac{x^{999999}}{999999!} +   \frac{x^{1000000}}{1000000!}
              </me>
              then
              <me>
                \dfdx{y}{x} = 1+x+\frac{x^2}{2!}+\frac{x^3}{3!} + \ldots +
                \frac{x^{999999}}{999999!},
              </me>
              so that the difference between <m>y</m> and <m>\dfdx{y}{x}</m> is
              <me>
                y-\dfdx{y}{x} = \frac{x^{1000000}}{1000000!}.
              </me>
            </p>

            <p>
              Since the difference between <m>y</m> and <m>\dfdx{y}{x}</m> is that stupid
              one-millionth term <mdash/> which is very small <mdash/>  it is clear that we<rsq/>ve
              almost got something here. Surely we can handle that last term somehow!
            </p>

            <p>
              Sadly no, we can<rsq/>t. In fact no polynomial will solve
              <xref ref="IVPExpDiffeq">IVP</xref>.
            </p>


            <problem>
              <statement>
                <p>
                  Show that the previous paragraph is true. That is, show that there
                  is no (non-zero) polynomial that solves the differential equation:
                  <m>\dfdx{y}{x}=y.</m>

              </statement>
<hint>
<p>
Consider the degree of the polynomial and the
                  degree of its derivative.

</p>
</hint>
            </problem>

            <p>
              Since no polynomial will work a fair question is: Why have we taken
              you on this wild goose chase?
            </p>

            <p>
              In fact, we almost have a solution here. One million is a very
              large number, so one million factorial (<m>1000000!</m> is inconceivably
              large. Thus for any value of <m>x</m> we<rsq/>re likely to encounter that one
              millionth term, <m>\frac{x^{1000000}}{1000000!},</m> is so incredibly close
              to zero that it almost isn<rsq/>t really there. And if it isn<rsq/>t really
              there then
              <me>
                y= 1+x+\frac{x^2}{2!}+\frac{x^3}{3!} + \ldots +
                \frac{x^{999999}}{999999!}  \textcolor{red}{\underbrace{+
                \frac{x^{1000000}}{1000000!}}_{ \text{Not really
                here. Shhh!}}}
              </me>
              and its derivative
              <me>
                \dfdx{y}{x}= 1+x+\frac{x^2}{2!}+\frac{x^3}{3!} + \ldots +
                \frac{x^{999999}}{999999!}
              </me>
              are pretty much the same thing.
            </p>

            <p>
              So we<rsq/>re . . . done, . . . right?
            </p>

            <p>
              No, of course not. Although that last term really is
              practically zero it is not actually zero, no matter how
              small it is.  As Newton said, <q>In mathematics the
              smallest of errors must be dealt with.</q>
              </p>
              <aside>
<title>Historical Background</title>
<p>
Newton wrote his
              scientific works in Latin. This is a very loose translation of the
              phrase <foreign>In rebus mathematicis erores quam minimi non sunt
              contemnendi.</foreign> from his book <pubtitle> Quadraturam Curvarum</pubtitle> (On
              the Quadrature of Curves).
</p>
</aside>


            <p>
              So we haven<rsq/>t solved our problem in the sense of having an explicit
              formula for <m>\exp(x)</m>. But we do know a great deal about it at this
              point. In particular we know that the Taylor polynomial
              <m> 1+x+\frac{x^2}{2!}+\frac{x^3}{3!} + \ldots +
              \frac{x^{999999}}{999999!} + \frac{x^{1000000}}{1000000!}</m> will be a
              very good approximation of <m>\exp(x)</m>, at least for  values
              of <m>x</m> near zero.
            </p>

            <p>
              But if there is no polynomial that solves
              <xref ref="IVPExpDiffeq">equation</xref> does that mean there is no solution at
              all? Certainly not. In fact, since that last term of the polynomial
              seems to be the stumbling block the solution is clear: All we need to
              do is not have a last term.
            </p>

            <p>
              This is a startling idea but before we dismiss it, let<rsq/>s take our own
              advice from <xref ref="DIGRESSIONGuessingEffectively" text="custom">Digression: The Art of Guessing Effectively</xref>. We<rsq/>ll trust
              our intuition, but also examine it closely. What we<rsq/>re saying is that
              the solution of <xref ref="IVPExpDiffeq">equation</xref> is:
              <men  xml:id="EQUATIONExpSeries1">
                y= 1+x+\frac{x^2}{2!}+\frac{x^3}{3!} + \cdots
                <!-- \label{eq:ExpSeries1} -->
              </men>
              where the dots at the end mean that the summation goes on
              forever. There is no last term.
            </p>
      
            <p>
              You would expect a polynomial that doesn<rsq/>t end to be called an
              infinite polynomial but it is not. Such an expression is called an
              <term>infinite series.</term> Usually we  just call it a series. A
              series is not a polynomial. That is, a polynomial is
              defined to have only finitely many terms and a series is
              defined to have infinitely many terms. We distinguish them from
              each other
              specifically so that we don<rsq/>t confuse a series with a polynomial.
            </p>
      
            <p>
              An obvious question to ask is, <q>Does this infinite series even mean
              anything?</q> Or, equivalently, <q>What does it mean to add up infinitely
              many numbers?</q>  These are excellent questions which will have to be
              addressed eventually. But for now we won<rsq/>t let them trouble us. We<rsq/>ll
              just assume that <m>y=1+x+\frac{x^2}{2!}+\frac{x^3}{3!}+\ldots</m> makes
              sense, in the same way we assumed that differentials make sense and
              defer those questions until later.

              We would be remiss if we did not mention that we have lead you
              up to the edge of an abyss here. It is not at all clear that the
              Sum Rule for differentiation can be extended to infinite sums in
              any meaningful manner. In fact, this is a very delicate
              question. Sometimes the extension is valid and sometimes it is
              not. This is another of the foundational questions (like <q>What
              is a differential?</q>) that took mathematicians nearly <m>200</m>
              years to resolve and understanding that resolution requires the
              use of considerably more subtle tools than we have at this
              point. You will learn more about this in the next course. For
              now we will assert the prerogative of the teacher and simply
              tell you that in this case term-by-term differentiation still
              works.

              The result of <xref ref="PROBLEMTaylorSeries1"></xref>
              seems to show that we have the exact solution of <xref
              ref="IVPExpDiffeq">IVP</xref> in the form of the
              infinite series,
              <men  xml:id="EQUATIONExpSeries2">
                \exp(x)=1+x+\frac{x^2}{2!}+\frac{x^3}{3!}+\frac{x^4}{4!}+\ldots.
              </men>
              This actually is a correct solution of <xref ref="IVPExpDiffeq">IVP</xref>, and
              eventually you will learn to work with infinite series solutions of
              IVPs directly. But, unfortunately, we don<rsq/>t yet have the tools that allow
              us to do that. So we will have to find another way.
              What now?

              The sketch above shows the graph of the polynomial
              <m>y= 1+x+\frac{x^2}{2!}+\frac{x^3}{3!}+ \cdots + \frac{x^{50}}{50!}</m>
              which we believe, from our work in <xref ref="SECTIONmore-high-deriv">Section</xref>,
              should be a good approximation to <m>\exp(x)</m>, at least when <m>x</m> is near
              zero. When we zoom in on the part of the graph which is near <m>x=0</m> we
              see that the following
              graph should be a reasonable approximation to the solution of
              <xref ref="IVPExpDiffeq">IVP</xref> in the interval shown.

            <p>
              In your earlier math courses you may have seen graphs that looked like
              this before. If not, then consider the following graphs of the
              <term>exponential functions</term>, <m>y=2^x</m> and <m>y=3^x</m>
              and notice that they are very similar to the graph of <m>y=
              1+x+\frac{x^2}{2!}+\frac{x^3}{3!}+ \cdots + \frac{x^{50}}{50!}</m>.
            </p>
            <image source="images/2^xAnd3^x.png" width="40%" />
            <p>
              This
              is much clearer  when we graph all three functions
              on the same axes as seen here:
            </p>

            <!-- \centerline{\includegraphics*[height=2in,width=2.5in]{../Figures/2^xAnd3^x}} -->
            <image source="images/Exp2and3.png" width="40%" />
            <!-- \centerline{\includegraphics*[height=2in,width=2.5in]{../Figures/Exp2and3}} -->
            <p>
              As you can plainly see near <m>x=0</m> they are indeed very similar.
            </p>
            <image source="images/Exp2and3.png" width="40%" />

            <p>
              Since the polynomial <m>y= 1+x+\frac{x^2}{2!}+\frac{x^3}{3!}+
              \cdots + \frac{x^{50}}{50!}</m> is an approximation to the
              solution of <xref ref="IVPExpDiffeq">IVP</xref> it appears that
              either of <m>y(x)=2^x</m> or <m>y(x)=3^x</m> might be a viable
              candidate for the solution of our IVP.  Is it possible we<rsq/>ve had
              the solution in our hands all along? Let<rsq/>s differentiate
              <m>y(x)=2^x</m> to see if solves <xref
              ref="IVPExpDiffeq">IVP</xref>.
            </p>

            <p>
              If <m>y(x)=2^x</m> then <m>y(0)=2^0=1</m> so the initial condition is
              satisfied.
            </p>

            <p>
              To check the differential equation it is tempting to assume that we
              can apply the Power Rule, giving us <m>\dfdx{(2^x)}{x} = x2^{x-1}</m>. But
              this can<rsq/>t possibly be correct because when <m>x</m> is negative then
              <m>x2^{x-1}</m> is also negative. But the slope of <m>y(x)=2^x</m> is positive
              everywhere as you can see from its graph.
            </p>

            <p>
              In fact, none of our differentiation rules will give us the derivative
              of <m>y=2^x.</m> So we will have to go back to basics and find
              <m>\dfdx{y}{x}</m> from first principles, without using any of our
              Differentiation Rules.

Our notation fails us a bit
              here. Recall that <m>y(x)</m> is a function so <m>y(x+\dx{x})</m> means <q><m>y</m>
              evaluated at <m>x+\dx{x}</m>.</q> This is not multiplication.

            <p>
              Let <m>y(x)=2^x</m> and observe that <m>\dx{y}</m> is the (infinitesimal)
              difference between <m>y(x+\dx{x})</m> and
              <m>y(x)</m>, or
<me>
              \dx{y} =y(x+\dx{x})-y(x)
</me>

              Since <m>y(x+\dx{x})</m> is equal to <m>2^{x+\dx{x}}</m> and <m>y(x)=2^x</m> we
              have,
<me>
              \dx{y}  =2^{x+\dx{x}}-2^x.

              We have become comfortable thinking of <m>\dx{x}</m> as infinitely small,
              but it should be clear that if we take <m>\dx{x}</m> to be a very
              small, but finite number, say <m>\dx{x}= 0.0000001,</m> we can use
              <xref ref="EQUATIONDEXP2">equation</xref> to approximate <m>\dfdx{y}{x}</m> as

              This isn<rsq/>t bad for a first try! Do you see that we have almost
              satisfied the differential equation? We have
              <m>\dfdx{(2^x)}{x}\approx (0.7)2^x</m> when what we need is
              <m>\dfdx{(2^x)}{x}=2^x</m>.  The constant factor is a bit too small. If it
              were <m>1</m> instead of <m>0.7</m> we<rsq/>d have the solution of
              <xref ref="IVPExpDiffeq">IVP</xref>. This is hopeful.

            <p>
              Performing the same calculation using <m>y(x)=3^x</m> we see that once
              again we almost have a solution:

                \dfdx{y}{x}=\dfdx{(3^x)}{x}\approx

              The initial condition is still satisfied and once again

<!-- <title>Exponential Notation</title> -->
<p> 
       We originally named this function <m>\exp(x)</m>.That is still a
        valid name for it, just as sqr(<m>x</m> is a valid name for the function
        sqr<m>(x)=x^2</m>. However, just as the formula <m>y(x)=x^2</m>
        better represents the way we usually think about the squaring
        function (<q>square the input variable</q>, the notation <m>y(x)=e^x</m>
        better represents the way we usually think about the natural
        exponential function.
</p>
<p>
        You should think of the natural exponential as <q>this funny number
        <m>e</m> raised to the power of the input variable.</q>

        However, it is a curious fact that the modern definition of the
        natural exponential is not <m>e^x.</m> The modern definition is
        actually the infinite series we derived earlier:
        <me>e^x=\exp(x)=1+x+\frac{x^2}{2!}+\frac{x^3}{3!}+ \cdots.</me>
</p>
<p>
        To see why we define it this way, ask yourself what the
        expression <m>e^{1/2}</m> means.
</p>
<p>
        That<rsq/>s easy enough. Since <m>x^{1/2}=\sqrt{x}</m> clearly
        <m>e^{1/2}</m> is the square root of this funny number
        <m>e</m>: <me>e^{1/2}=\sqrt{e}.</me> It would not necessarily be easy to compute the
        square root of <m>e</m> but we<rsq/>re only asking about the meaning of our
        symbols here. Since <m>e</m> is a positive number we can take its square
        root and that is what <m>\sqrt{e}</m> means, even if we can<rsq/>t
        compute it.  In precisely the same way <m>e^{5/7}=\sqrt[7]{e^5}</m>,
        <m>e^{2/3}=\sqrt[3]{e^2}</m> and in general if <m>a</m> and <m>b</m> are positive
        integers, <m>e^{a/b}=\sqrt[b]{e^a}</m>.
</p>
<p>
        But what could the expression <m>2^e</m> possibly mean?  Since <m>e</m> is not
        an integer it doesn<rsq/>t mean <q><m>e</m> copies of <m>2</m> multiplied
        together.</q>  Since <m>e</m> can<rsq/>t be represented as ratio of integers
        (because it is irrational after all) it doesn<rsq/>t mean some
        root of <m>2</m> raised to a power the way that say, <m>2^{5/7}</m> means
        <m>\sqrt[7]{2^5}.</m> This difficulty is compounded if we ask for the
        meaning of <m>e^\pi</m> or <m>\pi^e</m> since both <m>e</m> and <m>\pi</m> are
        irrational.
</p>
<p>
        And this is not just a matter of not knowing the value of <m>e</m>.  The
        difficulty is built into the real numbers. Recall that we saw the
        same issue come up in <xref ref="SECTIONsome-rules-diff">Section</xref> when we
        tried to extend the Power Rule to irrational exponents.
        This is weird.

Many people are repelled when they encounter this
          situation. Especially in mathematics. After all, mathematics is
          about having the answers to mathematical problems isn<rsq/>t it? 
</p>
<p>
          Well,
          no. Actually it isn<rsq/>t. You<rsq/>re thinking of engineering. 
          Mathematics is about finding the answers to mathematical
          problems, not having them.

</p>
</aside>
<p>
        Even if we can<rsq/>t compute it we need to find a way to give
        meaning
  to the expression <m>e^x</m> that works when <m>x</m> is
        irrational.  Ideally, we<rsq/>d like our interpretation to be consistent
        with our understanding that <m>e^3= e\cdot e\cdot e.</m>

        This is precisely why we define natural exponential as an infinite
        series.    It can be shown (though we will not show it here) that if <m>m</m>, and <m>n</m> are integers with
        <m>n\gt0</m>  then
        <men  xml:id="EQUATIONExpSeries4">
        \exp\left(\frac{m}{n}\right)= \left(\sqrt[n]{e}\right)^m=1+\left(\frac{m}{n}\right)+\frac{\left(\frac{m}{n}\right)^n}{n!}+\frac{\left(\frac{m}{n}\right)^3}{3!}+\frac{\left(\frac{m}{n}\right)^4}{4!}+\ldots 
<!-- \label{eq:ExpSeries4} -->
        </men>
</p>
<p>
        If there is only one solution to <xref ref="IVPExpDiffeq">IVP</xref> (there is) then
        <m>y(x) = e^x</m> and <m>y(x)=1+x+\frac{x^2}{2!}+\frac{x^3}{3!}+\ldots</m>
        must be the same solution.  Defining <m>\exp(x)</m> as
        <men  xml:id="EQUATIONExpSeries3">
          \exp(x)=1+x+\frac{x^2}{2!}+\frac{x^3}{3!}+\frac{x^4}{4!}+\ldots,
        </men>
        rather than <m>\exp(x)=e^x</m> addresses all of these issues. For example
        <m>e^\pi</m> means
        <me>
        e^\pi=
        1+\pi+\frac{\pi^2}{2!}+\frac{\pi^3}{3!}+\frac{\pi^4}{4!}+\ldots.
        </me>
</p>
<p>
        Of course we are still free to think of the natural exponential as
        <m>e^x</m>, regardless of the definition and we encourage you to do
        that. It can be very helpful.

        But the evidence is compelling that <m>\exp(x)=e^x</m> is the solution of

        You might ask, <q>Why not just figure out what <m>e</m> actually is, and use

        We now have a new differentiation rule to remember.  This one is
        particularly easy to remember: The natural exponential function
      is its own derivative, <me>\dfdx{(e^x)}{x}=e^x.</me>
      But just because we have a new rule, does not mean that our old

      <p>
        We commented in <xref ref="SECTIONbridg-chains-telesc">Section</xref> that Galileo
        believed erroneously that a chain hanging from two pegs falls
        naturally into the shape of a parabola. In
        <xref ref="PROBLEMcatenary">Problem</xref> we showed that Galileo was wrong but we
        have not
        yet addressed the question: What is the shape of a hanging chain?
      </p>
      <p>

        Recall that the hanging chain must satisfy the differential
        equation
        <me>
          \dfdxn{y}{x}{2} = \frac{w}{H}\sqrt{1+\left(\dfdx{y}{x}\right)^2}
        </me>
        where <m>w</m> is the weight density of the chain and <m>H</m> is the
        (constant) magnitude of the horizontal tension. In
        <xref ref="PROBLEMHangingChain">Problem</xref> we will see that although the
        natural exponential function <m>y=e^x</m> is not the solution itself,
        it is the key to the solution.

            The Calculus in this problem is pretty straightforward but the

        The expressions <m>\frac12\left(e^x+e^{-x}\right)</m> and
        <m>\frac12\left(e^x-e^{-x}\right)</m> arise frequently in many scientific
        and engineering problems and have been named the <term>hyberbolic
        cosine</term> and <term>hyberbolic sine</term> and are denoted <m>\cosh(x)</m>
        and  <m>\sinh(x)</m>,
        respectively. As you see these names break with the longstanding
        mathematical tradition of giving important functions three letter
        names. Why do you suppose we would do that?

        is not a coincidence. It also explains

        The many scientific and engineering problems that involve the

        Saarinen</url> wanted to build it in the shape of an inverted
        catenary.  The arch would have a height of <m>630</m> feet and a
        width of <m>630</m> feet.  Its cross sections would be equilateral
        triangles with sides <m>54</m> feet at ground level shrinking to
        <m>17</m> feet at the top.  To obtain the shape of the arch,

      <title>Exponential Growth</title>

      <example xml:id="EXAMPLEpopulation-growth">
        <title>Population Growth</title>
        <p>
          Suppose we start with a colony of <m>10</m> grams of bacteria in a Petri
          dish and we wish to model the growth of the population as a function
          of time. In order to keep our initial discussion simple we begin by
          assuming that <m>30</m>% of our bacteria divide once per day at the same
          time.  Such a population is growing at a rate of <m>30</m>% per day.  If
          we start with <m>10</m> grams of bacteria on day zero, then on day one
          we<rsq/>ll have <m>30%</m> more, or <m>13</m> grams. On day two we<rsq/>ll have <m>30\%</m>
          more than on day one, or <m>16.9</m> grams. It should be clear that the
          rate of growth from day <m>n</m> to day <m>n+1</m> is proportional to how many
          bacteria we have on day <m>n</m>. Thus from any one day to the next we
          see that the change in <m>P</m> (that is,  <m>\Delta P</m>) is given by
          <men  xml:id="EQUATIONDiscBacterModel">
                        \Delta P = 0.3 P\Delta t
          </men>
          where <m>\Delta t = 1</m> day, and <m>\Delta P</m> is the change in population
          on that day.

        </p>
        <p>

          But we assumed that <m>30</m>% of the bacteria were dividing in sync
          once per day, which is unrealistic. To get closer to reality suppose
          next that enough of them divide during any one hour so that at the
          end of one day the population has still grown by <m>30</m>%. Then from
          any one hour to the next we again have
          <xref ref="EQUATIONDiscBacterModel">equation</xref> but this time <m>\Delta t</m> is
          equal to one hour, or <m>\frac{1}{24}</m> day.  However, we don<rsq/>t have to
          measure time in days. If we measure it in hours instead we again
          have <m>\Delta t=1 \text{ hour } = \frac{1}{24} \text{ day}</m>. The constant factor is still <m>0.3</m> because we assumed that the
          population was growing at <m>30%</m> per day, and this is still
          true. That factor is called the <term>nominal</term> growth rate.
        </p>


<aside>
<title>Mathematical Terminology</title>

<p>
The word
          nominal means <q>in name or thought</q> so this is the named
          growth rate. It is not always the actual growth rate as we will
          see soon.
</p>
</aside>


        <p>
          If we measure time in seconds the same reasoning will give us
          <xref ref="EQUATIONDiscBacterModel">equation</xref>, with <m>\Delta t=1 \text{ second }
          = 1.15741\times 10^{-5} \text{ day}</m>. If we
          measure in nanoseconds we get <xref ref="EQUATIONDiscBacterModel">equation</xref>,
          with <m>\Delta t=1 \text{ nanosecond } = 1.15741\times 10^{-14} \text{ day}</m>. If we measure time in
          infinitesimal increments we  get
          <me>
            \dx{P}=0.3P\dx{t}.
          </me>
        </p>
        <p>
<idx><h>Local Linearity</h></idx>

          Notice that we are using the Principle of Local Linearity here. In this
          infinitesimal time interval the <term>nominal</term> growth rate, <m>0.3P </m>,
          is virtually constant and so we are treating it as linear
          growth.
        </p>
        <p>

          Since we started with <m>10</m> grams of
          bacteria we have the initial condition <m>P(0)=10</m>. This says that the
          amount of bacteria at time <m>t</m> must satisfy the IVP:
          <mdn>
            <mrow xml:id="EQUATIONBacteriaIVP">
            \dfdx{P}{t}= 0.3P,\amp{}\amp{} P(0)=10.
            </mrow>
          </mdn>
          Take specific notice that the differential equation in
          <xref ref="EQUATIONBacteriaIVP">IVP</xref> expresses the idea
          that the rate of change of the population, <m>\dfdx{P}{t}</m>, is
          proportional to the size of the population, <m>P</m>. The constant of
          proportionality is <m>0.3</m>, or <m>30%</m>.
        </p>



        <p>
          Clearly there is nothing particularly special about the number <m>0.3.</m>
          If our colony had been increasing at a <term>nominal</term> rate of <m>15%</m>
          we<rsq/>d have arrived at the IVP:
          <me>
            \dfdx{P}{t}=0.15P,\ \ P(0)=10.

        In general, if we start with a population of, say <m>P_0</m>, and the rate

        The constant <m>r</m> is called the <term>nominal</term> growth rate as we<rsq/>ve

      <p>
        The <xref ref="IVPExpGeneral">IVP</xref> should look familiar to you.  Notice that when

        Part (c) in <xref ref="PROBLEMBacteriaIVP1">Problem</xref> indicates that there

        its solution, <m>P(t)=10e^{0.3 t}</m>. If we use it to

        <m>P(365)=10e^{0.3\times365}\approx3.59\times10^{48}</m> grams.  Since
        current estimates of the mass of the entire universe are around
        <m>6\times10^{27}</m> grams, it is pretty clear that our model doesnâ€™t work
        in the long term.
      </p>

      <p>
        Clearly the bacteria can not sustain a growth rate of <m>30%</m>
        indefinitely.  If nothing else, they will eventually run out of
        food. Our point here is that this model, like all models, is
        limited. To use a mathematical model effectively we need to stay
        within its limitations.

        But in the short term this is actually a very good model. The picture

The green discoloration on the western side of the
        lake is from an explosive (exponential) growth of algae.  When the
        conditions for algae growth are nearly optimum <mdash/> if there is abundant
        food, there is room for the population to expand into, and the water
        temperature is exactly right <mdash/> the population of algae in Lake Erie
        tracks with our model nearly perfectly.
 The quantity of algae grows exponentially until
        the conditions become sub-optimal. Then the population of algae drops
        again to normal levels.

Except that the nominal

        An algal bloom can happen in any body of water where algae grow. They
        are common in alpine lakes in the early spring when nutrients are
        released by the melting snow, but the fish and insects that feed on
        the algae have not yet emerged in large numbers.  We will return to
        this problem in <xref ref="SECTIONpopulation-dynamics">Section</xref> where we will
        tweak this model to extend its usefulness to longer periods of
        time. But for now we will continue to use this exponential growth
        model with the understanding that for large values of <m>t</m> it is
        unreliable.

        Speaking loosely, the observation that lead us to <xref ref="IVPExpGeneral">IVP</xref>
        is that the number of baby bacteria in a given generation is
        proportional to how many parental bacteria were present in the
        previous generation. Speaking very loosely, more mamas and
        poppas now, means proportionally more babies later. This is all that
        is required for exponential growth to occur.

      <p>
        The natural exponential function also arises naturally in financial
        mathematics.  If we invest money in a bond which pays a <term>nominal
        interest</term> rate of <m>5%</m> annually, and the interest is
        <term>compounded</term> quarterly then the <term>effective yield</term> will be
        <m>5.09%</m>.
      </p>

      <p>
        There is a lot of financial jargon in the previous paragraph which
        makes it hard to understand if we don<rsq/>t speak financial-ese. So we
        will take a few pages to learn the vocabulary. After that things will
        clear up pretty quickly.
      </p>

      <p>
        To start, the effective yield represents the actual amount of money
        earned at the end of one year <mdash/> how much money the investment
        actually pays out.  For example, if the investment was not
        compounded at all, then at the end of one year, every dollar invested
        would yield <m>1.05</m> in return, so the effective yield is the same as
        the <term>nominal yield</term>: <m>5</m>.
      </p>



      <p>
        If the investment is compounded semiannually (twice per year), then
        half of interest earned is paid out midway through the year.  This
        money is then re-invested for the next half year.  This is summarized
        in the table below.

      <p>
        Notice how these three tables differ, and how they are similar to each
        other.  The effective yield comes from the last entry in each table.
        It is the difference between the amount
        the investment is worth at the end of the year and what it is worth at
        the beginning of the year. So if we compound quarterly the effective
        yield is <m>1.0509-1=0.0509=5.09\%. </m>
      </p>
      <p>
        
        Similarly, if the investment is compounded daily, then the effective
        yield is
        <m>\left(1+\frac{0.05}{365}\right)^{365}-1\approx0.0513 = 5.13\%</m>.  If
        we compound <m>5\%</m> nominal interest, <m>n</m> times in a year, then the
        return on an investment of one dollar at the end of one year would be
        <m>\left(1+\frac{0.05}{n}\right)^{n}</m> dollars, after <m>2</m> years
        <m>\left(1+\frac{0.05}{n}\right)^{2n}</m> dollars, after <m>3</m> years
        <m>\left(1+\frac{0.05}{n}\right)^{3n}</m> dollars.
      </p>

      <p>
        In general if we let <m>A(t)</m> denote the value of the
        investment of one dollar earning <m>5\%</m> annually, compounded
        <m>n</m> times per year, after <m>t</m> years, we have
        <me>
          A(t)=1\cdot\left(1+\frac{0.05}{n}\right)^{nt},\ t=0,1,2,\ldots
        </me>
      </p>

      <p>
        What if the investment was compounded continuously? That is,
        suppose the interest is being continuously paid out and
        simultaneously reinvested? Obviously, this can<rsq/>t actually be done,
        but it comes to the same thing if at the end of the year we get an
        effective yield that is equal to the effective yield that would
        come from continuous compounding. All we have to do is figure out
        what this is.
      </p>

      <p>
        To do this, it will be convenient to write <m>A(t)</m> as
        <md>
<mrow>        A(t)\amp =1\cdot\left(1+\frac{0.05}{n}\right)^{nt}</mrow>
<mrow>        \amp =1\cdot\left(\left(1+\frac{0.05}{n}\right)^{\frac{n}{0.05}}\right)^{0.05t}</mrow>
<mrow>        \amp =1\cdot\left(\left(1+\frac{1}{\frac{n}{0.05}}\right)^{\frac{n}{0.05}}\right)^{0.05t}</mrow>
        </md>
 Setting <m>m=\frac{n}{0.05}</m> we see that
<me>        A(t)=1\cdot\left(\left(1+\frac{1}{m}\right)^{m}\right)^{0.05t}.</me>

        We are particularly interested in the quantity
        <m>\left(1+\frac{1}{m}\right)^{m}</m> as we compound the interest more
        frequently (as <m>m</m> becomes very large).  The following table shows
        some values of <m>\left(1+\frac{1}{m}\right)^m</m>, for large values of
        <m>m</m>. Does the numbers in the right column look familiar to you?

            The function <m>A(t)</m> has the same form as our solution of

      <p>
        This is interesting. It appears that  <xref ref="EQUATIONGeneralExponentialSolution">IVP\</xref> models
        continuously compounded investments as well as population growth. Does
        this make sense to you?
      </p>
      <p>

        Think about it for a moment. When money invested the rate of return
        (rate of growth) is always proportional to the initial investment, in
        the same way that the rate of growth of a population (the rate of
        return) is.  Speaking very loosely, the amount of baby dollars in the
        next generation will be proportional to the amount
        of <url href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlbuGdoAFek" visual="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlbuGdoAFek">mama dollars
        and papa dollars</url> in the current generation in the same way that
        the number of baby bacteria in the next generation is proportional to
        the number of parent bacteria now.  So it makes sense that
        these two very different real world phenomena are modeled by the same
        IVP.
      </p>
      <p>
        
        From the point of view of a banker or a biologist, these are very
        different problems so we assign different meanings to the variables
        and parameters.  But since relationship between the variables and
        parameters is the same whatever we call them, to a mathematician these
        are the same problem.
      </p>
      <p>

        This sort of abstraction is one of the strengths of mathematics. It is
        not at all obvious that population growth, investment income, or
        nuclear decay (which we will study shortly) are all essentially the
        same problem.  It is only when we have abstracted out the critical
        features of each that we can see this.

        <p>
        In the <m>16</m>th and <m>17</m>th centuries the computational
        needs of science, introduction engineering, finance and
        navigation were growing increasingly complex, time-consuming,
        and error prone. The problem of navigating at sea using only
        the stars as a guide was particularly vexing.  It became
        increasingly important to find very accurate methods of
        computation that were also as simple as they could possibly
        be; that could be broken down into simple steps that anyone
        could do without necessarily understanding the underlying
        concepts.  The Scottish mathematician <url

        Napier described logarithms in
        <url href="https://www.maa.org/press/periodicals/convergence/mathematical-treasure-john-napier-s-mirifici-logarithmorum" visual="https://www.maa.org/press/periodicals/convergence/mathematical-treasure-john-napier-s-mirifici-logarithmorum"><foreign>Mirifici  logarithmorum canonis descriptio</foreign></url> (<pubtitle>A Wonderful Description of the Canon of Logarithms</pubtitle>), published in <m>1614</m>, well
        before Newton or Leibniz were born so logarithms actually predate the
        invention of Calculus by several decades.  He coined the term
        <q>logarithm</q> from the Greek words logos meaning
        <q>reasoning,</q> or <q>reckoning</q> and arithmos meaning
        <q>number.</q>  To Napier logarithms were <q>reckoning
        numbers</q> which seems an apt description, given their
        original purpose.  
      </p>

      <p>
        To see how logarithms work we start with the observation that
        <me>10^8=(10\cdot10\cdot10)\cdot(10\cdot10\cdot10\cdot10\cdot10)=10^{3+5}.</me>
        More generally, if <m>a</m> is any positive number and <m>m</m> and <m>n</m> are
        any real numbers then
        <me>
          a^{n+m} =a^n\cdot a^m,
        </me>
        The crucial observation here is that exponentiation (raising to a
        power) takes the addition of the exponents <m>n</m> and <m>m</m> and
        turns it into the multiplication of <m>a^n</m> and <m>a^m</m>. Of course,
        multiplying instead of adding makes computations more complex, not
        less.  This is exactly the reverse of what is needed. What Napier
        wanted was a way to turn the complexity of multiplication into the
        simplicity of addition. This would make complex computations --
        especially computations done by hand with paper and pencil
        (the only kind there was in those days) much simpler.
      </p>
      <p>

        To turn multiplication into addition all we have to do is read the
        equation <m>a^{n+m} =a^n\cdot a^m</m> in the other direction:
        <me>
          a^n\cdot a^m=a^{n+m}.
        </me>
        Now the multiplication of <m>a^n</m> and <m>a^m</m> has become the addition (in
        the exponent) of <m>n</m> and <m>m</m>. Of course there is much more to be done
        to make this a usable computational scheme. But this is the essential
        idea. For example if we wanted to use this scheme to multiply
        <m>123.2387\times 43.8378</m> we would first need to know that
        <m>123.2387 \approx 10^{2.0907}</m> and that <m>43.8378 \approx
        10^{1.6418}</m>. Adding the exponents gives <m>3.7325</m> so the result of the
        multiplication is <m>10^{3.7325}\approx5401</m>.  The way to make this a
        workable scheme is to compile a large table of numbers and their
        associated exponents. This is, essentially, what Napier
        did.
              </p>
<aside>
<title>Historical Background</title>
<p>
We<rsq/>re taking liberties with the history here. Napier<rsq/>s
        original scheme was not based on <m>10^x</m>.  We explain how Napier
        actually defined his logarithms in
        <xref ref="DIGRESSIONBriggsAndNapier" text="custom">Digression</xref>.  For now it is useful to
        pretend that he used <m>10^x</m>. Also, although Napier started compiling
        a table of logarithms, sadly he died before finishing.  It fell to
        his friend and colleague Henry Briggs to complete the task.
</p>
</aside>

      <p>
        Today we call <m>2.0907</m> and <m>1.6418</m> the <term>base 10</term>, or
        <term>common logarithms</term>, of <m>123.2387</m> , and <m>43.8378</m>,
        respectively. Notationally we have
<md>
<mrow>        \log_{10}(123.2387)\amp =2.0907</mrow>
<mrow>        \log_{10}(43.8378)\amp =1.6418</mrow>
</md>
        which is  simply a way to say
        <m>10^{2.0907} =123.2387</m> and <m>10^{1.6418}=43.8378</m> backwards.
      </p>
      <p>

        In general,
        <m>\log_{10}(10^n)=n</m>, and we see that the function <m>\log_{10}()</m>
        simply undoes the function <m>f(x) = 10^x</m>, which makes
        <m>\log_{10}()</m> the functional inverse of <m>f(x) = 10^x</m>, in exactly the
        same way that <m>\inverse\tan(x)</m> is the functional inverse of <m>\tan(x)</m>
        as you recall from <xref ref="SECTIONinverse-tan-and-cot"></xref>.
      </p>
      <p>


        To use a table of base <m>10</m> logarithms to find the product of two
        numbers we would first look up the logarithm of each number, then add
        the logarithms.  The resulting sum is the base <m>10</m> logarithm of the
        product, so we<rsq/>d look up in our table what this sum is the logarithm

        invention of modern computing technology the original purpose of base

        obsolete. So

        The graph of the natural exponential is very similar to the graph of
        <m>y=3^x</m>. As we saw in
        <xref ref="SECTIONinverse-tan-and-cot"></xref> if we have the  graph of some
        function we can find the graph of its inverse by interchanging the
        horizontal and vertical axes. As a practical matter, this is the same
        as reflecting the graph across the line, <m>y=x</m>. The graph of the
        natural exponential and its inverse the natural logarithm are shown in
        the diagram at the right.
      </p>
      <p>

        In the same way that <m>\log_{10}(x)</m> is the functional inverse of the
        base ten exponential, <m>10^x</m>, the <term>natural logarithm</term> - usually
        denoted  <m>\ln(x)</m> <mdash/> is the functional inverse of the
        natural exponential, <m>e^x</m>.
        This inverse relationship allows us to immediately observe several
        important properties of the natural logarithm.

<title>DIGRESSION: Exponential and Logarithmic Notation</title>
<p>
      Consider reviewing 
      <xref ref="DIGRESSIONInverse-function-notation" text="custom">DIGRESSION: Inverse Function Notation</xref>. It will probably help.
</p>
<p>

      As we<rsq/>ve observed the <term>natural logarithm</term> function is, by
      definition, the inverse of the <term>natural exponential</term> in
      precisely the same way that <m>\inverse\tan(x)</m> is, by definition, the
      inverse of <m>\tan(x)</m> .  Unfortunately the notation that is used for
      the <term>natural exponential</term> and the <term>natural logarithm</term> is
      not helpful.
</p>
<p>

      It has become standard practice to notate a function using the first
      three letters of its name. That is why the trigonometric functions
      are denoted <m>\sin</m>, <m>\cos</m>, <m>\tan</m>, <m>\cot</m>, <m>\sec</m>, and <m>\csc</m>. By
      that standard we should properly denote the natural exponential with
      <m>\exp(x)</m>. We have used this notation in the past and will continue
      to use it when we want to emphasize the functional nature of the
      natural exponential, but most of the time it is more helpful to
      think of it as the number <q><m>e</m> raised to a power</q> and to denote it
      with <m>e^x</m> which, unfortunately, doesn<rsq/>t look like the name of a
      function at all.
</p>
<p>

  As we saw in <xref ref="DIGRESSIONInverse-function-notation" text="custom">DIGRESSION:Inverse Function Notation</xref>. This is
      unfortunate for the student because it adheres to no standard naming
      scheme whatsoever. But once you get used to it, it isn<rsq/>t so bad.
</p>
<p>

      Sometimes there are reasons to use logarithms with bases other than
      <m>10</m> or <m>e</m>. For example, computer scientists frequently use
      logarithms with a base of <m>2</m> which they denote <m>\text{lb}(x)</m>
      (binary logarithm).
</p>
<aside>
<title>Mathematical Customs</title>
<p>
  Even worse, when we talk among ourselves
      mathematicians tend to use the natural logarithm because for us it
      is the most important, but we often denote it as <q><m>\log(x)</m>.</q>
      When we are talking to scientists and engineers we use whichever notation is
      appropriate to their discipline.
</p>
</aside>

<p>


      None of this affects what the natural logarithm is, how we use it,
      or how we think about it. Only how we write it. We only bring this
      up to warn you that because of this wide variation in usage
      logarithmic notation can be hard to get comfortable with. Be
      careful. The generic notation is <m>\log_b(x)</m> where <m>b</m> indicates the
      base. In this scheme the natural logarithm is <m>\log_{e}(x)</m>, the common
      logarithm is <m>\log_{10}(x)</m>, and the binary logarithm is
      <m>\log_{2}(x)</m>. If you find yourself getting confused it can help to
      revert to this generic notation.
</p>
<p>

      It is, after all, just notation. Do not confuse the name of a
      concept with the concept itself. Conceptually the natural
      logarithm (<m>\ln(x)</m>) is the inverse of the natural exponential
      (<m>e^x</m>) and you should think of it as such.
</p>
<p>

      It is often helpful to think of <m>\ln(x)</m> as the function that peels
      the exponent off of <m>e^x</m> as in Property #1: <m>\ln(e^x)=x</m>.

      <p>
        Take the time to become very comfortable using all of the properties
        of logarithms, for exactly the same reason you took time to become
        very comfortable with the differentiation rules: Exponential and
        logarithmic functions are basic tools in science.
      </p>

      <problem>
        <statement>
          <p>
            Like Property #3, Property #5 is really just a convenience. Show that it is really
            an immediate consequence of Property #4 and Property #6.
          </p>
        </statement>
<hint>
<p>
Find a way to express <m>a/b</m> as a product.

</hint>
      </problem>


      <p>
        The simplest use to which we can put a <term>natural logarithm</term> is to
        aid in solving an equation like:
        <me>
          3^x=17.
        </me>
        The difficulty here is that the variable <m>x</m> is in the exponent so to
        isolate it we have to <q>undo</q> an exponential. This is exactly
        what logarithms do!  By Property #6, <m>\ln(3^x)=x\ln(3)</m>, so we can
        solve our equation like this:
        <md>
          <mrow>
            3^x\amp=17
          </mrow>
          <mrow>
            \ln(3^x)\amp = \ln(17)
          </mrow>
          <mrow> x\ln(3)\amp= \ln(17)\\</mrow>
          <mrow> x\amp=\frac{\ln(17)}{\ln(3)}.</mrow>
        </md>

        At this point we can use technology to find that
        <m>\ln(17) \approx 2.8332</m> and <m>\ln(3)\approx1.0986</m> so that
        <m>x=\frac{\ln(17)}{\ln(3)}\approx2.5789</m>.
      </p>

            Use your favorite computational tool to confirm that <m>3^{2.5789}\approx 17</m>.

      <p>
        When we were modeling exponential population growth, we always stated
        the relative growth rate for you, but in real applications this rate
        will rarely be known <foreign>a priori</foreign>.  Usually we will have to
        compute the relative growth rate based on other information from the
        problem. For this, logarithms are needed. An example will help to
        clarify what we mean.
      </p>

      <example>
        <p>

          Suppose we have a bacteria culture which grows at a rate
          proportional to the amount of bacteria present.  Suppose further
          that it has been observed that we have <m>2</m> grams of the bacteria
          initially, then <m>24</m> hours later we have <m>3</m> grams.  Can we predict
          how much would we have in <m>48</m> hours?
        </p>

        <p>
          Let <m>B(t)</m> represent the amount of bacteria present. This time
          our model is
          <md>
            <mrow>
              \dfdx{B}{t}\amp =rB, \text{ (The growth rate is proportional to the amount of bacteria present.)} 
            </mrow>
            <mrow>
              B(0)\amp =2, \text{ (Initially we have }2 \text{ grams of bacteria.)}\\
            </mrow>
            <mrow>
              B(24)\amp =3.\text{ (There are } 3 \text{ grams of bacteria
              present after }24 \text{ hours.)}

      <exercise xml:id="DRILLBacteriaGuess1">
        <statement>
          <p>
            Before we proceed, try to guess how much bacteria we will have
            after <m>48</m> hours.  Will it be <m>4</m> grams?  <m>6</m> grams? More?  Less?
            Write down your best guess. We will revisit this in
            <xref ref="DRILLBacteriaGuess2"></xref>, as soon as we have a formula
            for <m>B(t)</m>.
          </p>
        </statement>
      </exercise>
      <p>
 
       Note that our model is an IVP plus the extra datum: <m>B(24)=3</m>. The first
        two pieces of our model, <m> \dfdx{B}{t}=rB</m>, and <m> B(0)=2</m>, define an
        IVP very similar to <xref ref="EQUATIONBacteriaIVP">IVP</xref>.
        In fact the only difference is that where we had <m>0.3</m> before, we
        now have the unknown parameter, <m>r</m>.  In
        <xref ref="PROBLEMBacteriaIVP1"></xref> we saw that
        <m> y(t)=10e^{0.3t}, </m> so it appears that the solution of the
        problem in this example must be
        <me>
          y(t)=2e^{rt}
        </me>
        but we don<rsq/>t know the value of <m>r</m> (yet).
      </p>
      <p>


        To determine <m>r</m>, we use the second datum. Since <m>B(24)=3</m> we have
        <m>
          \frac32=e^{24r}</m>.
          Had we not taken the trouble to invent the natural logarithm it
          would be very difficult to proceed from this point.  Since we did
          take the trouble, the next step is  straightforward. Taking the
          natural logarithm of both sides, we see that
          <m>\ln\left(\frac{3}{2}\right)=24r</m> or
          <me>
            \frac{1}{24}\ln\left(\frac{3}{2}\right)=r.
          </me>
          Thus our growth model for this bacterial growth culture is
          <me>B(t)=2e^{\left(\frac{1}{24} \ln \frac{3}{2}\right)t}.</me>
      </p>
      <p>

        Expressing it in this form is cumbersome. It is not wrong, just
        awkward.  We can use the properties of exponents to clean it up at
        bit. This is not strictly necessary, but in general the simpler we
        keep our notation the better.  Using the properties of exponents and
        the mutually inverse nature of the natural exponential and the
        natural logarithm, we have
        <me>
          B(t)=2e^{\left(\frac{1}{24} \ln\left(3/2\right)t\right)} =
          2\left(e^{\ln\left(\frac32\right)}\right)^\frac{t}{24}
          =2\left(\frac{3}{2}\right)^{\frac{t}{24}}.
        </me>
      </p>
      <p>

        So after <m>48</m> hours we have
        <me>
          B(48)=2\left(\frac{3}{2}\right)^{48/24}=2\left(\frac{3}{2}\right)^2=2\left(\frac{9}{4}\right)=\frac{9}{2}=4.5
          \text{ grams}.
        </me>

    <subsection xml:id="SUBSECTIONradioactive-decay">
      <title>Radioactive Dating</title>

      <p>
        Radioactive isotopes have the curious property that in time they break
        down into other, more stable, substances. This process is known as
        <term>radioactive decay</term>.
        While there is no way to predict when an
        individual radioactive atom will decay, the decay of a large
        collection of radioactive isotopes is very regular and can be
        predicted.
      </p>
      <p>

        For example, if we have two pounds of the radioactive isotope
        Cesium-137 <m>(\text{Cs}{137})</m> it is known that after the passage of
        <m>30</m> years and <m>70</m> days we will have only one pound. The rest will
        have decayed into barium.  Even more curious though, is this: If we
        wait another <m>30</m> years and <m>70</m> days only one-half pound of the
        remaining one pound will have decayed.  The numbers change depending
        on the isotope but the general principle is that a fixed percentage of
        a radioactive isotope will decay during a fixed interval of time.
      </p>
      <p>

        Do you see the implications of this? Since a fixed percentage decays
        in a fixed time interval the rate of change of <m>A(t)</m> will be
        proportional to <m>A</m> itself. Since this is exactly what we said about
        both population growth and return on investment,
        <xref ref="IVPExpGeneral">IVP</xref>
        should model this phenomenon as well. There is, of course, the
        difference that the quantity is now shrinking rather than growing. How
        do you think that will manifest in our model? Take a guess.
      </p>

      <example xml:id="EXAMPLEradioactive-dating">
        <p>
          For the sake of being definite suppose that our
          isotope is decaying (shrinking) at a <term>relative</term>
          (<term>nominal</term>) rate of  <m>25%</m>. Then if we start
          with <m>20</m>Kg, the IVP to be solved is
          <men  xml:id="IVPRadioactiveDecay-Wrong">
            <!-- \label{IVPRadioactiveDecay-Wrong} -->
            \dfdx{A}{t}= 0.25A,\ A(0)=20.
          </men>
          which we recognize as a special case of <xref ref="IVPExpGeneral">IVP</xref>, so
          the solution will be
          <me>
            A(t)=20e^{0.25t}
          </me>
        </p>

        <p>
          Wait a minute. This can<rsq/>t be right. It says that the number of
          isotopes is increasing, not decreasing. Graph it and see.
        </p>
        <p>

          So what did we do wrong?
        </p>
        <p>

          The derivative of <m>A(t)</m> is its rate of change. If <m>A(t)</m> is
          increasing then its rate of change is going to be positive. If it is
          decreasing then its rate of change will be negative. We seem to have
          committed one of the classic blunders of mathematics. We got the
          sign wrong. We should have been solving  the IVP
          <men  xml:id="IVPRadioactiveDecay-Correct">

          Suppose we have <m>6</m> pounds of a very unstable isotope which is known
          to lose half of its mass to radioactive decay in <m>2</m> hours. If we
          let <m>y(t)</m> be the mass of our isotope sample at any time <m>t</m>, then
          the IVP we need to solve is\aside{In view of our discussion above
          about positive versus negative rates of change it is tempting to
          write the differential equation as <m>\dfdx{y}{t}=-ry</m>. While this
          is not necessarily wrong, it is not helpful. The variable <m>r</m> can
          be any number, positive or negative. If we do our analysis
          correctly the correct value will emerge.

          where and <m>r</m> is an unknown constant.  To find <m>r</m> we must use the
          additional information given.  Half of our isotope<rsq/>s mass is
          lost in <m>2</m> hours, so <m>y(2)=3</m>. Thus

      <p>
        Radiocarbon <m>(C_{14})</m> is a radioactive isotope of carbon which is
        constantly being created in the atmosphere by the interaction of
        cosmic rays with atmospheric nitrogen. The resulting radiocarbon
        combines with atmospheric oxygen to form radioactive carbon dioxide,
        which is incorporated into plants by photosynthesis.
        Animals then acquire <m>C_{14}</m> by eating the plants. When the animal or
        plant dies, it stops absorbing carbon from the environment. From
        that point onward the amount of <m>C_{14}</m> it contains begins to
        decrease as the <m>C_{14}</m> undergoes radioactive decay. During life the
        ratio of <m>C_{14}</m> to other, stable, isotopes remains stable. However
        after an organism dies this ratio begins to decrease due to the decay
        of <m>C_{14}</m>
      </p>
      <p>

        By measuring the amount of <m>C_{14}</m> in a sample from a dead plant or
        animal such as a piece of wood or a fragment of bone we can calculate,
        approximately when the plant or animal died. This is called
        <term>radiocarbon dating</term>, and it was developed
        by
        <url href="https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/chemistry/1960/libby/biographical/" visual="https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/chemistry/1960/libby/biographical/">Willard
        Libby</url> (1908-1980), in <m>1949</m>. Radiocarbon dating revolutionized
        the field of archaeology and   Libby was awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry
        in <m>1960</m> for this development.

          temperature of, for example, <m>32^\circ F</m> where it will start to
          freeze.

<idx><h>Newton, Isaac</h><h>and the Law of Cooling</h></idx>
          In the late <m>17</m>th century Isaac Newton showed experimentally that
          the rate at which the water cools will be proportional to the
          difference between its current temperature and the ambient
          (surrounding) temperature. This is known as Newton<rsq/>s Law of Cooling
          and it holds generally, not just for water.
        </p>
        <p>

          For this problem we see that the ambient temperature is <m>5^\circ F</m>
          and the initial temperature of the water is <m>40^\circ F</m>.  We let
          <m>T(t)</m> represent the temperature of the water at any given
          time. Then the difference between the current temperature and the
          ambient temperature
          is <m> T-5</m>, and (as always) the rate of change of the temperature of
          the water with respect to time is <m>\dfdx{T}{t}</m>, (or <m>\dot{T}</m> if
          you are Newton). Letting <m>r</m> be the (unknown) constant of
          proportionality we have the IVP
          <md>
<mrow>            \dfdx{T}{t}=r(T-5),\amp{}\amp{} T(0)=40.</mrow>
          </md>
        </p>
        <p>

          This differential equation looks like it will be tougher to solve
          than the IVPs we dealt with earlier. But in fact we can make this
          problem <q>easier on the eyes</q> with the substitution <m>D=T-5</m>.
          Notice that <m>\dfdx{D}{t}=\dfdx{(T-5)}{t}=\dfdx{T}{t}</m> so we have the
          IVP

<mdn>
          <mrow xml:id="EQUATIONCoolingIVP1">

          </mrow>
</mdn>
          Do you recognize this equation? This has the same form as
          <xref ref="EQUATIONBacteriaIVP">IVP</xref> so the solution is
          <me>
            D(t)=D(0) e^{rt}=35e^{rt}.
          </me>
          Reversing the substitution we see that

          To complete our model we need to determine <m>r</m>. We can find <m>r</m> if
          we know the temperature of the water at a second time during the
          cooling.  Assume that we measured the temperature of the water after
          <m>10</m> minutes and it was <m>35^\circ F.</m> Thus we have

<title>The Derivative of the Natural Logarithm</title>

<p>
  Since the <term>natural logarithm</term> is the inverse of the <term>natural
  exponential</term> we can find its derivative using the same trick that we
  used to find the derivatives of the inverse trig functions.  Start
  with the identity from Logarithm Property #1:
  <men xml:id="EQUATIONUseProp1">e^{\ln(x)} =x </men>
  and  make this easier on our eyes with the substitution
  <m>y=\ln(x)</m>. Differentiating <xref ref="EQUATIONUseProp1">equation</xref>
  we see that
  <me> e^y\dx{y}  = \dx{x}</me>.
  Thus
  <me>\dx{y} =\frac{1}{e^y}\dx{x}</me>.
  Once more making the  substitution <m>y=\ln(x)</m>  we have
  <me>  \dx{y} =\frac{1}{e^{\ln(x)}}\dx{x}</me>,
  and since <m>e^{\ln(x)}=x</m> we have
  <me>  \dx{y} =\frac{1}{x}\dx{x}</me>.
  <me>  \dx{y} =\frac{1}{x}\dx{x}</me>
  <men  xml:id="EQUATIONNatLogDeriv1"> \dx{(\ln(x))}  =x^{-1} \dx{x}.</men>
  <xref ref="EQUATIONNatLogDeriv1">equation</xref> is the last differentiation rule you
  need to memorize. Memorize it.
</p>

<p>
  As always the difficulty here is not remembering what the
  differentiation rule is, the difficulty is in learning to use it in
  tandem with all of the other rules. So practice is required. Lots of
  practice.

<p>
  Observe that if <m>y=x^\alpha,</m> then
  <m>\dfdx{y}{x}=\alpha x^{\alpha-1}.</m> This is, of course, just the
  Power Rule but we take particular notice of the fact that the Power
  Rule guarantees that the derivative of any monomial <m>(x^\alpha)</m> is
  another monomial. But what happens if we try to go the other
  direction?
</p>
<aside>
<title>Comment</title>
<p>
Actually, this should be
    <m>y=\frac{x^3}{3}</m> plus an arbitrary constant. Do you see
    why? Since the constant is of no importance to our current point,
    we ignore it. 
</p>
</aside>

<p>
  If <m>\dfdx{y}{x}=x^2</m> then clearly <m>y=\frac{x^3}{3}</m>. In general if
  <me>\dfdx{y}{x}=x^\alpha</me> then 

<md>
<mrow>y= \frac{x^{\alpha+1}}{\alpha+1}\amp{}\amp{} \text{ for }\amp{}\amp{} \alpha\ne -1.</mrow>
</md>

 But if <m>\alpha=-1</m> running the Power Rule backwards
  would give us <m>y= \frac{x^{-1+1}}{-1+1}</m> which is meaningless since
  the denominator is <m>-1+1=0.</m> When <m>\alpha=-1</m> we get
  is <m>y=\ln(x).</m>
</p>

<p>
  It seems very strange that there would be this one, single exception
  doesn<rsq/>t it?  Or, to come at the question a little differently, maybe
  this says that the logarithm function is somehow related to
  polynomials? What do you think?

<title>General Exponentials</title>

<p>
  So far we<rsq/>ve focused on the <term>natural</term> exponential and logarithm
  functions even though we started our discussion of logarithms by
  defining <m>\log_{10}(x)</m> as the inverse of the base-<m>10</m> exponential:
  <m>10^x</m>.
</p>
<p>
  But we<rsq/>ve seen that  <m>2^x</m> is also an exponential, and it<rsq/>s  inverse
  is <m>\log_2(x)</m>. In fact, we<rsq/>ve seen that for any
  <m>a\gt 0</m>, <m>a\neq1</m>, <m>a^x</m> is the <q>base <m>a</m></q> exponential and the
  corresponding inverse function is called the <q>base <m>a</m></q> logarithm,
  and is denoted <m>\log_a(x)</m>.
</p>

<exercise>
  <statement>
    <p>
      Why do we impose the conditions, <m>a\gt 0</m> and <m>a\neq1</m>?

  Calculus is not needed for the next problem which establishes that all
  logarithm functions change multiplication into addition (Property 4)
  and exponentiation into multiplication (Property 6) as we stated
  (but didn<rsq/>t prove) earlier.

<p>
  But if there are so many different exponential and logarithm
  functions, don<rsq/>t we need differentiation rules for all of them? If
  so, what are the derivatives of the other exponentials and
  logarithms?
</p>


<p>

  It is not as hard to differentiate <m>y=a^x</m> as you might think. Since
  we already know how to differentiate the natural exponential
  all we have to do is re-express <m>y=a^x</m> in terms of <m>e^x</m>.
</p>
<p>

  Here<rsq/>s how to do that. Recall that from the inverse relationship
  between the natural exponential and the natural logarithm (Properties
  1 and 2) <m>a=e^{\ln(a)}</m>. So we make that
  substitution to
  get
  <me>
    y=a^x=\left(e^{\ln(a)}\right)^x=e^{x\ln(a)}
</me>
</p>
<aside>
<title>Comment</title>
<p>
Some may see this step as making <m>a^x</m> <q>harder on the eyes,</q>
rather than easier, but often it is often necessary to temporarily
make things more complicated so that we can recognize a pattern or to
reduce the situation to a previously solved problem.
</p>
<p>
Don<rsq/>t become rigid in your approach to problem solving. Remain flexible.
</p>
</aside>


<p>
  Now differentiate:
  <md>
    <mrow>
      a^x\amp =e^{x\ln(a)}
    </mrow>
    <mrow>
      \dx(a^x) \amp = \dx{\left(e^{x\ln(a)}\right)}= e^{x\ln(a)}\dx(x\ln(a)).
    </mrow>
  </md>

  Since <m>a</m> is a constant, <m>\ln(a)</m> is also a constant so
  <me>
    \dx(a^x) = e^{x\ln(a)}\ln(a)\dx{x},
</me>
and since <m>a^x=e^{x\ln(a)}</m> we have
<me>
  \dx(a^x) = a^x\ln(a)\dx{x}.
</me>
Many people simply memorize this formula and you are welcome to do
that if you like. However we (the authors) prefer to emulate nature
and be lazy. We find it much simpler to find the derivative of
<m>a^x</m> by rewriting it as <m>e^{x\ln(a)}</m> first.
</p>
<p>
  The following problem shows an alternative (and equivalent) method if
  you can<rsq/>t remember how to rewrite <m>a^x</m>.
</p>

<problem>
  <statement>
    <p>
      Starting with <m>y=a^x</m>, take the natural logarithm of both sides and
      solve for <m>\dx{y}</m> to obtain the same formula as above.
</p>
</statement>
</problem>
<p>
  Taking a logarithm of complicated formulas sometimes allows us to
  simplify things considerably via the properties of logarithms. It is a
  nice trick. Keep it in mind. We<rsq/>ll be using it later.

<p>

Just as we computed the derivative of the general exponential, <m>a^x</m>
by re-expressing it as a natural exponential, we will compute the
derivative of the general logarithm, <m>\log_a(x)</m>, by re-expressing it
as a natural logarithm. This is a bit more difficult, but only a bit.
</p>
<p>

  We begin with the exponential. If <m>y=\log_a(x)</m> then
  <m> a^y=x</m>. Taking the natural logarithm of both
  sides of <m> a^y=x</m> and using Property 6 we have, <m> y\ln(a)=\ln(x)</m>,  or
  <m>y=\frac{\ln(x)}{\ln(a)}</m>.
  Since <m>y=\log_a(x)</m> we have successfully re-expressed the
  base-<m>a</m> logarithm as a natural logarithm:
  <men  xml:id="EQUATIONGenLogConversion">
    \log_a(x)=\frac{\ln(x)}{\ln(a)}.
<!-- \label{eq:GenLogConversion} -->
</men>
This is why many scientific calculators don<rsq/>t bother including a
<m>\log_a(x)</m> button.
</p>
<p>

  An easy mnemonic for remembering this formula is to simply notice that
  on both sides of the equation the <m>a</m> appears lower than the <m>x</m>.
</p>
<p>

  Since <m>\ln(a)</m> is a constant (why?) we have
  <me>
    \dx{(\log_a(x))}=\frac{1}{\ln(a)}\cdot\dx\left(\ln(x)\right)=\frac{1}{\ln(a)}\cdot\frac1x\dx{x}.
</me>
So we have the differentiation formula:
<me>
  \dfdx{(\log_a(x))}{x}=\frac{1}{x\ln(a)}.
</me>
</p>
<p>
  As with the differentiation formula for  general exponential functions
  we (the authors) find it easier to remember this conversion than the
  differentiation formula. But you are welcome to memorize it if you
  prefer.

<title>DIGRESSION: Common and Napierian Logarithms</title>

<!-- \begin{Digression}[Common and Napierian Logarithms] -->
<!--   \label{digress:BriggsAndNapier} -->
<p>  
It is a well worn truism among research mathematicians that the
  first solution of a substantial problem is frequently both very hard
  to understand and very hard to convey to others, even to other
  mathematicians. We publish our solutions, in part, so that others can
  look at the problem, consider the approach used,  and find simplifications that the original
  investigator missed.
</p>
<p>
 This is what happened to Napier. Although his original scheme
  allowed him to convert multiplication to addition it was more
  complicated than necessary.  Shortly after Napier published his work
  in
  <m>1614</m>,
  <url href="https://mathshistory.st-andrews.ac.uk/Biographies/Briggs/" visual="https://mathshistory.st-andrews.ac.uk/Biographies/Briggs/">Henry
    Briggs</url> (1561<ndash/>1630), Professor of Geometry at Gresham College
  in London, visited Napier and suggested that a few simple changes to
  his logarithm table would make it more practical. In particular it
  was Briggs who suggested that since our number system is in
  base-<m>10</m>, creating a table of base-<m>10</m> logarithms might be more
  useful.
</p>
<p>

  Napier had had the same idea himself, but was unable to pursue it
  <q>on account of ill-health.</q> As a result, Briggs took on the task
  of computing tables of base-<m>10</m> logarithms, collaborating with
  Napier until the latter<rsq/>s death two years later. The results of
  their collaboration are known as the Briggsian or <term>Common
    Logarithms</term>. Common Logarithms are the base <m>10</m> logarithms we
  discussed earlier and were an important computational aid for nearly
  <m>400</m> years until the invention of modern computational
  technologies.
</p>
<p>

  As the mathematical historian Howard Eves put it, the invention of
  (common) logarithms literally <q>doubled the life of the
  astronomer,</q> because they so drastically reduced the time spent
  doing arithmetic.
</p>
<p>

Most modern scientific calculators have both the natural and the
common logarithms built in.  The <q><term>ln</term></q> button on a calculator
computes natural logarithms while the <q><term>log</term></q> computes common
logarithms.

<example>

<p>
  A calculator is a useful tool, but only if the human operating it
  understands what to calculate, and why. Blind computation is
  pointless and wasteful. As powerful and convenient as our modern
  technology is, there is still no substitution for a deep
  understanding of basic principles.
</p>

<p>
  For example, how many base-<m>10</m> digits long do you suppose the
  number <m>2^{1234567890}</m> is? You cannot solve this by punching
  <m>2^{1234567890}</m> into a calculator and counting the digits. Try it
  and see.  If you can solve this by punching <m>2^{1234567890}</m> into a
  calculator, that just means that technology has outpaced this
  particular problem. In that case use a bigger exponent, say <m>12345678901234567890</m>.
</p>

<p>
  This feels like the sort of problem a math professor might make up
  just for fun (though it often feels like we do it just to torment
  our students), but it is not. Computer programmers
  routinely have to allocate space in memory to hold information. If
  the information being held happens to be the number <m>2^{1234567890}</m>
  the programmer will need to know how much space to allocate to hold
  the number.
</p>
</example>

  <exercise>
<statement>
<p>
    Show that if <m>n</m> is a positive integer and
    <m>10^n\le\alpha\lt 10^{n+1}</m> then <m>\alpha</m> will have <m>n+1</m> digits to
    the left of the decimal point. \\
  </p>
</statement>
<hint>
<p>
This is true because our
      number system is based on <q>powers of ten.</q> That is, it is
      based on the base <m>10</m> exponential.
</p>
</hint>
</exercise>

<p>
  Suppose we let <m>\alpha = 2^{1234567890}</m> and take the base <m>10</m> logarithm
  (common logarithm) of both sides. This gives:
  <me>
  \log_{10}(\alpha)= \log_{10}(2^{1234567890})=1234567890\cdot
  \log_{10}(2)\approx371641966.574.
  </me>
  Thus
  <md>
<mrow>

    2^{1234567890}=\alpha\amp\approx 10^{371641966.574}\\
</mrow>

<mrow>

    \amp\approx 10^{0.574}\times10^{371641966}
</mrow>
<mrow>
\amp\approx 3.75      \times10^{371641966}.

</mrow>
</md>

  Since <m>10^{371641966}\le 2^{1234567890}\le 10^{371641967}</m> our
  number, <m>\alpha</m>, is <m>371641967</m> base-<m>10</m> digits long.  But since
  computer arithmetic is binary (base-<m>2</m>) what we really need to know
  how many binary digits (bits) are needed to store a given number.
</p>

    <exercise>
<p>
    How many bits are needed to allocate to store these

<p>
The discussion above suggests the question: What base did Napier use
when he first invented logarithms, before Briggs suggested using base-<m>10</m>?
</p>
<p>
Napier defined his original logarithms as follows.  Consider a point
<m>C</m> moving along line segment <m>AB</m> and a point <m>F</m> moving along an
infinite ray <m>DE</m> as seen below.
</p>
<image source="images/NapierLog1.png" width="40%" />

<!-- \includegraphics*[height=.5in,width=1.5in]{../Figures/NapierLog1} -->
<p>
At the beginnning both <m>C</m> and <m>F</m> are moving at the same speed, and
<m>F</m> continues to move at that initial speed. But the speed of <m>C</m> is
always equal to the distance from <m>C</m> to <m>B</m>.  If we let <m>CB=x</m> and
<m>DF=y</m>, then we define the <term>Naperian Logarithm</term> as
<me>
y = \text{Nap log}(x).
</me>
</p>
<p>

Since Calculus hadn<rsq/>t been invented yet, Napier used Trigonometry to
develop his table of logarithms. The details of those computations are
not relevant for us, except that he took the length of <m>AB</m> to be
<m>10^7</m>, because the best sine tables at the time were to accurate to
seven decimal places.
</p>
<p>



  It is not altogether clear from the description above that the
  Napierian logarithm actually is a logarithm, let alone what its base
  is. The next  problem explores both of these questions.

<title>Logarithmic Differentiation</title>
<p>
  Recall that in <xref ref="SECTIONsome-rules-diff"></xref> we observed that the
  Power Rule does not easily extend to <m>y=x^\alpha</m>, where <m>\alpha</m> is
  an irrational number. The properties of the natural exponential and
  the natural logarithm functions will (finally) allow us to make this
  extension.
  </p>
  <aside>
<title>Comment</title>
<p>
In particular we do not assume that <m>\alpha</m> is rational.
</p>
</aside>

<p>
  Suppose <m>\alpha</m> is any real number.  Starting with <m>y=x^\alpha</m> we
  take the logarithm of both sides, obtaining
  <me>
    \ln(y)=\alpha\ln(x).
</me>
Differentiating gives
<me>
  \frac1y\dx{y}=\alpha\frac1x\dx{x}.
</me>
Solving for <m>x</m> we see that
<men  xml:id="EQUATIONGeneralPowerRule">
  \dfdx{y}{x}=\frac{\alpha y}{x}=\frac{\alpha
  x^\alpha}{x}=\alpha x^{\alpha-1}
</men>
which  is the Power Rule. Since we did not constraint <m>\alpha</m> except
to say that it is a real number the different versions of the Power Rule
that we saw in <xref ref="SECTIONsome-rules-diff"></xref> are all special
cases of <xref ref="EQUATIONGeneralPowerRule"></xref>.
</p>
<p>
  The same trick we just used can make some differentiations much easier
  to do.
</p>
<example>
  <p>
    For example, suppose we need to differentiate
    <me>
      y=\frac{\sqrt{x^3+2x}\cdot \tan(x)}{(x^5-7)^4}.
</me>
</p>
<p>
  While we can do this using our Differentiation Rules, it will be
  very tedious.  But nice things happen if we take the natural
  logarithm of both sides before we differentiate.
<me>    \ln(y) =\ln\left(\frac{\sqrt{x^3+2x}\cdot \tan(x)}{(x^5-7)^4} \right)</me>
Since the natural  logarithm changes division
into subtraction (Property 5) we
can rewrite the right side as:
<me>       =\ln\left[\sqrt{x^3+2x}\cdot\tan(x)\right] -
\ln\left(\left(x^5-7\right)^4\right).</me>
And since the  natural  logarithm changes
multiplication    into addition (Property 4) we can
re-express  the right side again. This time as:
<me>       =\ln\left(\sqrt{x^3+2x}\right)+ \ln\left(\tan(x)\right) -
\ln\left(\left(x^5-7\right)^4\right).</me>
Re-expressing the square root as an exponent
gives
<me>       =\ln\left(x^3+2x\right)^{1/2}+ \ln\left(\tan(x)\right) -
\ln\left(\left(x^5-7\right)^4\right)</me>.
and we can now bring the exponents down
in front (Property 6).
<me>        \ln(y)     =\frac{1}{2}  \ln(x^3+2x)+\ln(\tan(x)) -4 \ln(x^5-7)).</me>
Notice that we have not yet started differentiating. All we<rsq/>ve done
so far is re-express our function using the properties of
logarithms.
</p>
<p>
  But differentiating is now relatively easy.

      \dx{(\ln(y))}\amp =  \frac{1}{2(x^3+2x)}\dx{(x^3+2x)}+\frac{1}{\tan(x)}\dx{(\tan{x})}-\frac{4}{x^5-7}\dx{(x^5-7)}\\
</mrow>

  \frac{\dx{y}}{y}\amp =              \frac{1}{2(x^3+2x)}(3x^2+2)\dx{x}+\frac{1}{\tan(x)}\sec^2(x)\dx{x}-\frac{4}{x^5-7}(5x^4)\dx{x}\\

</example>
<p>
  This looks like a lot of work when it<rsq/>s laid out on the page but it
  really isn<rsq/>t. With practice you can differentiate an expression like
  <m> \frac{\sqrt{x^3+2x}\cdot \tan(x)}{(x^5-7)^4}</m> in your head as fast
  as you can write it down. Really.  Even if this is not true, would you
  rather compute this derivative using the Quotient Rule and Product
  Rule?

  not a monomial like <m>x^2</m> nor is it an exponential like
  <m>2^x</m>.  This is some strange combination of both and  our existing

    <p>
      Recall that in <xref ref="SUBSECTIONsimple-harm-oscill">Section</xref> we saw that the
      differential equation that models the motion of an object having mass
      <m>m</m>, bouncing on a spring without resistance is the simple harmonic
      oscillator equation:
      <men  xml:id="EQUATIONSHO6">

        m\dfdxn{y}{t}{2}= -ky,
<!-- \label{eq:SHO6} -->

      </men>
      where <m>k</m> is the spring constant.  The solution of
      <xref ref="EQUATIONSHO6">equation</xref> is
      <men  xml:id="EQUATIONSHOSpringSolution1">

        y(t)=A\sin\sqrt{\frac{k}{m}}t+B\cos\sqrt{\frac{k}{m}}t
        <!-- \label{eq:SHOSpringSolution1} -->

      </men>
      where <m>A</m> and <m>B</m> are arbitrary constants.
    </p>
    <p>

      <xref ref="EQUATIONSHOSpringSolution1">Equation</xref> is
      unrealisitic because the oscillations described never vary.  In
      the real world, as a result of friction, the spring<rsq/>s
      oscillations will get shorter and shorter, eventually stopping
      altogether. How could we modify this model in order to capture
      the effects of, say, air resistance?
    </p>
    <p>

      A relatively simple way to model this resistance is to assume that the
      resistive force is proportional to the speed of the object. This
      sounds imposing but you are quite familiar with this sort of
      resistance. If you put your hand out the window of a moving car
      you<rsq/>ll notice that as the car moves faster there is more force (wind)
      pushing back on your hand.  This simple model breaks down at high
      speeds where factors such as turbulence will also affect the
      resistance, but it can be shown experimentally that the assumption
      that the resistive force is proportional to velocity works well for
      our spring.
</p>
<p>


  Putting the words <q>resistance is proportional to velocity</q> into
  symbols means we need to add the term <m>-b\dfdx{y}{t}</m> to
  <xref ref="EQUATIONSHO6">equation</xref> where <m>b\gt0</m> is a constant which depends on
  the viscosity of the ambient medium (air, in this case).  (Why must
  this proportionality be negative?)
</p>

<p>
  Thus our model for harmonic oscillation with resistance becomes
  <me>
    m\dfdxn{y}{t}{2}=-b\dfdx{y}{t}-ky
</me>
or
<men  xml:id="EQUATIONDampedOscillator1">
  \dfdxn{y}{t}{2}+\frac{b}{m}\dfdx{y}{t}+\frac{k}{m}y = 0.
<!-- \label{eq:DampedOscillator1} -->
</men>
<xref ref="EQUATIONDampedOscillator1">Equation</xref> is a little scary to look at, let alone
try to solve.  We<rsq/>ll begin with a simplified version where
<m>b=k=m</m>:
<men  xml:id="EQUATIONDampedProblem1">
  \dfdxn{y}{t}{2}+\dfdx{y}{t}+y=0.

<title>Historical Background</title>
<p>
<url href="https://mathshistory.st-andrews.ac.uk/Biographies/Euler" visual="https://mathshistory.st-andrews.ac.uk/Biographies/Euler">Euler</url> was one of the all-time great
  mathematicians. In any list of stellar mathematicians, he would
  stand out among the best.  Indeed, Pierre-Simon Laplace
  <m>(1749-1827)</m>, an outstanding mathematician in his own right, was
  once asked by a novice how best to learn Calculus. Laplace told him
  <q>Read Euler, read Euler, he is the master of us all.</q>
</p>
</aside>

<p>
  Leonhard Euler (1707<mdash/>1783) solved the differential <xref
  ref="EQUATIONDampedProblem1">equation</xref> by guessing that for some
  carefully chosen value of <m>c</m>
<me>
  y(t)=e^{ct}
</me>
would be a solution. In view of the
results of <xref ref="PROBLEMDampedOscillator1"></xref> this guess looks
completely crazy. Where is the sine? Where is the cosine? Nothing
seems to be oscillating!
</p>
<p>

  It is
  difficult to imagine what might have led him to make such a guess.
  But Euler knew that if his guess didn<rsq/>t pan out he didn<rsq/>t have to tell anyone
  about it. He could just toss all of his notes into his fireplace and
  pretend that he<rsq/>d never made his crazy-seeming guess.
</p>
<p>

  The really crazy thing though, is that Euler<rsq/>s guess worked. Here<rsq/>s
  how.
</p>
<aside>
<title>Pronunciation</title>
<p>
His name is pronounced <q>oiler,</q> not <q>you-ler.</q>
</p>
</aside>

<p>
  The key is the constant <m>c</m>. By leaving it unspecified Euler gave
  himself a little <q>wiggle room.</q> All he had to do now was find a
  value of <m>c</m> that would work.
</p>

<problem>
  <statement>
    <p>
      Show that if <m>y=e^{ct}</m> satisfies the differential equation
      <me>      \dfdxn{y}{t}{2}+\dfdx{y}{t}+y=0</me>
then <m>c</m> must satisfy the quadratic equation
<men  xml:id="EQUATIONImagSolution">

  <!-- \label{eq:ImagSolution} -->
  c^2+c+1=0.

</men>
</p>
</statement>
<hint>
<p>
Put the first two derivatives of <m>y</m>  into the
differential equation.
</p>
</hint>
</problem>
<p>

  Solving  <xref ref="EQUATIONImagSolution">equation</xref> we see that
  <m>
    c=\frac{-1}{2}\pm\frac{\sqrt{-3}}{2},
</m>
so we conclude that if <m>c=-\frac12+\frac{\sqrt{-3}}{2}</m> or
<m>c=-\frac12-\frac{\sqrt{-3}}{2}</m> then <m>y=e^{ct}</m> satisfies
<xref ref="EQUATIONDampedProblem1">equation</xref>.
</p>
<p>

  The appearance of <m>\sqrt{-3}</m> is troubling since there is no real
  number which is the square root of a negative number. But Euler knew
  that such <q>imaginary</q> numbers had been effectively used in the
  previous century, although no one could yet explain what they really
  were. Knowing that if nothing useful came of his efforts
  he could discard them and try something else, Euler decided to
  treat the square roots of negative numbers, like differentials, as
<q>convenient fictions</q>
</p>
<aside>
<title>Historical Background</title>
<p>
Descartes had derided them as <q>imaginary</q> in his book
  <pubtitle>La Geometrie</pubtitle> in 1637 <q>. . . whereas we can always
  imagine as many roots for each equation as I have predicted, there
  is still not always a quantity which corresponds to each root so
  imagined.</q>
</p>
</aside>


<p>
  Since he had assumed that <m>c</m> was a constant Euler
  wanted to see where that assumption would lead. In particular he
  decided to treat <m>\sqrt{-3}</m> as the constant it is.
  To make things <q>easier on the eyes,</q> Euler wrote
  <m>\sqrt{-3} = \sqrt{3}\cdot\sqrt{-1}</m> and set <m>\sqrt{-1}=i</m>.
</p>
<p>

  Euler now had two solutions of <xref ref="EQUATIONDampedProblem1">equation</xref>, one
  for each possible value of <m>c</m>:
  <me>
    y_1(t) =e^{\left(-\frac12+\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}i\right)t} =
    e^{-\frac{t}{2}}\cdot e^{\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}it}
</me>
and
<me>
  y_2(t) =e^{\left(-\frac12-\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}i\right)t}
  =e^{-\frac{t}{2}}\cdot e^{-\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}it},
</me>
but the presence of <m>i=\sqrt{-1}</m> makes it hard to understand what
these solutions could mean.

  To find meaning in his solutions he returned to the simpler

  <me>  m\dfdxn{y}{t}{2}= -ky,</me> which he

  From part (a) of <xref ref="PROBLEMEulersFormula"></xref> we get the

    e^{it}=\cos(t)+ i\sin(t).
<!-- \label{eq:EulerIdentity} -->
</men>
<xref ref="EQUATIONEulerIdentity">equation</xref> is known as <term>Euler<rsq/>s Identity</term> and it
is foundational to electrical engineering, and physics (especially
Quantum Mechanics). For mathematicians it is the key to
understanding the geometry of the <term>Complex Numbers</term> (numbers of
the form <m>a+bi</m>, where <m>a</m> and <m>b</m> are real numbers and <m>i^2=-1</m>.

  For Euler, it was a way to translate trigonometric functions to
  exponential (and hyperbolic trigonometric) functions and back.  For
  us, it is the key to our dampened oscillation problem.

<p>
  Before we get to that, notice the following curious consequences of Euler<rsq/>s
  Identity.

<p>
We call this
  curious because it relates the numbers <m>0, 1, i, e</m> , and <m>\pi</m> all
  in one simple formula. To find out what it actually means you<rsq/>ll
  need to become a mathematics major and take a course in Complex
