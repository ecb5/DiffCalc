You are already familiar with fourteen of the so-called elementary
functions in mathematics. These are:
\begin{enumerate}
\item <term>\underline{Polynomials:</term>} Polynomials are functions of the
  form: $f(x) = c_0+c_1x+c_2x^2+c_3x^3+\ldots+c_{n-1}x^{n-1}+c_nx^n,$
  where $c_0, \ldots, c_n$ are constants.
\item <term>\underline{Rational Functions:</term>} The rational functions
  are quotients of polynomials:
  $$
  \frac{a_0+a_1x+a_2x^2+a_3x^3+\ldots+a_{n-1}x^{n-1}+a_nx^n}{b_0+b_1x+b_2x^2+b_3x^3+\ldots+b_{n-1}x^{m-1}+b_mx^m},
  $$
  where $a_1, \ldots, a_n, b_1, \ldots, b_m$ are constants.
  

\item <term>\underline{Trigonometric Functions:</term>} There are six
  trigonometric functions: $\sin(\theta)$, $\cos(\theta)$,
  $\tan(\theta)$, $\cot(\theta)$, $\sec(\theta)$, and $\csc(\theta).$
\item <term>\underline{Trigonometric Inverses:</term>} Each of the
  trigonometric functions has an associated inverse:
  $\inverse\sin(\theta)$, $ \inverse\cos(\theta)$,
  $\inverse\tan(\theta)$, $ \inverse\cot(\theta)$,
  $\inverse\sec(\theta)$, and $\inverse\csc(\theta).$
\end{enumerate}
Algebraically combining this basic set of fourteen functions allows us
to build almost all of the functions you have encountered so far in
your mathematics education. Loosely speaking what makes these
elementary is that we don't need Calculus to define them.

But Calculus gives us several different ways to define a multitude of
new functions. Each such function is a new tool. New tools give us the
means to solve new problems, and a new way to approach old
problems. This is one reason that the invention of Calculus was such
an important advance.

Functions which require Calculus for their definition are (usually)
called <term>analytic</term> functions\aside{The precise definition
  of <term>analytic</term> actually comes directly from the work we did in
  <xref ref="SECmore-high-deriv">Section</xref> on approximating functions with
  polynomials. But one way or another the definition of
  <term>analytic</term> is tied to Calculus.}.

The exponential and logarithmic functions which we take up next occupy
a middle ground between the elementary and the analytic
functions. They can be defined without Calculus, which is why
you're probably already familiar with them. But in some ways it is
better to use Calculus.  The exponential functions give us our first,
fairly easy-to-understand introduction to the construction of new
functions using Calculus so we will start there.



</introduction>



<subsection xml:id="no-label">
<title>Initial Value Problems (IVPs)</title>

Let's step back for a moment.
Recall that an IVP consists of two parts:
\begin{enumerate}
\item The differential equation (for example, $\dfdx{y}{x}=2x$), and
\item The initial value\aside{It's called an initial value
    because when time is the independent variable we usually know the
    value of our function initially, when $t=0.$} (for example,
  $y(0)=0$).
\end{enumerate}


A common way to create new functions using Calculus is by
defining the new function to be the solution(s) of a specified
IVP.

<example xml:id="no-label">

  
  We've seen that when we differentiate the formula $y=x^2$ we get the
  <term>differential equation</term> $\dx{y} = 2x\dx{x},$ or
  <me>

    \dfdx{y}{x}=2x.\label{eq:x2diffeq}
  
</me>
  If we did not already know that the function $y(x)=x^2$ satisfies
  <xref ref="EQx2diffeq">Equation~</xref>) we could give a name to the solution
  (sqr$(x)$, perhaps?) and by fiat, define sqr$(x)$ to be
  whatever function solves this equation.
  But there is a problem. The solution of <xref ref="EQx2diffeq">Equation~</xref>)
  is a multifunction, remember? To choose a single branch we need to
  impose an initial condition.

<!--   \end{enumerate} -->
<!-- \end{ProficiencyDrill} -->
</example>

Simply naming the function tells us nothing about it. However the IVP
itself can give us a some insight into the nature of the solution.
For example since $2x\lt 0$ when $x\lt 0$, the slope of the graph of
$y(x)$ is clearly also negative when $x\lt 0$, Similarly, the slope
of the graph of $y(x)$ is positive when $x\gt 0$.

Of course we already knew that since we have a formula for
$y(x)=\text{sqr}(x)=x^2$. This won't be true in the next section.

<section xml:id="sec:exponential">
<title>The Natural Exponential</title>

<!-- \label{sec:exponential} -->


\TLogo{PSP:four-proof-irrat}

In exactly the same way that we can define $\text{sqr}(x)$ via any of
the
Initial Value Problems in <xref ref="DRILLIVP-sqr">Drill~\</xref> we can declare, by fiat, the following:\\
\begin{mydefinition}[The Natural Exponential Function]
  \label{def:natural-exponential-ivp}
  The function which satisfies the IVP
  <me>

    \dfdx{y}{x}=y,\ \ y(0)=1.\label{IVP:ExpDiffeq}
  
</me>
        
  
      </me>
  is called the <term>natural exponential function</term>, denoted
  $\exp(x)$.
\end{mydefinition}
But of course as we said earlier, simply giving the function a name
does not tell us anything about it.

In <xref ref="SECeulers-method">Section</xref>
we investigated this IVP in some detail and we were able to draw an
approximate graph of the natural exponential (at least near the
initial value, $\exp(0)$). We will explore this function further here.



Recall that the Taylor Polynomial of a function, as described in
<xref ref="SECmore-high-deriv">Section</xref>, <xref ref="EQTaylorFormula">Equation</xref>,
given by\aside{Recall that the parenthetical superscript, $(n)$, indicates the $n$th
derivative. Thus $y^{(2)}(x)$ represents the second  derivative of
$y(x)$, $y^{(3)}$ represents the  third derivative,  and so on.}
$$
T_n(x)=y(0) +\frac{y^{\prime}(0)}{1!}x
+\frac{y^{(2)}(0)}{2!}x^2+\frac{y^{(3)}(0)}{3!}x^3
+ \cdots +
\frac{y^{(n)}(0)}{n!}x^n,
$$
can approximate the function $y(x)$ well, near a given point. Since we
know the value of the natural exponential at the initial
value letâ€™s try to generate the Taylor Polynomial approximation of
$\exp(x)$ near that point.




Notice that because $\exp(x)$ satisfies <xref ref="IVPExpDiffeq">IVP~</xref>) it
also satisfies each of the following (why?):
\begin{align}
  \nonumber       \exp^{(2)}(x)=\exp^\prime(x)\amp =\exp(x)\\
  \nonumber
  \exp^{(3)}(x)=\exp^{(2)}(x)=\exp^\prime(x)\amp =\exp(x)\\
  \nonumber       \amp \ \ \vdots\\
  \exp^{(n)}(x)=\cdots = \exp^{(2)}(x) =
  \exp^\prime(x)\amp =\exp(x)\label{eq:ExpDerivs}
\end{align}

<problem xml:id="no-label">
<statement>
<p>
  Let $T_n(x)$ be the $n$th degree Taylor polynomial approximation of
  $\exp(x)$ and use <xref ref="EQExpDerivs">Equation~</xref>) and the initial

  $\exp(0)=1$  to show that 
  $$
  \displaystyle T_n(x) =1+x+\frac{x^2}{2!}+\frac{x^3}{3!}
  + \cdots + \frac{x^n}{n!}.
  $$
</p>
</statement>
</problem>


















It is now time to solve <xref ref="IVPExpDiffeq">IVP~</xref>) by finding an
explicit formula for $\exp(x)$.

But how? Nothing really presents itself as a potential solution so
what should we do?  Since we don't seem to have any better options,
let's see if we can guess a solution.

\begin{Digression}[The Art of Guessing Effectively]
  \label{digress:EffectiveGuessing}
  No, really.  Guessing can be surprisingly effective.

  You know this of course. You've been doing it all of your life, but
  in the past -- especially in math classes -- guessing was probably
  discouraged so you tend to deny doing it, possibly even to yourself.
  It's OK. Guess anyway. We won't tell anyone.

  The fact is that guessing is a tried and true solution technique and
  we encourage you to use it regularly.  Guessing is nothing more, or
  less, than relying on your native intuition.

  However, effective guessing is a skill. You need practice to do it
  well and, unfortunately, you have probably not had much chance to
  practice that skill in the context of mathematics.  So we encourage
  you to guess often from now on. But be aware that making a guess is
  a process, not an event. If you guess wrong, which
    is most likely, then you have a new, related problem to think
  about: All of your intuition said this was a good guess.  Why didn't
  it work?  The answer to that question almost always gives some
  insight into the original problem.  Even a bad guess can be useful.

  However a bad guess, indeed
    any guess,  in isolation is a waste of time. You must also take
  the time to figure out why your bad guess doesn't work.

  But the real danger in guessing -- the reason it is usually
  discouraged -- is that when you do guess correctly, or nearly so, it
  is  very tempting to just move on from there. Don't do that.

  Guessing correctly means that your intuition was very good. But
  intuition is unconscious.  It is at least as important to understand
  where a good guess came from, and why it worked as it is to
  understand why a bad guess didn't work.  But when you guess well it
  is extremely tempting to just take your good guess and run with
  it. This will invariably lead to confusion later. So, when you guess
  correctly take a few moments to think about the intuition that led
  you to that guess.  Bring that intuition out of your unconscious
  mind and into your conscious mind.  If you don't do that your
  guesses are a waste of your time. % When you guess well
\end{Digression}

So let's take a guess. There is no need to get really crazy about it
though. We already know that the Taylor polynomial of $\exp(x)$
approximates $\exp(x)$. Maybe we can find an $n$ large enough that the
approximation becomes exact.

<!-- \end{enumerate} -->
<!-- \end{embeddedproblem} -->

Notice that if
$$y= 1+x+\frac{x^2}{2!}+\frac{x^3}{3!} + \ldots +
\frac{x^{999999}}{999999!} +   \frac{x^{1000000}}{1000000!}
$$
then
$$
\dfdx{y}{x} = 1+x+\frac{x^2}{2!}+\frac{x^3}{3!} + \ldots +
\frac{x^{999999}}{999999!},
$$
so that the difference between $y$ and $\dfdx{y}{x}$ is
$$
y-\dfdx{y}{x} = \frac{x^{1000000}}{1000000!}.
$$

Since the difference between $y$ and $\dfdx{y}{x}$ is that stupid
one-millionth term -- which is very small --  it is clear that we've
almost got something here. Surely we can handle that last term somehow!

Sadly no, we can't. In fact no polynomial will solve
<xref ref="IVPExpDiffeq">IVP~</xref>).


<problem xml:id="no-label">
<statement>
<p>
  Show that the previous paragraph is true. That is, show that there
  is no (non-zero) polynomial that solves the differential equation:
  $\dfdx{y}{x}=y.$ \\
  \hint{Consider the degree of the polynomial and the
    degree of its derivative.}
</p>
</statement>
</problem>

Since no polynomial will work a fair question is: Why have we taken
you on this wild goose chase?

In fact, we almost have a solution here. One million is a very
large number, so one million factorial ($1000000!$) is inconceivably
large. Thus for any value of $x$ we're likely to encounter that one
millionth term, $\frac{x^{1000000}}{1000000!},$ is so incredibly close
to zero that it almost isn't really there. And if it isn't really
there then
$$
y= 1+x+\frac{x^2}{2!}+\frac{x^3}{3!} + \ldots +
\frac{x^{999999}}{999999!}  \textcolor{red}{\underbrace{+
    \frac{x^{1000000}}{1000000!}}_{\text{\tiny Not really
      here. Shhh!}}}
$$
and its derivative
$$
\dfdx{y}{x}= 1+x+\frac{x^2}{2!}+\frac{x^3}{3!} + \ldots +
\frac{x^{999999}}{999999!}
$$
 are pretty much the same thing.

So we're .\ .\ . done, .\ .\ . right?

No, of course not. Although that last term really is
practically zero it is not actually zero, no matter how
small it is.  As Newton said, ``In mathematics the
smallest of errors must be dealt with\aside{Newton wrote his
  scientific works in Latin. This is a very loose translation of the
  phrase ``<foreign>In rebus mathematicis erores quam minimi non sunt
    contemnendi.</foreign>'' from his book <pubtitle> Quadraturam Curvarum</pubtitle> (On
  the Quadrature of Curves).}.''

So we haven't solved our problem in the sense of having an explicit
formula for $\exp(x)$. But we do know a great deal about it at this
point. In particular we know that the Taylor polynomial
$ 1+x+\frac{x^2}{2!}+\frac{x^3}{3!} + \ldots +
\frac{x^{999999}}{999999!} + \frac{x^{1000000}}{1000000!}$ will be a
very good approximation of $\exp(x)$, at least for  values
of $x$ near zero.



But if there is no polynomial that solves
<xref ref="IVPExpDiffeq">equation~</xref>) does that mean there is no solution at
all? Certainly not. In fact, since that last term of the polynomial
seems to be the stumbling block the solution is clear: All we need to
do is not have a last term.

This is a startling idea but before we dismiss it, let's take our own
advice from <xref ref="DIGRESSEffectiveGuessing">Digression~\</xref>. We'll trust
our intuition, but also examine it closely. What we're saying is that
the solution of <xref ref="IVPExpDiffeq">Equation~</xref>) is:
<me>

  y= 1+x+\frac{x^2}{2!}+\frac{x^3}{3!} + \cdots\label{eq:ExpSeries1}

</me>
where the dots at the end mean that the summation goes on
forever. There is no last term.

You would expect a polynomial that doesn't end to be called an
infinite polynomial but it is not. Such an expression is called an
<term>infinite series.</term> Usually we  just call it a series. A
series is not a polynomial. That is, a polynomial is
defined to have only finitely many terms and a series is
defined to have infinitely many terms. We distinguish them from
each other
specifically so that we don't confuse a series with a polynomial.

An obvious question to ask is, ``Does this infinite series even mean
anything?'' Or, equivalently, ``What does it mean to add up infinitely
many numbers?''  These are excellent questions which will have to be
addressed eventually. But for now we won't let them trouble us. We'll
just assume that $y=1+x+\frac{x^2}{2!}+\frac{x^3}{3!}+\ldots$ makes
sense, in the same way we assumed that differentials make sense and
defer those questions until later.

We would be remiss if we did not mention that
      we have lead you up to the edge of an abyss here. It is not at
      all clear that the Sum Rule for differentiation can be extended
      to infinite sums in any meaningful manner. In fact, this is a
      very delicate question. Sometimes the extension is valid and
      sometimes it is not. This is another of the foundational
      questions (like ``What is a differential?'') that took
      mathematicians nearly $200$ years to resolve and understanding
      that resolution requires the use of considerably more subtle
      tools than we have at this point. You will learn more about this
      in the next course. For now we will assert the prerogative of
      the teacher and simply tell you that in this case term-by-term
      differentiation still works.

This actually is a correct solution of <xref ref="IVPExpDiffeq">IVP~</xref>), and
eventually you will learn to work with infinite series solutions of
IVPs directly. But, unfortunately, we don't yet have the tools that allow
us to do that. So we will have to find another way.
What now?

At the left is the graph of the polynomial
$y= 1+x+\frac{x^2}{2!}+\frac{x^3}{3!}+ \cdots + \frac{x^{50}}{50!}$
which we believe, from our work in <xref ref="SECmore-high-deriv">Section</xref>,
should be a good approximation to $\exp(x)$, at least when $x$ is near
zero. When we zoom in on the part of the graph which is near $x=0$ we
see that the following
graph should be a reasonable approximation to the solution of
<xref ref="IVPExpDiffeq">IVP</xref> in the interval shown.\\

<image source="images/FiftiethExp.png" width="60%" />
<!-- \centerline{\includegraphics*[height=2in,width=2.5in]{../Figures/FiftiethExp}} -->


In your earlier math courses you may have seen graphs that looked like
this before. If not, then consider the following graphs of the
<term>exponential functions</term>, $y=2^x$ and $y=3^x$\\

<image source="images/2^xAnd3^x.png" width="60%" />
<!-- \centerline{\includegraphics*[height=2in,width=2.5in]{../Figures/2^xAnd3^x}} -->
and notice that they are very similar to the graph of $y=
1+x+\frac{x^2}{2!}+\frac{x^3}{3!}+ \cdots + \frac{x^{50}}{50!}$. This
is much clearer  when we graph all three functions 
on the same axes as seen here:\\

<image source="images/Exp2and3.png" width="60%" />
<!-- \centerline{\includegraphics*[height=2in,width=2.5in]{../Figures/Exp2and3}} -->
As you can plainly see near $x=0$ they are indeed very similar.

Since the polynomial
$y= 1+x+\frac{x^2}{2!}+\frac{x^3}{3!}+ \cdots + \frac{x^{50}}{50!}$ is
an approximation to the solution of <xref ref="IVPExpDiffeq">IVP</xref> it appears
that either of $y(x)=2^x$ or $y(x)=3^x$ might be a viable candidate
for the solution of our IVP.  Is it possible we've
had the solution in our hands all along? Let's differentiate
$y(x)=2^x$ to see if solves <xref ref="IVPExpDiffeq">IVP~</xref>).

If $y(x)=2^x$ then $y(0)=2^0=1$ so the initial condition is
satisfied.

To check the differential equation it is tempting to assume that we
can apply the Power Rule, giving us $\dfdx{(2^x)}{x} = x2^{x-1}$. But
this can't possibly be correct because when $x$ is negative then
$x2^{x-1}$ is also negative. But the slope of $y(x)=2^x$ is positive
everywhere as you can see from its graph.

In fact, none of our differentiation rules will give us the derivative
of $y=2^x.$ So we will have to go back to basics and find
$\dfdx{y}{x}$ from first principles, without using any of our
Differentiation Rules.


Let $y(x)=2^x$ and observe that $\dx{y}$ is the (infinitesimal)
difference between $y(x+\dx{x})$ and\aside{Our notation fails us a bit
  here. Recall that $y(x)$ is a function so $y(x+\dx{x})$ means ``$y$
  evaluated at $x+\dx{x}$.'' This is not multiplication. }
$y(x)$, or
\begin{align*}
  \dx{y}\amp =y(x+\dx{x})-y(x)\\
  \intertext{
  Since $y(x+\dx{x})$ is equal to $2^{x+\dx{x}}$ and $y(x)=2^x$ we
  have,}
  \dx{y} \amp =2^{x+\dx{x}}-2^x.\\
\end{align*}
Thus
<me>

  \dx{y} =2^x(2^{\dx{x}}-1).  \label{eq:2^x}

</me>


We want to form $\dfdx{y}{x}$ so we divide <xref ref="EQ2^x">Equation~</xref>) by
$\dx{x}$, giving
<me>

  \dfdx{y}{x}=\frac{2^x(2^{\dx{x}}-1)}{\dx{x}}.\label{eq:d(2^x)}

</me>
The differential in the exponent is a bit concerning. We will have to
be clever.

We have become comfortable thinking of $\dx{x}$ as infinitely small,
but it should be clear that if we take $\dx{x}$ to be a very
  small, but finite number, say $\dx{x}= 0.0000001,$ we can use
<xref ref="EQd(2^x)">Equation~</xref>) to approximate $\dfdx{y}{x}$ as
accurately as we wish.

Replacing $\dx{x}$ with $0.0000001$ on the right side of
<xref ref="EQd(2^x)">Equation~</xref>) we get
<me>

  \dfdx{y}{x}=\dfdx{(2^x)}{x}\approx
  2^x\left[\frac{(2^{\dx{x}}-1)}{\dx{x}}\right]_{\dx{x}=0.0000001} \approx
  2^x(0.7).\label{eq:Exp2}

</me>

<exercise xml:id="no-label">
<statement>
<p>
  Confirm  <xref ref="EQExp2">Equation</xref>.
</p>
</statement>
</exercise>

This isn't bad for a first try! Do you see that we have almost
satisfied the differential equation? We have
$\dfdx{(2^x)}{x}\approx (0.7)2^x$ when what we need is
$\dfdx{(2^x)}{x}=2^x$.  The constant factor is a bit too small. If it
were $1$ instead of $0.7$ we'd have the solution of
<xref ref="IVPExpDiffeq">IVP~</xref>). This is hopeful.

Performing the same calculation using $y(x)=3^x$ we see that once
again we almost have a solution:
<me>

  \dfdx{y}{x}=\dfdx{(3^x)}{x}\approx
  3^x\left[\frac{(3^{\dx{x}}-1)}{\dx{x}}\right]_{\dx{x}=0.0000001} \approx
  3^x(1.1).
  \label{eq:Exp3}

</me>
The initial condition is still satisfied and once again the differential
equation <xref ref="IVPExpDiffeq">in~</xref>) is {\it almost} satisfied. But this time
the coefficient, $1.1$ is a bit too big.

It stands to reason that there must be some number between $2$ and $3$
with the property that $y=(\text{number})^x$ satisfies
<xref ref="IVPExpDiffeq">IVP~</xref>). For historical reasons this number,
whatever it is, has been named $e$. So the solution of
<xref ref="IVPExpDiffeq">IVP~</xref>) is
$$
\exp(x)=e^x.
$$

The function $y(x)=e^x$ is called the <term>natural exponential</term>
function\aside{You can decide for yourself how natural this really
  is. Opinions vary. But whether you decide you like this name or not
  it is the name everyone uses so we're stuck with it.} and $e$ is its
base just as $2$ is the base of the exponential function $y(x)=2^x$ and
$3$ is the base of the exponential function $y(x)=3^x$.  


Of course, we only know that $2\lt e\lt3$ so far. How might we find a
better approximation to $e$?

<exercise xml:id="drill:ComputingE">
<statement>
<p>
  <!-- \label{drill:ComputingE}  -->
  Since we know that
  $\exp(x)= 1+x+\frac{x^2}{2!}+\frac{x^3}{3!}+ \cdots $
  solves <xref ref="IVPExpDiffeq">IVP</xref>, it should be clear that we can
  approximate $e = e^1$ by computing the sum of, say fifty, terms of
  the series.
  $$ 
  e\approx 1+1+\frac{1^2}{2!}+\frac{1^3}{3!}+ \cdots +
  \frac{1^{50}}{50!}.
  $$
  Compute this approximation using your favorite computing technology
  to confirm  that $e\approx 2.718$.  \\
  \comment{If you don't have any computing technology available just
    compute the sum of the first six terms.}
</p>
</statement>
</exercise>

The upshot of <xref ref="DRILLComputingE">Drill~\</xref> is that if we replace $2$
with $e\approx 2.718$ in <xref ref="EQExp2">Equation</xref>, or if we replace $3$
in <xref ref="EQExp3">Equation</xref> the constant we get should be closer to $1$
than either $0.7$ or $1.1$.

Checking this gives
$$
\dfdx{y}{x}=
e^x\left[\frac{2.718^{\dx{x}}-1}{\dx{x}}\right]_{\dx{x}=0.0000001}\approx
e^x(1.00000004943).
$$

We did not get  exactly $1$ because
\begin{enumerate}
\item We used an approximation of $e$, not $e$ itself, and
\item $0.0000001$ is a very small, finite number, not a
  differential.
\end{enumerate}
But the evidence is compelling that $\exp(x)=e^x$ is the solution of
the <xref ref="IVPExpDiffeq">IVP~</xref>).  Henceforth then, we will reserve the
letter $e$ to designate the base of the natural exponential function.

You might ask, ``Why not just figure out what $e$ actually is, and use
that? Why use the letter $e$?''  The answer is that $e$ is an irrational number
much like $\pi$. Among other things this means that its decimal
expansion never ends, so we use $e$ for the same reason we use $\pi$.

\begin{Digression}[Exponential Notation]
  We originally named this function $\exp(x)$, and this is still a
  valid name for it, just as sqr($x$) is a valid name for the function
  sqr$(x)=x^2$. However, just as the formula $y(x)=x^2$
  better represents the way we usually think about the squaring
  function (``square the input variable''), the notation $y(x)=e^x$
  better represents the way we usually think about the natural
  exponential function.

  You should think of the natural exponential as ``this funny number
  $e$ raised to the power of the input variable.''

  However, it is a curious fact that the modern definition of the
  natural exponential is not $e^x.$ The modern definition is
  actually the infinite series we derived earlier:
  $$e^x=\exp(x)=1+x+\frac{x^2}{2!}+\frac{x^3}{3!}+ \cdots.$$

  To see why this is, ask yourself what the expression $e^{1/2}$
  means.

  That's easy enough. Since $x^{1/2}=\sqrt{x}$ clearly
  $e^{1/2}=\sqrt{e}.$ It would not necessarily be easy to compute the
  square root of $e$ but we're only asking about the meaning of our
  symbols here. Since $e$ is a positive number we can take its square
  root and that is what $\sqrt{e}$ means, even if we can't
  compute it.  In precisely the same way $e^{5/7}=\sqrt[7]{e^5}$,
  $e^{2/3}=\sqrt[3]{e^2}$ and in general if $a$ and $b$ are positive
  integers, $e^{a/b}=\sqrt[b]{e^a}$. 


  But what could the expression $2^e$ possibly mean?  Since $e$ is not
  an integer it doesn't mean ``$e$ copies of $2$ multiplied
  together.''  Since $e$ can't be represented as ratio of integers
  (because it is irrational after all) it doesn't mean some
  root of $2$ raised to a power the way that say, $2^{5/7}$ means
  $\sqrt[7]{2^5}.$ This difficulty is compounded if we ask for the
  meaning of $e^\pi$ or $\pi^e$ since both $e$ and $\pi$ are
  irrational.

  And this is not just a matter of not knowing the value of $e$.  The
  difficulty is built into the real numbers. Recall that we saw the
  same issue come up in <xref ref="SECsome-rules-diff">Section</xref> when we
  tried to extend the Power Rule to irrational exponents.
  This is weird.

  Even if we can't compute it we need to find a way to give
  meaning\aside{Many people are repelled when they encounter this
    situation. Especially in mathematics. After all, mathematics is
    about having the answers to mathematical problems isn't it? \\
    Well,
    no. Actually it isn't. You're thinking of engineering. \\
    Mathematics is about finding the answers to mathematical
    problems, not having them.} to the expression $e^x$ that works when $x$ is
  irrational.  Ideally, we'd like our interpretation to be consistent
  with our understanding that $e^3= e\cdot e\cdot e.$
  
  This is precisely why we define natural exponential as an infinite
  series.    It can be shown that if $m$, and $n$ are integers
  ($n\gt0$)  then
  $$
  \exp(m/n)=\left(\sqrt[n]{e}\right)^m=1+(m/n)+\frac{(m/n)^n}{n!}+\frac{(m/n)^3}{3!}+\frac{(m/n)^4}{4!}+\ldots,\label{eq:ExpSeries4}
  $$


  If there is only one solution to the IVP (there is) then
  $y(x) = e^x$ and $y(x)=1+x+\frac{x^2}{2!}+\frac{x^3}{3!}+\ldots$
  must be the same solution.  Defining $\exp(x)$ as
  <me>

    \exp(x)=1+x+\frac{x^2}{2!}+\frac{x^3}{3!}+\frac{x^4}{4!}+\ldots,\label{eq:ExpSeries3}
  
</me>
  rather than $\exp(x)=e^x$ addresses all of these issues. For example
  $e^\pi$ means
  $$
  e^\pi=
  1+\pi+\frac{\pi^2}{2!}+\frac{\pi^3}{3!}+\frac{\pi^4}{4!}+\ldots.
  $$

  Of course we are still free to think of the natural exponential as
  $e^x$, regardless of the definition and we encourage you to do
  that. It can be very helpful.

We now have a new differentiation rule to remember.  This one is
particularly easy to remember: The natural exponential function
is its own derivative,
$$\dfdx{(e^x)}{x}=e^x.$$
But just because we have a new rule, does not mean that our old
differentiation rules are ignored.  As always, all of the rules work
together.

<example xml:id="no-label">

  Find the derivative of $y=e^{x}\sin(3x).$

  Using the product rule, we have
  \begin{align*}
    \dx{\left(e^{x}\sin(3x)\right)}\amp =e^{x}\dx{(\sin(3x))}
                                     +\sin(3x)\dx{(e^{x})}\\
                                   \amp =e^{x}\cos(3x)\dx{(3x)} +

\subsection*{Hyperbolic Trigonometry: The Hanging Chain}
\label{sec:hyperb-trig-hang}


  We commented in <xref ref="SECbridg-chains-telesc">Section</xref> that Galileo
  believed erroneously that a chain hanging from two pegs falls
  naturally into the shape of a parabola. In
  <xref ref="PICcatenary">Problem~\</xref> we showed that Galileo was wrong but we
  have not
  yet addressed the question: What is the shape of a hanging chain?

  Recall that the hanging chain must satisfy the differential
  equation
  $$
  \dfdxn{y}{x}{2} = \frac{w}{H}\sqrt{1+\left(\dfdx{y}{x}\right)^2}
  $$
  where $w$ is the weight density of the chain and $H$ is the
  (constant) magnitude of the horizontal tension. In
  <xref ref="PROBLEMHangingChain">Problem</xref> we will see that although the
  natural exponential function $y=e^x$ is not the solution itself,
  it is the key to the solution. 
  
\begin{embeddedproblem}[The Shape of a Hanging Chain]  ;;; MULTILEVEL PROBLEM
  <!-- \label{problem:HangingChain} -->
  The Calculus in this problem is pretty straightforward but the
  Algebra gets a bit messy. To avoid some of this mess in parts (a),
  (b), and (c) we will solve the special case where $\frac{w}{H}=1$.
  In part (d) we'll use our solution of this special case to solve
  the original problem.

  So assume that $\frac{w}{H}=1$.  For this special case we will call
  our variables $X$ and $Y$, rather than $x$ and $y$. The reasons for
  this will become clear in part (d).
\begin{enumerate}[label={  (\alph*)}]
  \item     Show that
    $1+\left(\frac{e^X-e^{-X}}{2}\right)^2=\left(\frac{e^X+e^{-X}}{2}\right)^2.$\\
    \hint{It might help to make the substitution $e^X=a$ just to make
      things ``easier on the eyes.'' That makes $e^{-X}=\frac1a.$}
  \item Show that
    $ \dfdx{ \left(\frac{1}{2}(e^X+ e^{-X})\right)}{X}=
    \frac{1}{2}(e^X- e^{-X}) $ and that
    $\dfdx{ \left(\frac{1}{2}(e^X- e^{-X})\right)}{X}=
    \frac{1}{2}(e^X+ e^{-X})$
  \item Show that the curve $Y=\frac12\left(e^X+e^{-X}\right)$
    satisfies differential Equation~(\ref{eq:CatenaryDiffeq}):
    $$
    \dfdxn{Y}{X}{2}=\sqrt{1+\left(\dfdx{Y}{X}\right)^2}
    $$
  \end{enumerate}
    Now let's tackle the original problem.

\begin{enumerate}[start=4,label={  (\alph*)}]
\item  Show that
    <me>

      y=\frac{H}{w}
      \left(\frac{e^{\frac{wx}{H}}+e^{-\frac{wx}{H}}}{2}\right)\label{eq:CatSol}
    
</me>
    satisfies the equation
    $$
    \dfdxn{y}{x}{2}=\frac{w}{H} \sqrt{1+\left(\dfdx{y}{x}\right)^2}
    $$
    where $w$ is the weight density of the chain, and $H$ is the
    constant (magnitude of the) horizontal tension.\\
    \hint{This is essentially the same computation you did for the
      special case, but the Algebra is messier. Consider making
      it ``easier on the eyes'' with the 
      substitutions $$X=\frac{wx}{H} \text{ and }
      Y(X)=\frac12\left(e^X+e^{-X}\right).$$
       We already know from part (c) that
       $\dfdxn{Y}{X}{2}=\sqrt{1+\left(\dfdx{Y}{X}\right)^2}$.
       Notice that $y=\frac{H}{w}Y(X)$ and use this to show that
       $
       \dfdx{y}{x}=\dfdx{Y}{X}\text{ and that }
       \dfdxn{y}{x}{2}=\frac{w}{H}\dfdxn{Y}{X}{2}.
       $
    }
  \item Assume $w=1,$ and $H=1$ and graph the curve given by
    Equation~(\ref{eq:CatSol}).  Does it look like a hanging chain?
    What happens to the graph if we use $w=1, H=2$ or $w=2, H=1.$ Does
    this make sense physically?  Why or why not?\\
  \end{enumerate}
\end{embeddedproblem}

The expressions $\frac12\left(e^x+e^{-x}\right)$ and
$\frac12\left(e^x-e^{-x}\right)$ arise frequently in many scientific
and engineering problems and have been named the <term>hyberbolic
  cosine</term> and <term>hyberbolic sine</term> and are denoted $\cosh(x)$
and\aside{Traditionally, $\sinh$ is read as ``cinch''.}  $\sinh(x)$,
respectively. As you see these names break with the longstanding
mathematical tradition of giving important functions three letter
names. Why do you suppose we would do that?

Recall that the unit circle, $x^2+y^2=1$, is parameterized by
$$
P(t)=
\begin{ParamEq}
{\cos(t)}
{\sin(t)}
{  0\leq t\lt 2\pi}
\end{ParamEq}
$$
since $$ x^2+y^2= \cos^2(t)+\sin^2(t)=1.
$$

<problem xml:id="no-label">
<statement>
<p>
  Analogously, show that the <term>unit hyperbola</term>, $x^2-y^2=1$ is
  parameterized by
  $$
  P(t)=
  \begin{Bmatrix}
    \cosh(t)\\[2mm]
    \sinh(t)\\[1mm]
    {-\infty\lt t\lt \infty}
  \end{Bmatrix}.
  $$
  That is, show that $x^2-y^2=\cosh^2(t)-\sinh^2(t)=1$.
</p>
</statement>
</problem>

The obvious similarity between the formulas
$$
\cos^2(x)+\sin^2(x)=1
\text{ and } \cosh^2(x)-\sinh^2(x)=1
$$
is not a coincidence. It also explains
why they are  called <term>Hyperbolic Trigonometric
Functions</term>.

The many scientific and engineering problems that involve the
hyperbolic functions are slightly outside the scope of this text. So
we will only examine some of their more elementary properties in the

<title>Exponential Growth</title>

<title>Population Growth</title>

  <!-- \label{example:population-growth} -->

  Suppose we start with a colony of $10$ grams of bacteria in a Petri
  dish and we wish to model the growth of the population as a function
  of time. In order to keep our initial discussion simple we begin by
  assuming that $30$\% of our bacteria divide once per day at the same
  time.  Such a population is growing at a rate of $30$\% per day.  If
  we start with $10$ grams of bacteria on day zero, then on day one
  we'll have $30\%$ more, or $13$ grams. On day two we'll have $30\%$
  more than on day one, or $16.9$ grams. It should be clear that the
  rate of growth from day $n$ to day $n+1$ is proportional to how many
  bacteria we have on day $n$. Thus from any one day to the next we
  see that the change in $P$ ($\Delta P$) is given by
  <me>

    \label{eq:DiscBacterModel}
    \Delta P = 0.3 P\Delta t

</me>
  where $\Delta t = 1$ day, and $\Delta P$ is the change in population
  on that day.

  But we assumed that $30$\% of the bacteria were dividing in sync
  once per day, which is unrealistic. To get closer to reality suppose
  next that enough of them divide during any one hour so that at the
  end of one day the population has still grown by $30$\%. Then from
  any one hour to the next we again have
  <xref ref="EQDiscBacterModel">Equation~</xref>) but this time $\Delta t$ is
  equal to one hour, or $\frac{1}{24}$ day.  However, we don't have to
  measure time in days. If we measure it in hours instead we again
  have $\Delta t=1 \text{ hour } = \frac{1}{24} \text{ day}$. The constant factor is still $0.3$ because we assumed that the
  population was growing at $30\%$ per day, and this is still
  true. That factor is called the <term>nominal</term>\aside{The word
    nominal means ``in name or thought'' so this is the named
    growth rate. It is not always the actual growth rate as we will
    see soon.} growth rate.

  If we measure time in seconds the same reasoning will give us
  <xref ref="EQDiscBacterModel">Equation~</xref>), with $\Delta t=1 \text{ second }
  = 1.15741\times 10^{-5} \text{ day}$. If we
  measure in nanoseconds we get <xref ref="EQDiscBacterModel">Equation~</xref>),
  with $\Delta t=1 \text{ nanosecond } = 1.15741\times 10^{-14} \text{ day}$. If we measure time in
  infinitesimal increments we  get
  $$
  \dx{P}=0.3P\dx{t}.
  $$
Notice that we are using the Principle of Local Linearity here. In this
infinitesimal time interval the <term>nominal</term> growth rate, $0.3P $,
is virtually constant and so we are treating it as linear
 growth. 

        

Since we started with $10$ grams of
bacteria we have the initial condition $P(0)=10$. This says that the
amount of bacteria at time $t$ must satisfy the IVP% \aside{Notice that our units are consistent:
<me>

  \dfdx{P}{t}= 0.3P,\ P(0)=10.\label{eq:BacteriaIVP}

</me>

Take specific notice that the differential equation in
<xref ref="EQBacteriaIVP">IVP~</xref>) expresses the idea
that the rate of change of the population, $\dfdx{P}{t}$, is
proportional to the size of the population, $P$. The constant of
proportionality is $0.3$, or $30\%$.


</me>


Clearly there is nothing particularly special about the number $0.3.$
If our colony had been increasing at a <term>nominal</term> rate of $15\%$
we'd have arrived at the IVP:
$$
  \dfdx{P}{t}=0.15P,\ \ P(0)=10.
  $$

</p>
</statement>
</exercise>

From <xref ref="DRILLExpGrowth1">Drill~\</xref> we see that a solution of the
differential equation in our bacterial growth problem,
<xref ref="EQBacteriaIVP">IVP~</xref>), is $\rho(t)= e^{0.3t}$. But $\rho(t)$ does

         \amp = e^0\\
         \amp =1\neq10,
\end{align*}
so $\rho(t)$ can't be the solution of our bacterial growth problem,
<xref ref="EQBacteriaIVP">IVP~</xref>).

We've found that $P(t)= e^{0.3t}$ satisfies the differential equation
but not the initial condition. Can we tweak this so that it

percentage, as we have done here.

The <xref ref="EQExpGen">IVP~</xref>) should look familiar to you.  Notice that when
$r=1$ and $P_0=1$ it is  the same as <xref ref="IVPExpDiffeq">IVP~</xref>) 
$$
    \dfdx{y}{x}=y,\ \ y(0)=1,
$$
which we used to define the the natural exponential. Except, of
course, for the names of the variables. To put it another
way <xref ref="IVPExpDiffeq">IVP~</xref>) is the special case of
<xref ref="EQExpGen">IVP~</xref>) when $r=1.$ Since these are so similar it is not
surprising  that the solution of <xref ref="EQExpGen">IVP~</xref>) 
involves the natural exponential.

<xref ref="PROBLEMExpGrowth2">Problems~\</xref> <xref ref="PROBLEMBacteriaIVP1">and~\</xref>

Part (c) in <xref ref="PROBLEMBacteriaIVP1">Problem~\</xref> indicates that there
are limitations to the usefulness of <xref ref="EQBacteriaIVP">IVP~</xref>) and
its solution, $P(t)=10e^{0.3 t}$. If we use it to 
predict how much bacteria there would be after one year we get
$P(365)=10e^{0.3\times365}\approx3.59\times10^{48}$ grams.  Since
current estimates of the mass of the entire universe are around
$6\times10^{27}$ grams, it is pretty clear that our model doesnâ€™t work
in the long term.

Clearly the bacteria can not sustain a growth rate of $30\%$
indefinitely.  If nothing else, they will eventually run out of
food. Our point here is that this model, like all models, is
limited. To use a mathematical model effectively we need to stay
within its limitations.

But in the short term this is actually a very good model. The picture
at the right shows the surface of Lake Erie during  what is called
an algal bloom. The green discoloration on the western side of the
lake is from an explosive (exponential) growth of algae.  When the
conditions for algae growth are nearly optimum -- if there is abundant
food, there is room for the population to expand into, and the water
temperature is exactly right -- the population of algae in Lake Erie
tracks with our model nearly perfectly\aside{Except that the nominal
  growth rate and the initial condition would need to be adjusted to
  fit the situation.}. The quantity of algae grows exponentially until
the conditions become sub-optimal. Then the population of algae drops
again to normal levels.

An algal bloom can happen in any body of water where algae grow. They
are common in alpine lakes in the early spring when nutrients are
released by the melting snow, but the fish and insects that feed on
the algae have not yet emerged in large numbers.  We will return to
this problem in <xref ref="SECpopulation-dynamics">Section</xref> where we will
tweak this model to extend its usefulness to longer periods of
time. But for now we will continue to use this exponential growth
model with the understanding that for large values of $t$ it is
unreliable.

Speaking loosely, the observation that lead us to <xref ref="EQExpGen">IVP</xref>
is that the number of baby bacteria in a given generation is
proportional to how many parental bacteria were present in the
previous generation. Speaking very loosely, more mamas and
poppas now, means proportionally more babies later. This is all that
is required for exponential growth to occur.

<title>Exponential Functions and Compound Interest</title>


The natural exponential function also arises naturally in financial
mathematics.  If we invest money in a bond which pays a <term>nominal
  interest</term> rate of $5\%$ annually, and the interest is
<term>compounded</term> quarterly then the <term>effective yield</term> will be
$5.09\%$.

There is a lot of financial jargon in the previous paragraph which
makes it hard to understand if we don't speak financial-ese. So we
will take a few pages to learn the vocabulary. After that things will
clear up pretty quickly.


To start, the effective yield represents the actual amount of money
earned at the end of one year -- how much money the investment
actually pays out.  For example, if the investment was not
compounded at all, then at the end of one year, every dollar invested
would yield $\$1.05$ in return, so the effective yield is the same as
the <term>nominal yield</term>: $5$\% annually.


If the investment is compounded semiannually (twice per year), then
half of interest earned is paid out midway through the year.  This
money is then re-invested for the next half year.  This is summarized
in the table below.
\begin{center}
  \begin{tabular}[h]{|c|l|}
    \multicolumn{2}{c}{\textcolor{blue}{$5\%$ nominal interest compounded semiannually}}\\\hline 
    Time $t$ in years \amp Amount investment is worth in
                        dollars\bigstrut \\\hline
    $0$\amp \$1\bigstrut \\
    $1/2$\amp $ \$1+\$1\left(\frac{0.05}{2}\right)=\$1\left(1+\frac{0.05}{2}\right)=\$1.025$\bigstrut \\
            $1$\amp $  \$1\left(1+\frac{0.05}{2}\right)+\$1\left(1+\frac{0.05}{2}\right)\left(\frac{0.05}{2}\right)$\bigstrut \\
    \amp \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ 
    =$\$1\left(1+\frac{0.05}{2}\right)^2=\$1.050625$\bigstrut \\\hline
  \end{tabular}
    \end{center}
The effective yield in this case is approximately $5.06\%$.


                  

The table below shows, in abbreviated form, the computations needed if
the investment is compounded three times in a year.
\begin{center}
    \begin{tabular}[h]{|c|c|}
    \multicolumn{2}{c}{\textcolor{blue}{$5\%$ nominal interest, compounded three times annually}}\\\hline
    Time in years \amp  Amount investment is worth in dollars\bigstrut \\\hline 
    $0$ \amp  $\$1$\bigstrut \\
    $1/3$ \amp  $\$1\left(1+\frac{0.05}{3}\right)^1$\bigstrut\\
    $2/3$ \amp  $\$1\left(1+\frac{0.05}{3}\right)^2$\bigstrut\\
    $1$   \amp  $\$1\left(1+\frac{0.05}{3}\right)^3\approx1.0508$\bigstrut\\\hline
  \end{tabular}
    \end{center}
Quarterly compounding means that the interest is re-invested four
times and is shown in the next table.
\begin{center}
    \begin{tabular}[h]{|c|c|}
    \multicolumn{2}{c}{\textcolor{blue}{$5\%$ nominal interest, compounded $\$1$ quarterly}}\\\hline
    Time in years \amp  Amount investment is worth in dollars\bigstrut \\\hline 
    $0$   \amp  $\$1$\bigstrut \\
    $1/4$ \amp  $\$1\left(1+\frac{0.05}{4}\right)^1$\bigstrut\\
    $1/2$ \amp  $\$1\left(1+\frac{0.05}{4}\right)^2$\bigstrut\\
    $3/4$ \amp  $\$1\left(1+\frac{0.05}{4}\right)^3$\bigstrut\\
    $1$   \amp  $\$1\left(1+\frac{0.05}{4}\right)^4\approx1.0509$\bigstrut\\\hline
  \end{tabular}
    \end{center}
Notice how these three tables differ from and are similar to each
other.  The effective yield comes from the last entry in each table.
 It is the difference between the amount
the investment is worth at the end of the year and what it is worth at
the beginning of the year. So if we compound quarterly the effective
yield is $1.0509-1=0.0509=5.09\%. $

Similarly, if the investment is compounded daily, then the effective
yield is
$\left(1+\frac{0.05}{365}\right)^{365}-1\approx0.0513 = 5.13\%$.  If
we compound $5\%$ nominal interest, $n$ times in a year, then the
return on an investment of one dollar at the end of one year would be
$\left(1+\frac{0.05}{n}\right)^{n}$ dollars, after $2$ years
$\left(1+\frac{0.05}{n}\right)^{2n}$ dollars, after $3$ years
$\left(1+\frac{0.05}{n}\right)^{3n}$ dollars.

In general,, if we let $A(t)$ denote the value of the investment of
one dollar earning $5\%$ annually, compounded $n$ times per year,
after $t$ years, we have
$$
A(t)=\$1\cdot\left(1+\frac{0.05}{n}\right)^{nt},\ t=0,1,2,\ldots
$$

What if the investment was compounded continuously? That is,
suppose the interest is being continuously paid out and simultaneously
reinvested? Obviously, this can't actually be done, but it comes to
the same thing if at the end of the year we get an effective yield
that is equal to the effective yield that would come from continuous
compounding. All we have to do is figure out what this is.

To do this, it will be convenient to write $A(t)$ as
\begin{align*}
  A(t)\amp =\$1\cdot\left(1+\frac{0.05}{n}\right)^{nt}\\
      \amp =\$1\cdot\left(\left(1+\frac{0.05}{n}\right)^{\frac{n}{0.05}}\right)^{0.05t}\\
  \amp =\$1\cdot\left(\left(1+\frac{1}{\frac{n}{0.05}}\right)^{\frac{n}{0.05}}\right)^{0.05t}
  \intertext{ Setting $m=\frac{n}{0.05}$ we see that}
  A(t)\amp =\$1\cdot\left(\left(1+\frac{1}{m}\right)^{m}\right)^{0.05t}.
\end{align*}
We are particularly interested in the quantity
$\left(1+\frac{1}{m}\right)^{m}$ as we compound the interest more
frequently (as $m$ becomes very large).  The following table shows
some values of $\left(1+\frac{1}{m}\right)^m$, for large values of
$m$. Does the numbers in the right colum look familiar to you?

  \begin{center}
    \begin{tabular}[h]{|cc|}\hline
      m \amp  $\left(1+\frac{1}{m}\right)^m$\bigstrut \\\hline
      100  \amp  2.70481382942\bigstrut \\
      1000  \amp  2.71692393224\bigstrut \\
      10000  \amp  2.71814592683\bigstrut \\
      100000  \amp  2.71826823717\bigstrut \\
      1000000  \amp  2.71828046932\bigstrut \\
      10000000  \amp  2.71828169255\bigstrut \\\hline
    \end{tabular}
  \end{center}

  In <xref ref="SECexponential">Section</xref> we saw that $e\approx2.7182$. From
  this table it would appear that $\left(1+\frac{1}{m}\right)^m$
  approaches the number $e$ as $m$ grows larger -- that is, as we
  compound the interest more frequently.  We will show that this is in
  fact the case in <xref ref="SECmore-indet-forms">Section</xref>.

  If this is true (it is) then if we compound the interest
  continuously we have
  <me>

    \label{eq:ContinuouslyCompoundedInterest1}
    A(t)=\$1\cdot\left(e\right)^{0.05t}.
  
</me>
  This equation was derived under
  the assumption that our initial investment was only  $\$1$. In
  general if the
  initial investment is $A_0$  we have 
  <me>

    \label{eq:ContinuouslyCompoundedInterest2}
    A(t)=A_0e^{0.05t}.
  
</me>
  Does this look familiar? 

  <exercise xml:id="no-label">
<statement>
<p>
    The function $A(t)$ has the same form as our solution of
    <xref ref="EQBacteriaIVP">IVP~\</xref> so it must satisfy the differential
    equation: $\dfdx{A}{t}= 0.05A$.
    Confirm that it does. 
  </p>
</statement>
</exercise>

This is interesting. It appears that  <xref ref="EQExpGen">IVP~\</xref> models
continuously compounded investments as well as population growth. Does
this make sense to you?

Think about it for a moment. When money invested the rate of return
(rate of growth) is always proportional to the initial investment, in
the same way that the rate of growth of a population (the rate of
return) is.  Speaking very loosely, the amount of baby dollars in the
next generation will be proportional to the amount
of <url href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlbuGdoAFek" visual="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlbuGdoAFek">mama dollars
  and papa dollars</url> in the current generation in the same way that
the number of baby bacteria in the next generation is proportional to
the number of parent bacteria now.  So it makes sense that
these two very different real world phenomena are modeled by the same
IVP.
 
From the point of view of a banker or a biologist, these are very
different problems so we assign different meanings to the variables
and parameters.  But since relationship between the variables and
parameters is the same whatever we call them, to a mathematician these
are the same problem.



This sort of abstraction is one of the strengths of mathematics. It is
not at all obvious that population growth, investment income, or
nuclear decay (which we will study shortly) are all essentially the
same problem.  It is only when we have abstracted out the critical
features of each that we can see this.

A natural question to ask is, ``How long will it take for my money to
double?'' Would an investment compounding continuously
at a nominal rate of $10\%$ double in half the time as one growing at
a nominal rate of $5$\%. Take a guess and write it down for later
reference. 

To answer this question we'd need solve $ e^{0.05t}=2$, for $t$ and
compare this to the solution of $ e^{0.1t}=2 $.   To
solve either equation we need a way to ``undo'' the natural
exponential function. That is, we need the inverse of the natural
exponential function. This leads us to a discussion of the <term>natural
logarithm</term> function in the next section.

<title>John Napier Logs In</title>

























In the $16$th and $17$th centuries the computational needs of science,
engineering, finance and navigation were growing increasingly complex,
time-consuming, and error prone. The problem of navigating at sea
using only the stars as a guide was particularly vexing.  It became
increasingly important to find very accurate methods of computation
that were also as simple as they could possibly be; that could be
broken down into simple steps that anyone could do without necessarily
understanding the underlying concepts.
The Scottish
mathematician
<url href="https://mathshistory.st-andrews.ac.uk/Biographies/Napier/" visual="https://mathshistory.st-andrews.ac.uk/Biographies/Napier/">John
  Napier</url> ($1550-1617$) invented logarithms specifically to address
this problem.

\begin{wrapfigure}[19]{r}{2in}

  \label{fig:Napier}
  \caption{\centerline{John Napier} \centerline{1555-1617}}
\end{wrapfigure}
Napier described logarithms in
\foreign{\href{https://www.maa.org/press/periodicals/convergence/mathematical-treasure-john-napier-s-mirifici-logarithmorum}{Mirifici
    logarithmorum canonis descriptio}}, published in $1614$, well
before Newton or Leibniz were born so logarithms actually predate the
invention of Calculus by several decades.  He coined the term
``logarithm'' from the Greek words logos meaning ``reasoning,'' or ``
reckoning'' and arithmos meaning ``number.''  To Napier logarithms
were ``reckoning numbers'' which seems an apt description, given their
original purpose.

To see how logarithms work we start with the observation that
$$10^8=(10\cdot10\cdot10)\cdot(10\cdot10\cdot10\cdot10\cdot10)=10^{3+5}.$$
More generally, if $a$ is any positive number and $m$ and $n$ are
any real numbers then
$$
a^{n+m} =a^n\cdot a^m,
$$
The crucial observation here is that exponentiation (raising to a
power) takes the addition of the exponents $n$ and $m$ and
turns it into the multiplication of $a^n$ and $a^m$. Of course,
multiplying instead of adding makes computations more complex, not
less.  This is exactly the reverse of what is needed. What Napier
wanted was a way to turn the complexity of multiplication into the
simplicity of addition. This would make complex computations --
especially computations done by hand with paper and pencil 
(the only kind there was in those days) much simpler.

To turn multiplication into addition all we have to do is read the
equation $a^{n+m} =a^n\cdot a^m$ in the other direction:
$$
a^n\cdot a^m=a^{n+m}.
$$
Now the multiplication of $a^n$ and $a^m$ has become the addition (in
the exponent) of $n$ and $m$. Of course there is much more to be done
to make this a usable computational scheme. But this is the essential
idea. For example if we wanted to use this scheme to multiply
$123.2387\times 43.8378$ we would first need to know that
$123.2387 \approx 10^{2.0907}$ and that $43.8378 \approx
10^{1.6418}$. Adding the exponents gives $3.7325$ so the result of the
multiplication is $10^{3.7325}\approx5401$.  The way to make this a
workable scheme is to compile a large table of numbers and their
associated exponents. This is, essentially, what Napier
did\aside{We're taking liberties with the history here. Napier's
  original scheme was not based on $10^x$.  We explain how Napier
  actually defined his logarithms in
  Digression~\ref{digress:BriggsAndNapier}.  For now it is useful to
  pretend that he used $10^x$. Also, although Napier started compiling
  a table of logarithms, sadly he died before finishing.  It fell to
  his friend and colleague Henry Briggs to complete the task.}

Today we call $2.0907$ and $1.6418$ the \term{base 10}, or
\term{common logarithms}, of $123.2387$ , and $43.8378$,
respectively. Notationally we have
  \begin{align*}
    \log_{10}(123.2387)\amp =2.0907\\
    \log_{10}(43.8378)\amp =1.6418
  \end{align*}
  which is  simply a way to say 
$10^{2.0907} =123.2387$ and $10^{1.6418}=43.8378$ backwards.
  
  In general,
$\log_{10}(10^n)=n$, and we see that the function $\log_{10}()$
simply undoes the function $f(x) = 10^x$, which makes
$\log_{10}()$ the functional inverse of $f(x) = 10^x$, in exactly the
same way that $\inverse\tan(x)$ is the functional inverse of $\tan(x)$
as you recall from Section~(\ref{sec:inverse-tan-and-cot}).


To use a table of base $10$ logarithms to find the product of two
numbers we would first look up the logarithm of each number, then add
the logarithms.  The resulting sum is the base $10$ logarithm of the
product, so we'd look up in our table what this sum is the logarithm
of. The result is the product of the two original numbers. Since the
invention of modern computing technology the original purpose of base
$10$ logarithms -- simplifying numerical computations -- is completely
obsolete. So
\href{https://www.maa.org/press/periodicals/convergence/mathematical-treasure-babbage-s-tables-of-logarithms}{tables
  of base $10$ logarithms are rarely seen in the wild anymore}.
On the other hand the \term{natural exponential} function
$\exp(x)=e^x$ and its functional inverse, the \term{natural logarithm}
are both still quite useful in a variety of contexts, both scientific
and mathematical.

\begin{wrapfigure}[]{r}{2.7in}
\captionsetup{labelformat=empty}
\centerline{\includegraphics*[height=2in,width=2.7in]{../Figures/ExpLog1}}
\label{fig:ExpLog1}
\end{wrapfigure}
The graph of the natural exponential is very similar to the graph of
$y=3^x$. As we saw in 
Section~\ref{sec:inverse-tan-and-cot} if we have the  graph of some
function we can find the graph of its inverse by interchanging the
horizontal and vertical axes. As a practical matter, this is the same
as reflecting the graph across the line, $y=x$. The graph of the
natural exponential and its inverse the natural logarithm are shown in
the diagram at the right.

In the same way that $\log_{10}(x)$ is the functional inverse of the
base ten exponential, $10^x$, the \term{natural logarithm} - usually
denoted  $\ln(x)$ -- is the functional inverse of the
natural exponential, $e^x$.
This inverse relationship allows us to immediately observe two
important properties of the natural logarithm.

    \item $\ln(e^x)=x$.
    \item $e^{\ln(x)}=x$.
    \end{enumerate}
  \end{minipage}
\end{center}

The properties that make the natural logarithm useful as a theoretical
tool are the same properties that made $\log_{10}(x)$ useful as a
computational\aside{In fact if we replace the base $10$ with the base
  $e$ and ``$\ln$'' with ``$\log_{10}$'' all of the properties in this
  list remain true.} tool:

    \item $\ln\left(\frac{a}{b}\right)=\ln(a)-\ln(b).$
    \item $\ln\left(a^b\right)=b\ln(a).$

\begin{Digression}[Exponential and Logarithmic Notation]
  Consider reviewing
  Digression~\#\ref{digression:inverse-function-notation} before
  reading this one. It will probably help.
  
  As we've observed the \term{natural logarithm} function is, by
  definition, the inverse of the \term{natural exponential} in
  precisely the same way that $\inverse\tan(x)$ is, by definition, the
  inverse of $\tan(x)$ .  Unfortunately the notation that is used for
  the \term{natural exponential} and the \term{natural logarithm} is
  not helpful.

  It has become standard practice to notate a function using the first
  three letters of its name. That is why the trigonometric functions
  are denoted $\sin$, $\cos$, $\tan$, $\cot$, $\sec$, and $\csc$. By
  that standard we should properly denote the natural exponential with
  $\exp(x)$. We have used this notation in the past and will continue
  to use it when we want to emphasize the functional nature of the
  natural exponential, but most of the time it is more helpful to
  think of it as the number ``$e$ raised to a power'' and to denote it
  with $e^x$ which, unfortunately, doesn't look like the name of a
  function at all.

  As we saw in Digression~\#\ref{digression:inverse-function-notation}
  before it is also fairly standard practice to denote the inverse of
  a given function with the exponent $-1$.  By that standard we should
  properly denote the natural logarithm by $\inverse\exp$,
  but this is extremely rare.

  By the ``three letter name'' standard the next best name for the
  natural logarithm should be ``$\log(x)$'' but that has been used for
  over $400$ years to denote the base $10$ logarithm.  As a result for
  historical reasons we are stuck with symbol ``$\ln(x)$'' to denote
  the natural logarithm. This notation comes from the initials of the
  Latin name of the function: \foreign{logarithms naturali}. This is
  unfortunate for the student because it adheres to no standard naming
  scheme whatsoever. But once you get used to it, it isn't so bad.

  Sometimes there are reasons to use logarithms with bases other than
  $10$ or $e$. For example, computer scientists frequently use
  logarithms with a base of $2$ which they denote $\text{lb}(x)$
  (binary logarithm).  Even worse, when we talk among ourselves
  mathematicians tend to use the natural logarithm (because for us it
  is the most important), but we often denote it as ``$\log(x)$.''
  When we are talking to scientists and engineers we use whatever is
  appropriate to their discipline. 


  None of this affects what the natural logarithm is, how we use it,
  or how we think about it. Only how we write it. We only bring this
  up to warn you that because of this wide variation in usage
  logarithmic notation can be hard to get comfortable with. Be
  careful. The generic notation is $\log_b(x)$ where $b$ indicates the
  base. In this scheme the natural logarithm is $\log_{e}(x)$, the common
  logarithm is $\log_{10}(x)$, and the binary logarithm is
  $\log_{2}(x)$. If you find yourself getting confused it can help to
  revert to this generic notation.

  It is, after all, just notation. Do not confuse the name of a
  concept with the the concept itself. Conceptually the natural
  logarithm ($\ln(x)$) is the inverse of the natural exponential
  ($e^x$) and you should think of it as such. 

  It is often helpful to think of $\ln(x)$ as the function that peels
  the exponent off of $e^x$ as in Property \#1: $\ln(e^x)=x$.

Take the time to become very comfortable using all of the properties
of logarithms, for exactly the same reason you took time to become
very comfortable with the differentiation rules: Exponential and
logarithmic functions are basic tools in science.

  Like Property \#3, Property \#5 is really just a convenience. Show that it is really
  an immediate consequence of Property \#4 and Property \#6.\\

The simplest use to which we can put a \term{natural logarithm} is to
aid in solving an equation like:
$$
3^x=17.
$$
The difficulty here is that the variable $x$ is in the exponent so to
isolate it we have to ``undo'' an exponential. This is exactly
what logarithms do!  By Property \#6, $\ln(3^x)=x\ln(3)$, so we can
solve our equation like this:
\begin{align*}
  3^x\amp=17\\
  \ln(3^x)\amp = \ln(17)\\
  x\ln(3)\amp= \ln(17)\\
  x\amp=\frac{\ln(17)}{\ln(3)}.
\end{align*}
At this point we can use technology to find that
$\ln(17) \approx 2.8332$ and $\ln(3)\approx1.0986$ so that
$x=\frac{\ln(17)}{\ln(3)}\approx2.5789$.

\begin{ProficiencyDrill-1line}

    \item $2^{x}=3^x$ \solution{$x=0$}
    \item $e^{x-5}=e^5$ \solution{$x=10$}
    \item $7^{x^2-x}=e$

\end{ProficiencyDrill}
Similarly if we needed to solve the equation
  $
   \ln(2x-4)=0
   $
   we would  take advantage of Property~\#2. Taking the exponential
   of both side we see that:
   \begin{align*}
     e^{\ln(2x-4)}\amp =e^{0}\\
     2x-4\amp =1\\
     x\amp =5/2.

Let's return to the question that motivated our look into the

  \begin{enumerate}[label={  (\alph*)}]

When we were modeling exponential population growth, we always stated
the relative growth rate for you, but in real applications this rate
will rarely be known \foreign{a priori}.  Usually we will have to
compute the relative growth rate based on other information from the
problem. For this, logarithms are needed. An example will help to
clarify what we mean.

\begin{myexample}
  Suppose we have a bacteria culture which grows at a rate
  proportional to the amount of bacteria present.  Suppose further
  that it has been observed that we have $2$ grams of the bacteria
  initially, then $24$ hours later we have $3$ grams.  Can we predict
  how much would we have in $48$ hours?

  Let $B(t)$ represent the amount of bacteria present. This time
  our model is
  \begin{align*}
    \dfdx{B}{t}\amp =rB, \text{ (The growth rate is proportional to
    the amount of bacteria present.)} \\
    B(0)\amp =2, \text{ (Initially we have $2$ grams of bacteria.)}\\
    B(24)\amp =3.\text{ (There are $3$ grams of bacteria present
    after $24$ hours.)}
  \end{align*}

  \pagebreak[4]
  \begin{ProficiencyDrill}
    \label{drill:BacteriaGuess1}
    Before we proceed, try to guess how much bacteria we will have
    after $48$ hours.  Will it be $4$ grams?  $6$ grams? More?  Less?
    Write down your best guess. We will revisit this in
    Drill~\#\ref{drill:BacteriaGuess2}, as soon as we have a formula
    for $B(t)$.
  \end{ProficiencyDrill}
  Note that our model is an IVP plus the extra datum: $B(24)=3$. The first
  two pieces of our model, $ \dfdx{B}{t}=rB$, and $ B(0)=2$, define an
  IVP very similar to IVP~(\ref{eq:BacteriaIVP}) which we repeat here
  for convenience:
  $$
  \dfdx{y}{t}= 0.3y,\  y(0)=10.
  $$
  In fact the only difference is that where we had $0.3$ before, we
  now have the unknown parameter, $r$.  In
  Problem~\#\ref{problem:BacteriaIVP1} we saw that
  $ y(t)=10e^{0.3t}, $ so it appears that the solution of the
  problem in this example must be
  $$
  y(t)=2e^{rt}
  $$
  but we don't know the value of $r$.


  To determine $r$, we use the second datum. Since $B(24)=3$ we have
  $
  \frac32=e^{24r}$.
  Had we not taken the trouble to invent the natural logarithm it
  would be very difficult to proceed from this point.  Since we did
  take the trouble, the next step is  straightforward. Taking the
  natural logarithm of both sides, we see that
  $\ln\left(\frac{3}{2}\right)=24r$ or
  $$
  \frac{1}{24}\ln\left(\frac{3}{2}\right)=r.
  $$
  Thus our growth model for this bacterial growth culture is
  $$B(t)=2e^{\left(\frac{1}{24} \ln \frac{3}{2}\right)t}.$$

  Expressing it in this form is cumbersome. It is not wrong, just
  awkward.  We can use the properties of exponents to clean it up at
  bit. This is not strictly necessary, but in general the simpler we
  keep our notation the better.  Using the properties of exponents and
  the mutually inverse nature of the natural exponential and the
  natural logarithm, we have
  $$
  B(t)=2e^{\left(\frac{1}{24} \ln\left(3/2\right)t\right)} =
  2\left(e^{\ln\left(\frac32\right)}\right)^\frac{t}{24}
  =2\left(\frac{3}{2}\right)^{\frac{t}{24}}.
  $$

            So after $48$ hours we have
  $$
  B(48)=2\left(\frac{3}{2}\right)^{48/24}=2\left(\frac{3}{2}\right)^2=2\left(\frac{9}{4}\right)=\frac{9}{2}=4.5
  \text{ grams}.
  $$

    How good was your guess in Drill~\#\ref{drill:BacteriaGuess1}?
    Whether it was good or bad isn't really the point. Either way take
    a moment to hone your guessing skills by considering why you
    guessed the way you did. What was your intuition telling you about
    the problem?
  \end{ProficiencyDrill}
  
  A natural question to ask is, ``How long will it take for the culture
  to reach $4$ grams?''  Translating this into a mathematical question,
  we want to find $t$ when $B(t)=4$, That is, we need to solve
  $$
  4=2\left(\frac{3}{2}\right)^{\frac{t}{24}}
  $$
  for $t.$
  
  \begin{ProficiencyDrill-1line}
    Show that $ t=\frac{24  \ln(2)}{\ln \left(\frac{3}{2}\right)}
    \approx 41.03 \text{ hours.}  $

\subsubsection*{Radioactive Dating}
\label{subsec:radioactive-decay}

Radioactive isotopes have the curious property that in time they break
down into other, more stable, substances. This process is known as
\term{radioactive decay}.
While there is no way to predict when an
individual radioactive atom will decay, the decay of a large
collection of radioactive isotopes is very regular and can be
predicted.

For example, if we have two pounds of the radioactive isotope
Cesium-137 ($\text{Cs}_{137}$) it is known that after the passage of
$30$ years and $70$ days we will have only one pound. The rest will
have decayed into barium.  Even more curious though, is this: If we
wait another $30$ years and $70$ days only one-half pound of the
remaining one pound will have decayed.  The numbers change depending
on the isotope but the general principle is that a fixed percentage of
a radioactive isotope will decay during a fixed interval of time.

Do you see the implications of this? Since a fixed percentage decays
in a fixed time interval the rate of change of $A(t)$ will be
proportional to $A$ itself. Since this is exactly what we said about
both population growth and return on investment,
IVP~(\ref{eq:ExpGen})
should model this phenomenon as well. There is, of course, the
difference that the quantity is now shrinking rather than growing. How
do you think that will manifest in our model? Take a guess.

\begin{myexample}
  \label{example:radioactive-dating}
  For the sake of being definite suppose that our 
  isotope is decaying (shrinking) at a \term{relative}
  (\term{nominal}) rate of  $25\%$. Then if we start
  with $20$Kg, the IVP to be solved is
  <me>

    \label{IVP:RadioactiveDecay-Wrong}
      \dfdx{A}{t}= 0.25A,\ A(0)=20.
  
</me>
  which we recognize as a special case of IVP~(\ref{eq:ExpGen}), so
  the solution will be
$$
    A(t)=20e^{0.25t}
$$

Wait a minute. This can't be right. It says that the number of
isotopes is increasing, not decreasing. Graph it and see.

  So what did we do wrong?

  The derivative of $A(t)$ is its rate of change. If $A(t)$ is
  increasing then its rate of change is going to be positive. If it is
  decreasing then its rate of change will be negative. We seem to have
  committed one of the classic blunders of mathematics. We got the
  sign wrong. We should have been solving  the IVP 
  <me>

    \label{IVP:RadioactiveDecay-Correct}
      \dfdx{A}{t}= -0.25A,\ A(0)=20.
    
</me>
    instead of
    IVP~\#\ref{IVP:RadioactiveDecay-Wrong}. Since IVP~\#\ref{IVP:RadioactiveDecay-Correct}
    also has the same form as IVP\#\ref{eq:ExpGen}),  the correct
    solution is
  <me>

    \label{eq:NuclearDecay-Wrong}
    A(t)=20e^{-0.25t}
  
</me>

  \begin{ProficiencyDrill}
    Graph $A(t)=20e^{-0.25t}$ to confirm that it is decreasing.
  \end{ProficiencyDrill}
  Did you guess correctly that the sign of the exponent would be
  negative in this model?
\end{myexample}


</me>



\begin{myexample}
  Suppose we have $6$ pounds of a very unstable isotope which is known
  to lose half of its mass to radioactive decay in $2$ hours. If we
  let $y(t)$ be the mass of our isotope sample at any time $t$, then
  the IVP we need to solve is\aside{In view of our discussion above
    about positive versus negative rates of change it is tempting to
    write the differential equation as $\dfdx{y}{t}=-ry$. While this
    is not necessarily wrong, it is not helpful. The variable $r$ can
    be any number, positive or negative. If we do our analysis
    correctly the correct value will emerge.}
  $$
  \dfdx{y}{t}=ry,\ \ y(0)=6.
  $$
  As always the solution of a differential equation of this form is
  $$
  y(t) =6e^{rt}
  $$
  where and $r$ is an unknown constant.  To find $r$ we must use the
  additional information given.  Half of our isotope's mass is
  lost in $2$ hours, so $y(2)=3$. Thus
  \begin{align*}
    y(2)=3\amp = 6e^{r(2)}\\
    \frac12\amp = e^{r(2)}\\
    \ln\left(\frac12\right)\amp = \ln\left({e^{2r}}\right)\\
          \amp =              2r\\
    \intertext{or}
    r\amp =\frac12\ln\left(\frac12\right).
  \end{align*}
  Thus
  $$y(t) = 6e^{\frac{t}{2}\ln\left(\frac12\right)}.$$
  This is correct but again it is cumbersome. Also the lack of an
  obvious negative in the exponent is a little troubling.
  
 \begin{ProficiencyDrill-enumerate}
          \begin{enumerate}[label={  (\alph*)}] 
         \item  Use the properties of logarithms and exponentials to show that

           6e^{-\frac{t}{2}\ln\left(2\right)}$.
         \item  Use the properties of logarithms and exponentials  to show that

The length of time that it takes for a quantity of a radioactive
isotope to decay by one-half is called the \term{half-life} of the isotope.
Each substance has its own half-life\aside{In fact, all
  substances have a half-life. But some are more useful than others.}.
The half-life for Carbon-14 is roughly $5,730$ years; for Fluorine-18,
it is $110$ minutes; for Potassium-$40$, it is $1.25$ billion years.

  What are $A(0),$ $A(h),$ $A(2h),$ and $A(3h)?$ Is this consistent
  with calling $h$ the half-life?  Explain.

Radiocarbon $(C_{14})$ is a radioactive isotope of carbon which is
constantly being created in the atmosphere by the interaction of
cosmic rays with atmospheric nitrogen. The resulting radiocarbon
combines with atmospheric oxygen to form radioactive carbon dioxide,
which is incorporated into plants by photosynthesis.
Animals then acquire $C_{14}$ by eating the plants. When the animal or
plant dies, it stops absorbing carbon from the environment. From
that point onward the amount of $C_{14}$ it contains begins to
decrease as the $C_{14}$ undergoes radioactive decay. During life the
ratio of $C_{14}$ to other, stable, isotopes remains stable. However
after an organism dies this ratio begins to decrease due to the decay
of $C_{14}$

By measuring the amount of $C_{14}$ in a sample from a dead plant or
animal such as a piece of wood or a fragment of bone we can calculate,
approximately when the plant or animal died. This is called
\term{radiocarbon dating}, and it was developed
by
\href{https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/chemistry/1960/libby/biographical/}{Willard
  Libby} ($1908-1980$) in $1949$. Radiocarbon dating revolutionized
the field of archaeology.  Libby was awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry
in $1960$ for this development.

  this problem we will recreate the computations done to determine the
  age of the Shroud.

  Let $A=A(t)$ be the amount of $C_{14}$ (in mg) at time $t$ years,

\begin{embeddedproblem} 
  The radioactive isotope Potassium-$40$ $(K_{40})$ has a half life of

  especially effective for dating very old volcanic rock as the
  quickly cooling lava traps the Argon formed by the decaying of
  $K_{40}.$

  This has been used by scientists to study the frequency of
  geomagnetic reversals.  A geomagnetic reversal is a change in the
  earth's magnetic polarity where the magnetic north and south poles
  (not to be confused with the geographic north and south poles) are
  switched.  Basically, the magnetic polarity of the planet is
  ``recorded'' in cooled lava flows.  By dating the age of the
  lava flows, scientists can date these reversals.

 \subsubsection*{\underline{Chillin' with Newton: The Law of Cooling}}
\label{subsec:newtons-law-cooling}
\begin{myexample} 
  Suppose a container of water at a temperature of $40^\circ F$ is
  placed into a freezer maintained at a constant temperature of 
  $5^\circ F.$ We'd like to have a model that will allow us to
  compute how long it will take for the water to cool down to a
  temperature of, for example, $32^\circ F$ where it will start to
  freeze.

  In the late $17$th century Isaac Newton showed experimentally that
  the rate at which the water cools will be proportional to the
  difference between its current temperature and the ambient
  (surrounding) temperature. This is known as Newton's Law of Cooling
  and it holds generally, not just for water.

  For this problem we see that the ambient temperature is $5^\circ F$
  and the initial temperature of the water is $40^\circ F$.  We let
  $T(t)$ represent the temperature of the water at any given
  time. Then the difference between the current temperature and the
  ambient temperature
  is $ T-5$, and (as always) the rate of change of the temperature of
  the water with respect to time is $\dfdx{T}{t}$, (or $\dot{T}$ if
  you are Newton). Letting $r$ be the (unknown) constant of
  proportionality we have the IVP
  $$
  \dfdx{T}{t}=r(T-5),\ \ T(0)=40.
  $$

  This differential equation looks like it will be tougher to solve
  than the IVPs we dealt with earlier. But in fact we can make this
  problem ``easier on the eyes'' with the substitution $D=T-5$.
  Notice that $\dfdx{D}{t}=\dfdx{(T-5)}{t}=\dfdx{T}{t}$ so we have the
  IVP
  <me>

  \dfdx{D}{t}=rD\ \ D(0)=40-5=35.\label{eq:CoolingIVP1}
  
</me>
  Do you recognize this equation? This has the same form as
  IVP~\ref{eq:BacteriaIVP} so the solution is
  $$
  D(t)=D(0) e^{rt}=35e^{rt}.
  $$
Reversing the substitution we see that
\begin{align*}
  T(t)-5\amp =\left(T(0)-5\right)e^{rt}\\
  T(t)\amp =5+35e^{rt}.
\end{align*}
  


To complete our model we need to determine $r$. We can find $r$ if
we know the temperature of the water at a second time during the
cooling.  Assume that we measured the temperature of the water after
$10$ minutes and it was $35^\circ F.$ Thus we have
  \begin{align*}
    35=T(10)\amp =5+35e^{10r}\\
    \intertext{so that}
    \frac{30}{35}\amp =e^{10r} \\
    r\amp =\frac{\ln(6/7)}{10}
  \end{align*}
and our complete model is 
\begin{align*}
  T(t)\amp =5+35e^{\frac{\ln(6/7)}{10} t}\\
      \amp =5+35\left(\frac{6}{7}\right)^{\frac{t}{10}}.
\end{align*}

  Newton's Law of Cooling accurately models the cooling of any object
  placed in  cooler surroundings. We used water in our example just to
  be definite.

  \begin{ProficiencyDrill-1line}
    Since the temperature of the water is decreasing we would expect
    $r$ to be less than zero. Show that it is.
  \end{ProficiencyDrill-1line}

\begin{embeddedproblem-enumerate} 
  \begin{enumerate}[label={  (\alph*)}] 
  \item Answer the original question: How long does it take for the
    water to cool from $40^\circ F$ to $32^\circ F$
  \item Take a guess: Would it take the same amount of time to cool another
    $8^\circ F$ from $32^\circ F$ to $24^\circ F?$ Check to see if
    your guess was correct.
  \item What would the initial temperature of the water need to be to
    take twice as long to cool to $32^\circ F$ as it did for the
    $40^\circ F$ water?
  \end{enumerate}
\end{embeddedproblem-enumerate} 


\begin{embeddedproblem} 
  The forensic rule of thumb for determining the time of death of a
  person is to start with a body temperature of $37^\circ C$
  and\aside{Notice that we've switched to measuring temperature in
    degrees Celsius.}
  subtract $1.5^\circ C$ for each hour the person is dead.  Of course,
  this simple linear model isn't as accurate as Newton's Law of
  Cooling since it does not
  take into account the surrounding temperature, size of the body,
  etc. and can only be applied until the temperature of the body
  reaches the surrounding temperature.
  \begin{enumerate}[label={  (\alph*)}] 
  \item Suppose the ambient temperature is $20^\circ C.$ Using the
    forensic rule of thumb, how long would it take for the body to
    reach the ambient temperature?  Using the forensic rule of thumb,
    what would the body temperature be halfway through the cooling
    process.
  \item Use the temperature predicted by the rule of thumb at the
    halfway point to give a complete model of the body's cooling as
    predicted by Newton's Law of Cooling.  
  \item Of course, in Newton's Law of Cooling, the body temperature
    will never quite reach the ambient temperature, but just for
    comparison, substitute the time when the rule of thumb predicts
    that the body temperature is $20^\circ C$ and see how close it is
    to the ambient temperature.
  \item Using the answer you obtained in part (c), find the rate of
    change of the body temperature at the beginning of the time
    interval and the rate of change of the body temperature at the end
    of the time interval.  How do these compare with the rule of thumb
    rate of change?
  \end{enumerate}
\end{embeddedproblem}

Of course, Newton's Law of Cooling can be used just as well to model
an object heating.  Consider the following:

\begin{embeddedproblem} 
  A whole turkey is considered to be safely cooked when the internal
  temperature is $165^\circ F.$ Suppose a turkey is taken out of a
  refrigerator set at $35^\circ F$ and is put directly into an oven
  set at $325^\circ F$.  You check it $2$ hours later and the internal
  temperature is $100^\circ F.  $ How much longer does the turkey need
  to cook?
\end{embeddedproblem}

\section{The Derivative of the Natural Logarithm}

Since the \term{natural logarithm} is the inverse of the \term{natural
  exponential} we can find its derivative using the same trick that we
used to find the derivatives of the inverse trig functions.  Start
with the identity
\begin{align}
  e^{\ln(x)}\amp =x\ \text{ (Property 1)}\label{eq:UseProp1}\\
  \intertext{and  make this easier on our eyes with the substitution
\nonumber   $y=\ln(x).$ Differentiating Equation~(\ref{eq:UseProp1})
  we see that}
\nonumber  e^y\dx{y} \amp = \dx{x}.\\
  \intertext{Thus}
\nonumber  \dx{y}\amp =\frac{1}{e^y}\dx{x}.\\
  \intertext{Once more making the  substitution $y=\ln(x)$  we have}
\nonumber  \dx{y}\amp =\frac{1}{e^{\ln(x)}}\dx{x},\\
  \intertext{ and since $e^{\ln(x)}=x$ we have}
\nonumber  \dx{y}\amp =\frac{1}{x}\dx{x}.\\
  \nonumber  \dx{y}\amp =\frac{1}{x}\dx{x}\\
             \dx{(\ln(x))} \amp =x^{-1} \dx{x}.\label{eq:NatLogDeriv1}
\end{align}
Equation~(\ref{eq:NatLogDeriv1} is the last differentiation rule you
need to memorize. Memorize it.

As always the difficulty here is not remembering what the
differentiation rule is, the difficulty is in learning to use it in
tandem with all of the other rules. So practice is required. Lots of
practice.

\begin{Digression}[A Curious Fact]
  Observe that if $y=x^\alpha,$ then
  $\dfdx{y}{x}=\alpha x^{\alpha-1}.$ This is, of course, just the
  Power Rule but we take particular notice of the fact that the Power
  Rule guarantees that the derivative of any monomial $(x^\alpha)$ is
  another monomial. But what happens if we try to go the other
  direction?

  If $\dfdx{y}{x}=x^2$ then clearly\aside{Actually, this should be
    $y=\frac{x^3}{3}$ plus an arbitrary constant. Do you see
    why? Since the constant is of no importance to our current point,
    we ignore it. } $y=\frac{x^3}{3}$. In general if
  $$\dfdx{y}{x}=x^\alpha$$ then $$y= \frac{x^{\alpha+1}}{\alpha+1}
 \text{ for }
  \alpha\ne -1.$$ But if $\alpha=-1$ running the Power Rule backwards
  would give us $y= \frac{x^{-1+1}}{-1+1}$ which is meaningless since
  the denominator is $-1+1=0.$ When $\alpha=-1$ we get
  is $y=\ln(x).$

  It seems very strange that there would be this one, single exception
  doesn't it?  Or, to come at the question a little differently, maybe
  this says that the logarithm function is somehow related to
  polynomials? What do you think?

\section{General Logarithms and Exponentials}
\label{sec:gener-logar-expon}
\markright{\sc General Logarithms and Exponentials}
\mycenterquote{You have no idea how much poetry there is in the
calculation of a table of
logarithms!}{\href{https://mathshistory.st-andrews.ac.uk/Biographies/Gauss/}{Carl
Friederich Gauss} (1777-1855)}{.85}

So far we've focused on the \term{natural} exponential and logarithm
functions even though we started our discussion of logarithms by 
defining $\log_{10}(x)$ as the inverse of the base-$10$ exponential:
$10^x$.

But we've seen that  $2^x$ is also an exponential, and it's  inverse
is $\log_2(x)$. In fact, we've seen that for any
$a\gt 0$, $a\neq1$, $a^x$ is the ``base $a$'' exponential and the
corresponding inverse function is called the ``base $a$'' logarithm,
and is denoted $\log_a(x)$.

\begin{ProficiencyDrill-1line}
  Why do we impose the conditions, $a\gt 0$ and $a\neq1$?
\end{ProficiencyDrill-1line}


  Calculus is not needed for the next problem which establishes that all
  logarithm functions change multiplication into addition (Property 4)
  and exponentiation into multiplication (Property 6) as we stated
  (but didn't prove) earlier.

\begin{embeddedproblem} 
  Let $a\gt 0$, $a\neq1$, $x\gt 0,$ $y\gt 0$ and let $c$ be any real number.
  \begin{enumerate}[label={  (\alph*)}]
  \item Show that $\log_a(xy)=\log_a(x)+\log_a(y).$ \\
    \hint{Consider
      $a^{\log_a(x)+\log_a(y)}$ and use the properties of exponents to
      show that this equals $xy.$}
  \item Show that $\log_a(x^c) =c \log_a(x).$ \\
    \hint{Consider $a^{c\log_a(x)}$ and use the properties of exponents
        to show that this equals $x^c$.}
    \end{enumerate}
  \end{embeddedproblem}
  But if there are so many different exponential and logarithm
  functions, don't we need differentiation rules for all of them? If
  so, what are the derivatives of the other exponentials and
  logarithms?

\subsubsection*{General Exponentials}
It is not as hard to differentiate $y=a^x$ as you might think. Since
we already know how to differentiate the natural exponential
all we have to do is re-express $y=a^x$ in terms of $e^x$.

Here's how to do that. Recall that from the inverse relationship
between the natural exponential and the natural logarithm (Properties
1 and 2) $a=e^{\ln(a)}$. So we make that
substitution\aside{Some may see this step as  making $a^x$ ``harder
  on the eyes.'' But often it is often necessary to temporarily make
  things more complicated so that we can recognize a pattern or to
  reduce the situation to a previously solved problem. } to
get
$$
y=a^x=\left(e^{\ln(a)}\right)^x=e^{x\ln(a)}
$$

Now differentiate:
\begin{align*}
  a^x\amp =e^{x\ln(a)}\\
  \dx(a^x) \amp = \dx{\left(e^{x\ln(a)}\right)}= e^{x\ln(a)}\dx(x\ln(a)).\\
\end{align*}
Since $a$ is a constant, $\ln(a)$ is also a constant so
$$
\dx(a^x) = e^{x\ln(a)}\ln(a)\dx{x},
$$
and since $a^x=e^{x\ln(a)}$ we have
$$
\dx(a^x) = a^x\ln(a)\dx{x}.
$$
Many people simply memorize this formula and you are welcome to do
that if you like. However we (the authors) prefer to emulate nature
and be lazy. We find it much simpler to find the derivative of
$a^x$ by rewriting it as $e^{x\ln(a)}$ first.

The following problem shows an alternative (and equivalent) method if
you can't remember how to rewrite $a^x$.

\begin{embeddedproblem}
  Starting with $y=a^x$, take the natural logarithm of both sides and
  solve for $\dx{y}$ to obtain the same formula as above.
\end{embeddedproblem}
Taking a logarithm of complicated formulas sometimes allows us to
simplify things considerably via the properties of logarithms. It is a
nice trick. Keep it in mind. We'll be using it later.

\begin{ProficiencyDrill}
  Find $\dx{y}$ and $\dfdx{y}{x}$ for each of the following:
  \begin{enumerate}[label={  (\alph*)}]
    \begin{multicols}{3}
    \item $y=2^x$
    \item $y=3^x\cdot3^x$
    \item $y=x3^x$
    \item $y=3\cdot7^x+7\cdot3^x$
    \item $y=e^{5^x}$
    \item $y=\ln\left(2^x\right)$
    \item $y=2^x\cdot 3^x$
    \item $y=\frac{2^x}{3^x}$
    \item $y=2^x\cdot4^x\cdot8^{x^2}$
    \end{multicols}
  \end{enumerate}
\end{ProficiencyDrill}

\subsubsection*{General Logarithms}
Just as we computed the derivative of the general exponential, $a^x$
by re-expressing it as a natural exponential, we will compute the
derivative of the general logarithm, $\log_a(x)$, by re-expressing it
as a natural logarithm. This is a bit more difficult, but only a bit.

We begin with the exponential. If $y=\log_a(x)$ then
$ a^y=x$. Taking the natural logarithm of both
sides of $ a^y=x$ and using Property 6 we have, $ y\ln(a)=\ln(x)$,  or
$y=\frac{\ln(x)}{\ln(a)}$.
Since $y=\log_a(x)$ we have successfully re-expressed the
base-$a$ logarithm as a natural logarithm:
<me>

\log_a(x)=\frac{\ln(x)}{\ln(a)}.\label{eq:GenLogConversion}

</me>
This is why many scientific calculators don't bother including a
$\log_a(x)$ button.

  An easy mnemonic for remembering this formula is to simply notice that
  on both sides of the equation the $a$ appears lower than the $x$.

  Since $\ln(a)$ is a constant (why?) we have
$$
\dx{(\log_a(x))}=\frac{1}{\ln(a)}\cdot\dx\left(\ln(x)\right)=\frac{1}{\ln(a)}\cdot\frac1x\dx{x}.
$$
So we have the differentiation formula:
$$
  \dfdx{(\log_a(x))}{x}=\frac{1}{x\ln(a)}.
  $$
  
As with the differentiation formula for  general exponential functions
we (the authors) find it easier to remember this conversion than the
differentiation formula. But you are welcome to memorize it if you
prefer.

\begin{Digression}[Common and Napierian Logarithms]
  \label{digress:BriggsAndNapier}
  It is a well worn truism among research mathematicians that the
  first solution of a substantial problem is frequently both very hard
  to understand and very hard to convey to others, even to other
  mathematicians. We publish our solutions, in part, so that others can
  look at the problem, consider the approach used,  and find simplifications that the original
  investigator missed.

  This is what happened to Napier. Although his original scheme
  allowed him to convert multiplication to addition it was more
  complicated than necessary.  Shortly after Napier published his work
  in
  $1614$,
  \href{https://mathshistory.st-andrews.ac.uk/Biographies/Briggs/}{Henry
    Briggs} ($1561 - 1630$), Professor of Geometry at Gresham College
  in London, visited Napier and suggested that a few simple changes to
  his logarithm table would make it more practical. In particular it
  was Briggs who suggested that since our number system is in
  base-$10$, creating a table of base-$10$ logarithms might be more
  useful.

  Napier had had the same idea himself, but was unable to pursue it
  ``on account of ill-health.'' As a result, Briggs took on the task
  of computing tables of base-$10$ logarithms, collaborating with
  Napier until the latter's death two years later. The results of
  their collaboration are known as the Briggsian or \term{Common
    Logarithms}. Common Logarithms are the base $10$ logarithms we
  discussed earlier and were an important computational aid for nearly
  $400$ years until the invention of modern computational
  technologies.

  As the mathematical historian Howard Eves put it, the invention of
  (common) logarithms literally ``doubled the life of the
  astronomer,'' because they so drastically reduced the time spent
  doing arithmetic.




Most modern scientific calculators have both the natural and the
common logarithms built in.  The ``\term{ln}'' button on a calculator
computes natural logarithms while the ``\term{log}'' computes common
logarithms.

\begin{ProficiencyDrill-enumerate}
  \begin{enumerate}[label={  (\alph*)}]
  \item Use whatever technology you prefer to compute the natural
    logarithms of the numbers $21.2343$ and $5689.121343$ and their
    product. Confirm that
    $\ln(21.2343) + \ln(5689.121343) =
    \ln(21.2343\times5689.121343)$. \\
    \comment{If you don't like these
      numbers use others. We just picked these at random.}
  \item Do the same using common logarithms.
  \item Do the same using $\log_5(x)$. \\
    \comment{Or any other
      base. Again we just picked $5$ at random.}
  \end{enumerate}
\end{ProficiencyDrill-enumerate}


\begin{myexample}
  A calculator is a useful tool, but only if the human operating it
  understands what to calculate, and why. Blind computation is
  pointless and wasteful. As powerful and convenient as our modern
  technology is, there is still no substitution for a deep
  understanding of basic principles.

  For example, how many base-$10$ digits long do you suppose the
  number $2^{1234567890}$ is? You cannot solve this by punching
  $2^{1234567890}$ into a calculator and counting the digits. Try it
  and see.  If you can solve this by punching $2^{1234567890}$ into a
  calculator, that just means that technology has outpaced this
  particular problem. In that case use a bigger exponent, say $12345678901234567890$.

  This feels like the sort of problem a math professor might make up
  just for fun (though it often feels like we do it just to torment
  our students), but it is not. Computer programmers
  routinely have to allocate space in memory to hold information. If
  the information being held happens to be the number $2^{1234567890}$
  the programmer will need to know how much space to allocate to hold
  the number.

      
  \begin{ProficiencyDrill}
    Show that if $n$ is a positive integer and
    $10^n\le\alpha\lt 10^{n+1}$ then $\alpha$ will have $n+1$ digits to
    the left of the decimal point. \\
    \hint{This is true because our
      number system is based on ``powers of ten.'' That is, it is
      based on the base $10$ exponential.}
  \end{ProficiencyDrill}


  Suppose we let $\alpha = 2^{1234567890}$ and take the base $10$ logarithm
  (common logarithm) of both sides. This gives:
  $$
  \log_{10}(\alpha)= \log_{10}(2^{1234567890})=1234567890\cdot
  \log_{10}(2)\approx371641966.574.
  $$
  Thus
  \begin{align*}
    2^{1234567890}=\alpha\amp\approx 10^{371641966.574}\\
    \amp\approx 10^{0.574}\times10^{371641966}\\
    \amp\approx 3.75      \times10^{371641966}.
  \end{align*}
  Since $10^{371641966}\le 2^{1234567890}\le 10^{371641967}$ our
  number, $\alpha$, is $371641967$ base-$10$ digits long.  But since
  computer arithmetic is binary (base-$2$) what we really need to know
  how many binary digits (bits) are needed to store a given number.

  \item Find the number of base-$9 $ digits needed to store the
    number.
  \end{enumerate}
\end{embeddedproblem}

The discussion above suggests the question: What base did Napier use
when he first invented logarithms, before Briggs suggested using base-$10$?

Napier defined his original logarithms as follows.  Consider a point
$C$ moving along line segment $AB$ and a point $F$ moving along an
infinite ray $DE$ as seen below.\\
\centerline{\includegraphics*[height=.5in,width=1.5in]{../Figures/NapierLog1}}
At the beginnning both $C$ and $F$ are moving at the same speed, and
$F$ continues to move at that initial speed. But the speed of $C$ is
always equal to the distance from $C$ to $B$.  If we let $CB=x$ and
$DF=y$, then we define the \term{Naperian Logarithm} as
$$
y = \text{Nap log}(x).
$$

Since Calculus hadn't been invented yet, Napier used Trigonometry to
develop his table of logarithms. The details of those computations are
not relevant for us, except that he took the length of $AB$ to be
$10^7$, because the best sine tables at the time were to accurate to
seven decimal places.



  It is not altogether clear from the description above that the
  Napierian logarithm actually is a logarithm, let alone what its base
  is. The next  problem explores both of these questions.

  \begin{embeddedproblem}
  \label{pic:NapierianLog}
  In this problem we have suppressed the variable $t$.
  \begin{enumerate}[label={  (\alph*)}]
  \item Show that $\dfdx{y}{t}=10^7$, and $y(0)=0$.
  \item Solve the IVP: $\dfdx{x}{t}=-x$, $x(0)=10^7$,
  \item Use the information in parts (a) and (b) to show that
    $$
    \text{Nap
      log}(x)=y(x)=10^7\log_{\frac{1}{e}}\left(\frac{x}{10^7}\right).
    $$
    Thus the base of Napier's original logarithm was $\frac1e$.
  \end{enumerate}
\end{embeddedproblem}



\end{Digression}

\subsubsection*{Logarithmic Differentiation}
Recall that in Section~\ref{sec:some-rules-diff} we observed that the
Power Rule does not easily extend to $y=x^\alpha$, where $\alpha$ is
an irrational number. The properties of the natural exponential and
the natural logarithm functions will (finally) allow us to make this
extension.

Suppose $\alpha$ is any real number\aside{In particular we do not
  assume that $\alpha$ is rational.}.  Starting with $y=x^\alpha$ we
take the logarithm of both sides, obtaining
$$
\ln(y)=\alpha\ln(x).
$$
Differentiating gives
$$
\frac1y\dx{y}=\alpha\frac1x\dx{x}.
$$
Solving for $x$ we see that
<me>

  \label{eq:GeneralPowerRule}
  \dfdx{y}{x}=\frac{\alpha y}{x}=\frac{\alpha
    x^\alpha}{x}=\alpha x^{\alpha-1}

</me>
which  is the Power Rule. Since we did not constraint $\alpha$ except
to say that it is a real number the different versions of the Power Rule
that we saw in Section~\ref{sec:some-rules-diff} are all special
cases of Equation~(\ref{eq:GeneralPowerRule}).

The same trick we just used can make some differentiations much easier
to do.

\begin{myexample}
  For example, suppose we need to differentiate
  $$
  y=\frac{\sqrt{x^3+2x}\cdot \tan(x)}{(x^5-7)^4}.
  $$

  While we can do this using our Differentiation Rules, it will be
  very tedious.  But nice things happen if we take the natural
  logarithm of both sides before we differentiate.
  \begin{align*}
    \ln(y)\amp =\ln\left(\frac{\sqrt{x^3+2x}\cdot \tan(x)}{(x^5-7)^4} \right)\\
            \intertext{Since the natural  logarithm changes division
        into subtraction (Property 5) we
        can rewrite the right side as:}
      \amp =\ln\left[\sqrt{x^3+2x}\cdot\tan(x)\right] -
        \ln\left(\left(x^5-7\right)^4\right).
        \intertext{And since the  natural  logarithm changes
        multiplication    into addition (Property 4) we can
        re-express  the right side again. This time as:}
      \amp =\ln\left(\sqrt{x^3+2x}\right)+ \ln\left(\tan(x)\right) -
        \ln\left(\left(x^5-7\right)^4\right).
        \intertext{Re-expressing the square root as an exponent
        gives}
      \amp =\ln\left(x^3+2x\right)^{1/2}+ \ln\left(\tan(x)\right) -
        \ln\left(\left(x^5-7\right)^4\right).
        \intertext{and we can now bring the exponents down
        in front (Property 6). } 
        \ln(y)    \amp =\frac{1}{2}  \ln(x^3+2x)+\ln(\tan(x)) -4 \ln(x^5-7)).
  \end{align*}
  Notice that we have not yet started differentiating. All we've done
  so far is re-express our function using the properties of
  logarithms.

  But differentiating is now relatively easy.
  \begin{align*}
    \dx{(\ln(y))}\amp =
                   \frac{1}{2(x^3+2x)}\dx{(x^3+2x)}+\frac{1}{\tan(x)}\dx{(\tan{x})}-\frac{4}{x^5-7}\dx{(x^5-7)}\\
    \frac{\dx{y}}{y}\amp =
                      \frac{1}{2(x^3+2x)}(3x^2+2)\dx{x}+\frac{1}{\tan(x)}\sec^2(x)\dx{x}-\frac{4}{x^5-7}(5x^4)\dx{x}\\
  \end{align*}
  If we multiply by $y$ we get
  \begin{align*}
    \dx{y}\amp =
            y\left[\frac{(3x^2+2)}{2(x^3+2x)}\dx{x}+\frac{\sec^2(x)}{\tan(x)}\dx{x}-4\left(\frac{5x^4}{x^5-7}\right)\dx{x}\right]\\
          \amp =        \left[\frac{\sqrt{x^3+2x}\cdot \tan(x)}{(x^5-7)^4}\right]\cdot\left[\frac{(3x^2+2)}{2(x^3+2x)}\dx{x}+\frac{\sec^2(x)}{\tan(x)}\dx{x}-4\left(\frac{5x^4}{x^5-7}\right)\dx{x}\right]\\
  \end{align*}
\end{myexample}

This looks like a lot of work when it's laid out on the page but it
really isn't. With practice you can differentiate an expression like
$ \frac{\sqrt{x^3+2x}\cdot \tan(x)}{(x^5-7)^4}$ in your head as fast
as you can write it down. Really.  Even if this is not true, would you
rather compute this derivative using the Quotient Rule and Product
Rule?

\begin{ProficiencyDrill-1line}
  Try it and see.
\end{ProficiencyDrill-1line}

  Recall that in Problem~\#\ref{problem:GeneralPowerRule} you used the Product
  Rule to compute $\dx\left[(x+1)(x+2)(x+3)\cdots(x+n)\right]$. You
  should  redo this problem before attempting
  Problem~\#\ref{problem:GeneralPowerRule2}.


\begin{embeddedproblem}
  \label{problem:GeneralPowerRule2}
   Let $y=(x+1)(x+2)(x+3)\cdots(x+n)$.
         \begin{enumerate}[label={  (\alph*)}] 
         \item Take the logarithm of both sides of this formula and
           use the properties of logarithms to show that for
           $x\neq-1, -2, -3, \cdots, -n$
           $$
           \dx{y}=(x+1)(x+2)(x+3)\cdots(x+n)\left[\frac{1}{x+1}+\frac{1}{x+2}+\frac{1}{x+3}+\frac{1}{x+n}\right]\dx{x}.
           $$
         \item Show that the result of part (a) is equivalent to the
           solution of Problem~\#\ref{problem:GeneralPowerRule}.
         \end{enumerate}
\end{embeddedproblem}

The technique of taking the logarithm of both sides of an expression
like $y=y(x)$ and then differentiating is called \term{Logarithmic
  Differentiation}.  It can reduce the amount of tedious computation
needed considerably, so it is worth knowing how to use it.

\begin{embeddedproblem}
  Show that if $y=\sqrt{e^{x^2+x}\sin(x)}$, then
  $
  \dx{y}= \frac12\sqrt{e^{x^2+x}\sin(x)}\left(2x+1\cot(x)\right)\dx{x}
  $
  by
  \begin{enumerate}[label={  (\alph*)}] 
    \item Using Logarithmic Differentiation.
    \item Not using Logarithmic Differentiation.
    \item Does either method seem preferable to you? Explain.
   \end{enumerate}
\end{embeddedproblem}

\begin{embeddedproblem}
  \label{problem:LogarithmicDifferentiation1}
  Compute the derivative of each of the following  functions.
  \begin{enumerate}[label={  (\alph*)}]
 \begin{multicols}{4}
  \item $y=\left[x(x+1)\right]^7$
    \solution{
      $        \dfdx{y}{x} = \left[x(x+1)\right]^7\left[\dfrac7x+\dfrac{7}{x+1}\right]$\\
      $ \dfdx{z}{x} = \ln\left(\dfrac7x+\dfrac{7}{x+1}\right)$}
  \item
    $        y=\sqrt{x(x+1)}$
                  \item
    $         y= \frac{1}{x(x-1)(x-2)}$
                  \item
    $        y= \ln\left({\frac{x\sqrt{x^2+1}}{(x+1)^{2/3}}}\right)$
                      \end{multicols}
\end{enumerate}
\vskip-4mm 
\end{embeddedproblem}

There are some situations where logarithmic differentiation is your
only option.  Consider something like $y=x^x.$ Unfortunately, this is
not a monomial like $x^2$ nor is it an exponential like
$2^x$.  This is some strange combination of both and  our existing
rules don't directly apply. But Logarithmic Differentiation will work.


\begin{embeddedproblem}
  For each of the following find $\dx{y}$, and $\dfdx{y}{x}$.
  \begin{enumerate}[label={  (\alph*)}]
    \begin{multicols}{4}
    \item $y=x^x$
    \item $y=x^{\ln(x)}$
    \item $y=x^{\frac{1}{\ln(x)}}$
    \item $y=(x^2+1)^{\sin(x)}$
    \end{multicols}
  \end{enumerate}
\end{embeddedproblem}

Finally, because we've given it a name it is easy to get the
impression that Logarithmic Differentiation is a new differentiation
rule, but it isn't. It is really just a trick as the next problem
shows. A handy trick, to be sure, but still a trick. 

\begin{embeddedproblem}
  Suppose we want to differentiate $y=[\alpha(x)]^{\beta(x)}$ where
  $\alpha(x)$ and $\beta(x)$  are two differentiable functions.
  \begin{enumerate}[label={  (\alph*)}]
    \item Compute $\dfdx{y}{x}$ using Logarithmic
      Differentiation.
    \item Now express $\alpha(x)$ as
      $\alpha(x)=e^{\ln\left(\alpha(x)\right)}$ and compute
      $\dfdx{y}{x}$ again using the ordinary rules of differentiation
      and show that you get the same thing as in part (a).
    \end{enumerate}
\end{embeddedproblem}

\begin{embeddedproblem-1line}
  Suppose $x^y=y^x$ and show that  $\dfdx{y}{x}=\frac{y-x\ln(y)}{x-y\ln(x)}$. 
\end{embeddedproblem-1line}


\section{Leonhard Euler, Harmonic Oscillators, and Complex Numbers}
\label{sec:leonh-euler-harm}
\mycenterquote{After exponential quantities the circular functions, sine
  and cosine, should be considered because they arise when imaginary
  quantities are involved in the exponential.}{\href{https://mathshistory.st-andrews.ac.uk/Biographies/Euler}{Leonhard
  Euler} $(1707-1783)$}{.85}

Recall that in Section~\ref{sec:simple-harm-oscill} we saw that the
differential equation that models the motion of an object having mass
$m$, bouncing on a spring without resistance is the simple harmonic
oscillator equation:
<me>

  m\dfdxn{y}{t}{2}= -ky,\label{eq:SHO6}

</me>
where $k$ is the spring constant.  The solution of
Equation~(\ref{eq:SHO6}) is  
<me>

  y(t)=A\sin\sqrt{\frac{k}{m}}t+B\cos\sqrt{\frac{k}{m}}t\label{eq:SHOSpringSolution}

</me>
where $A$ and $B$ are arbitrary constants.


Equation~(\ref{eq:SHOSpringSolution}) is unrealisitic because the
oscillations described never vary.  In the real world, as a result of
friction, the spring's oscillations will get shorter and shorter,
eventually stopping altogether. How could we modify this model in
order to capture the effects of, say, air resistance?

A relatively simple way to model this resistance is to assume that the
resistive force is proportional to the speed of the object. This
sounds imposing but you are quite familiar with this sort of
resistance. If you put your hand out the window of a moving car
you'll notice that as the car moves faster there is more force (wind)
pushing back on your hand.  This simple model breaks down at high
speeds where factors such as turbulence will also affect the
resistance, but it can be shown experimentally that the assumption
that the resistive force is proportional to velocity works well for
our spring.


Putting the words ``resistance is proportional to velocity'' into
symbols means we need to add the term $-b\dfdx{y}{t}$ to
Equation~(\ref{eq:SHO6}) where $b\gt0$ is a constant which depends on
the viscosity of the ambient medium (air, in this case).  (Why must
this proportionality be negative?)


Thus our model for harmonic oscillation with resistance becomes
$$
m\dfdxn{y}{t}{2}=-b\dfdx{y}{t}-ky
$$
or
<me>

  \dfdxn{y}{t}{2}+\frac{b}{m}\dfdx{y}{t}+\frac{k}{m}y = 0.\label{eq:DampedOscillator1}

</me>

Equation~(\ref{eq:DampedOscillator1}) is a little scary to look at, let alone
try to solve.  We'll begin with a simplified version where
$b=k=m$:
<me>

  \dfdxn{y}{t}{2}+\dfdx{y}{t}+y=0.\label{eq:DampedProblem1}

</me>



\begin{embeddedproblem-enumerate}
  \label{problem:DampedOscillator1}  
  \begin{enumerate}[label={  (\alph*)}] 
  \item Show that:
    $$ y(t)=e^{-\frac{t}{2}} \left[
      A\cos\left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}t\right)+B\sin\left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}t\right)
    \right]$$ satisfies Equation~(\ref{eq:DampedProblem1}) for any
    constants $A$ and $B$.
  \item Let $A=1, B=0$ and plot this solution for $0\le t\le 15$ and
    $-0.5\le y \le 0.5.$ Does this seem to model a damped oscillation?
  \end{enumerate}
\end{embeddedproblem-enumerate}

It is one thing to confirm a given solution as in
Problem~\#\ref{problem:DampedOscillator1},  but  quite another to
find the
solution in the first place.  A natural question to ask is
``How was this problem solved the first time?''


\subsection*{How Euler Did It\aside{This heading was
  borrowed from the \href{http://eulerarchive.maa.org/hedi/index.html}{series of articles} of the same name, written by
  the late Prof. Ed Sandifer, of Western Connecticut State University }}

  \centerline{$(1707-1783)$}}
\label{fig:EulerPortrait}
\end{wrapfigure}
Leonhard Euler\aside{\href{https://mathshistory.st-andrews.ac.uk/Biographies/Euler}{Euler} was one of the all-time great
  mathematicians. In any list of stellar mathematicians, he would
  stand out among the best.  Indeed, Pierre-Simon Laplace
  $(1749-1827)$, an outstanding mathematician in his own right, was
  once asked by a novice how best to learn Calculus. Laplace told him
  ``Read Euler, read Euler, he is the master of us all.''}
$(1707-1783)$ solved the differential
Equation~(\ref{eq:DampedProblem1}) by guessing that for some
carefully chosen  value of $c$
$$
y(t)=e^{ct}
$$
would be a solution. In view of the
results of Problem~\#\ref{problem:DampedOscillator1} this guess looks
completely crazy. Where is the sine? Where is the cosine? Nothing
seems to be oscillating!

It is
difficult to imagine what might have led him to make such a guess.
But Euler knew that if his guess didn't pan out he didn't have to tell anyone
about it. He could just toss all of his notes into his fireplace and
pretend that he'd never made his crazy-seeming guess.

The really crazy thing though, is that Euler's guess worked. Here's
how.

The key is the constant $c$. By leaving it unspecified Euler\aside{By
  the way, his name is pronounced ``oiler,'' not ``you-ler.''} gave
himself a little ``wiggle room.'' All he had to do now was find a
value of $c$ that would work.

\begin{embeddedproblem}
  Show that if $y=e^{ct}$ satisfies the differential equation
  $\displaystyle
  \dfdxn{y}{t}{2}+\dfdx{y}{t}+y=0
  $
  then $c$ must satisfy the quadratic equation 
  <me>

    \label{eq:ImagSolution}
    c^2+c+1=0.

</me>
  \hint{Put the first two derivatives of $y$  into the
    differential equation.}
\end{embeddedproblem}

Solving  Equation~(\ref{eq:ImagSolution} we see that
$
c=\frac{-1}{2}\pm\frac{\sqrt{-3}}{2},
$
 so we conclude that if $c=-\frac12+\frac{\sqrt{-3}}{2}$ or
$c=-\frac12-\frac{\sqrt{-3}}{2}$ then $y=e^{ct}$ satisfies
Equation~(\ref{eq:DampedProblem1}).

The appearance of $\sqrt{-3}$ is troubling since there is no real
number which is the square root of a negative number. But Euler knew
that such ``imaginary'' numbers had been effectively used in the
previous century, although no one could yet explain what they really
were\aside{Descartes had dubbed them as ``imaginary'' in his book
  \pubtitle{La Geometrie} in $1637$: ``.\ .\ . whereas we can always
  imagine as many roots for each equation as I have predicted, there
  is still not always a quantity which corresponds to each root so
  imagined.''  }. Knowing that if nothing useful came of his efforts
he could discard them and try something else, Euler decided to
treat the square roots of negative numbers, like differentials, as
``convenient fictions''


Since he had assumed that $c$ was a constant Euler
wanted to see where that assumption would lead. In particular he
decided to treat $\sqrt{-3}$ as the constant it is.
To make things ``easier on the eyes,'' Euler wrote
$\sqrt{-3} = \sqrt{3}\cdot\sqrt{-1}$ and set $\sqrt{-1}=i$.

Euler now had two solutions of Equation~(\ref{eq:DampedProblem1}), one
for each possible value of $c$:
\begin{align*}
  y_1(t)\amp =e^{\left(-\frac12+\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}i\right)t} =
  e^{-\frac{t}{2}}\cdot e^{\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}it} \\
  \intertext{  and  }
  y_2(t)\amp =e^{\left(-\frac12-\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}i\right)t}
  =e^{-\frac{t}{2}}\cdot e^{-\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}it},
\end{align*}
but the presence of $i=\sqrt{-1}$ makes it hard to understand what
these solutions could mean.


\begin{embeddedproblem}
  \label{problem:DampOscExpSol}
  Assume that $i=\sqrt{-1}$ is a constant.
       \begin{enumerate}[label={  (\alph*)}] 
         \item Show that $y_1(t)$ is a solution of
           Equation~(\ref{eq:DampedProblem1}).
         \item Show that $y_2(t)$ is also a solution of
           Equation~(\ref{eq:DampedProblem1}).
         \item Show that if $a$ and $b$ are constants then
           $w(t)=ay_1(t)+by_2(t)$
           is also a solution of Equation~(\ref{eq:DampedProblem1}).
        \end{enumerate}
\end{embeddedproblem}




To find meaning in his solutions he returned to the simpler
Equation~(\ref{eq:SHO6}),
$$  m\dfdxn{y}{t}{2}= -ky,$$ which he
already knew how to solve. To make things simpler still he assumed
that $m=k=1$ and tried his crazy guess, $y=e^{ct}$ again on
<me>

  \label{eq:EulerSimpleSHO-1}
  \dfdxn{y}{t}{2}= -y.

</me>

\begin{embeddedproblem} 
  \label{problem:DampedOscillation1}
  Show that $y=e^{ct}$ is a solution of the differential
  Equation~(\ref{eq:EulerSimpleSHO-1}) when $c=i$ or $c=-i$.
\end{embeddedproblem}
Problem~\#\ref{problem:DampedOscillation1} shows that $y=e^{it}$ and
$y=e^{-it}$ are both solutions of
Equation~(\ref{eq:EulerSimpleSHO-1}), 
but Euler knew (as we do\aside{See
Section~(\ref{sec:more-high-deriv}).}) that the solution of
Equation~(\ref{eq:EulerSimpleSHO-1}) is
$
y(t)=a\cos(t)+b\sin(t)
$
where $a$ and $b$ are constants. 

He now had  very different looking solutions of
Equation~(\ref{eq:EulerSimpleSHO-1}). Euler guessed that somehow
these  must be the same, so he set
$$
e^{it}=a\cos(t)+b\sin(t)
$$
and tried to find $a$ and
$b$.

\begin{embeddedproblem-enumerate}
  \label{problem:EulersFormula}
  \begin{enumerate}[label={  (\alph*)}] 
  \item Show that if $e^{it}=a\cos(t)+b\sin(t),$ then $a=1$ and $b=i.$\\
    \hint{To get $a,$ substitute $t=0.$ To get $b,$ differentiate
      first.}
  \item Show that if $e^{-it}=a\cos(t)+b\sin(t),$ then $a=1$ and
    $b=-i.$
  \end{enumerate}
\end{embeddedproblem-enumerate}

From part (a) of Problem~\#\ref{problem:EulersFormula} we get the
formula,
<me>

e^{it}=\cos(t)+ i\sin(t).\label{eq:EulerIdentity}

</me>
Equation~(\ref{eq:EulerIdentity} is known as \term{Euler's Identity} and it
is foundational to electrical engineering, and physics (especially
Quantum Mechanics). For mathematicians it is the key to 
understanding the geometry of the \term{Complex Numbers} (numbers of
the form $a+bi$, where $a$ and $b$ are real numbers and $i^2=-1$).

For Euler, it was a way to translate trigonometric functions to
exponential (and hyperbolic trigonometric) functions and back.  For
us, it is the key to our dampened oscillation problem.

Before we get to that, notice the following curious\aside{We call this
  curious because it relates the numbers $0, 1, i, e$ , and $\pi$ all
  in one simple formula. To find out what it actually means you'll
  need to become a mathematics major and take a course in Complex
  Analysis. It's fun. You should do that.} consequences of Euler's
Identity.
\begin{ProficiencyDrill}
  Show that $e^{i\pi}+1=0$.
  \end{ProficiencyDrill}
  
  Another curious consequence is that the trigonometric functions and
  the hyperbolic trigonometric functions are related via the constant
  $i=\sqrt{-1}$.

\begin{embeddedproblem}
  \begin{enumerate}[label={  (\alph*)}] 
        \begin{multicols}{2}
        \item Show that $ \cosh(it)=\frac{e^{it}+e^{-it}}{2}=\cos(t)$
        \item Show that
          $\frac{1}{i}\sinh(it)=\frac{e^{it}-e^{-it}}{2i}=\sin(t)$.
        \end{multicols}
      \end{enumerate}
    \end{embeddedproblem}
                              
  Finally, we return to Equation~(\ref{eq:DampedProblem1}). In
  Problem~\#\ref{problem:DampedOscillator1} we saw that
  $$ z(t)=e^{-\frac{t}{2}} \left[
    A\cos\left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}t\right)+B\sin\left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}t\right)
  \right]$$ and  in part (c) of Drill~\#\ref{problem:DampOscExpSol} we saw that
  $$
  y= e^{-\frac{t}{2}}\left[ae^{\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}it} +
    be^{-\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}it}\right]
  $$
  is another.
  If these are the same solution we can find a
  relation between the constants $a$, $b$, $A$, and $B$.

    
    \begin{embeddedproblem-enumerate}
      \begin{enumerate}[label={  (\alph*)}]

        \right],\\
        \intertext{that}
        w(t)\amp =e^{-\frac{t}{2}}\left[ae^{\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}it}
          + be^{-\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}it}\right],
        \end{align*}
        and that $z(t)=w(t)$,
        use Euler's Identity to show that $A=a+b$ and that $B=i(a-b)$.
      \item Show that if $w(t)$ satisfies  the
        initial conditions
        \begin{align*}
          w(0)\amp =0\\
          w^\prime(0)\amp =1.
        \end{align*}
        then  $a=-\frac{i}{\sqrt{3}}$ and
        $b=\frac{i}{\sqrt{3}}$.\\
        \hint{If $i^2=-1$ what is $\frac{-1}{i}$ equal to? }
      \item Use $a$ and $b$ from part (b) to  show that $A$ and $B$ are real numbers.
