        By relieving the brain of all unnecessary work, a good
        notation sets it free to concentrate on more advanced problems, and,
        in effect, increases the mental power of the
        race.

        The Bubonic Plague is also called the Black Death.
      </p>
    </aside>

    <p>
      Since the Covid-19 pandemic of <m>2020</m> the following story
      has become very popular. In <m>1665</m> an outbreak of Bubonic
      Plague closed Cambridge University.  One of the students, a
      young man named <url
      href="https://mathshistory.st-andrews.ac.uk/Biographies/Newton/"
      visual="https://mathshistory.st-andrews.ac.uk/Biographies/Newton/">Isaac
      Newton</url>, decided to continue his studies on his own at his
      country home in Woolsthorpe, Lincolnshire, UK. It was during
      this time that Newton worked out the basic principles of Optics,
      his Law of Universal Gravitation, and his version of the
      Calculus. He was under <m>25</m> years old at the time.
    </p>
    <p>
      The basic facts of this story are essentially correct. The
      Plague did close Cambridge University in <m>1665</m>, Newton was
      under <m>25</m>, he did retire to Woolsthorpe, and he did
      investigate Optics and Gravitation during this time. The
      mathematics that he needed did not exist at the time so he
      invented it. Today we call it Calculus.
    </p>
    <p>
      But telling Newton's story this way is misleading. It leaves the
      impression that he did all of these things during his two years
      at Woolsthorpe; sewed them up in a neat little package;
      bequeathed them to the rest of humanity and then ascended
      directly into heaven as a scientific demi-god.
    </p>
    <aside>
      <title>Historical Note</title>
      <p>
        To be sure Newton did a <em>lot</em> during his retreat to
        Woolsthorpe, and he was a scientific demi-god. But if he
        ascended into heaven he did it in the usual way in <m>1727</m>
        at the age of <m>84</m>.

      This is not true. In fact, he continued to work on optics after
      returning to Cambridge, but did not publish his first results
      until <m>1672</m>. He worked on his gravitational theory until
      at least <m>1687</m> when he published the first edition of his
      book <pubtitle>Philosophiae Naturalis Principia
      Mathematica</pubtitle> (Mathematical Principles of Natural
      Philosopy).

    <p>
      When you're a genius you can do that.
    </p>
    <p>
      Newton's story is often treated as inspirational but the fact
      that he did so much, so young seems to us (the authors of this
      book) more intimidating than inspiring. We are considerably
      older than <m>25</m> and taken together we haven't done anything
      as impressive as Newton did in his youth.
    </p>
    <p>
      But comparing ourselves to Newton is pointless. Newton was a true
      genius.  We are merely ordinary people just like you. We didn't invent
      Calculus, and you don't have to either. Newton did that for
      us. Everyone since has merely had to learn it; a much less imposing
      task.
    </p>
    <p>
      Well, almost everyone.
    </p>
    <p>
      About ten years after Newton entered Cambridge University, and quite
      independently,
      <url href="https://mathshistory.st-andrews.ac.uk/Biographies/Leibniz" visual="https://mathshistory.st-andrews.ac.uk/Biographies/Leibniz">Gottfried
      Wilhelm Leibniz</url> developed his rules for Calculus while employed as a
      diplomat in Paris from <m>1672</m> to <m>1674.</m> He was <m>26</m> years old at the
      time.

    <p>

      Though their approaches are fundamentally different, the computational
      techniques they worked out were essentially equivalent.  Newton's
      approach was dynamic. He was thinking about objects in motion: the
      moon, the planets, and falling apples. Leibniz was thinking about
      geometric relationships, more like Fermat or Descartes.
    </p>
    <p>

      As a matter of pure logic it doesn't really matter which viewpoint is
      adopted. However, there are some situations where thinking dynamically
      (like Newton) is more helpful, and others where thinking geometrically
      (like Leibniz) is more helpful. Throughout this text we will switch
      back and forth, adopting whichever approach seems to us more
      advantageous for a given situation. You should too.
    </p>
    <p>
      Newton was a private, almost secretive man. At first he didn't
      tell anyone about his invention and so Leibniz was first to
      publish a paper on Calculus in <m>1684</m>. We referred to his
      paper at the end of <xref
      ref="CHAPTERScienceBeforeCalc">Chapter</xref>:
    </p>
    <blockquote>      
      <p>  
        <pubtitle>
          A New Method for Maxima and Minima, as Well as Tangents,
          Which is Impeded Neither by Fractional nor Irrational
          Quantities, and a Remarkable Type of Calculus for This.
        </pubtitle>
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      From this rather imposing title we can infer that Leibniz was
      aware that his Calculus would empower mathematicians to more
      easily solve both old problems (like Snell's Law) and new
      problems alike.
    </p>
    <p>
      In his paper Leibniz displayed all of the General Differentiation
      Rules you will see at the beginning of the next section. He called his
      computational rules <q><foreign>Calculus Differentialis</foreign></q> which
      translates loosely as <q>rules for differences.</q>  In English this is
      called <term>Differential Calculus</term>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Newton and Leibniz each created and used a notation that reflected his
      own viewpoint.  Newton's notation has (mostly) fallen away over the
      years. Leibniz' notation is much more intuitive and has become
      standard in mathematics.
    </p>
    <p>
      Both assumed that a varying quantity could be increased or decreased
      by an infinitely small amount. Leibniz called this an infinitesimal
      difference, or a <term>differential</term> and denoted it with the letter
      ``d'' <mdash/> presumably for ``differential''.  So if <m>x</m> is some quantity,
      then its differential, <m>\dx{x}</m>, represents an infinitely small
      increase or decrease in <m>x.</m>
    </p>
    <p>
      To talk of infinitely small increments may sound strange to
      you. It does to most people, because it is in fact a truly weird
      idea. <url
      href="https://mathshistory.st-andrews.ac.uk/Biographies/Bernoulli_Johann/"
      visual="https://mathshistory.st-andrews.ac.uk/Biographies/Bernoulli_Johann/">Johann
      Bernoulli</url> described differentials this way:
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        <q>. . . a quantity which is increased or decreased by an infinitely
        small quantity is neither increased nor decreased . . . </q>
      </p>

        From <q>Great Moments in Mathematics After 1650,</q> Lecture
        32
      </attribution>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      You may judge for yourself how helpful this is. Johann and his brother
      Jacob both learned Calculus from Leibniz, and both went on to
      mathematical greatness in their own right.
    </p>

    <p>
      The idea of an infinitesimal was not new. Before the invention of
      Calculus mathematicians had been using the notion
      both successfully, and informally, for many years. Galileo and his
      students used them. So did Archimedes.  The idea was ``in the air.''
    </p>
    <p>
      But the vagueness of the notion was very troubling. In fact, late in
      his life Newton attempted to repudiate the idea of differentials by
      founding his version of Calculus on what he called <em>prime and
      ultimate ratios</em>.
      Leibniz simply continued the tradition of using differentials and
      invented the notational formalism that we still use
      today.
    </p>
    <p>

      Although neither of them could precisely answer the question, <q>What is a
      differential?</q> neither Leibniz nor Newton allowed this to hold them
      back. They developed their computational schemes, verified that they
      worked <mdash/> at least on the problems they were interested in
      <mdash/> and proceeded to use
      them to attack other problems. That was enough for them. Both men
      followed the example of their forebears and treated the notion of an
      infinitely small increment as a convenient fiction. Something
      that doesn't exist in reality but is useful as way to think about
      certain problems.  We will adopt a similar attitude <mdash/> at least for
      now.
    </p>
    <p>

      But this is mathematics. Eventually we will reach a time of reckoning
      when we must define our concepts clearly and precisely. All of
      them, not just the convenient ones.
    </p>
    <p>


      The question ``What is a differential?''  cannot simply be swept under
      the rug and ignored indefinitely.  Since everything we do will depend
      in a fundamental way on differentials, we must resolve this question
      or all of our work will rest on a foundation of shifting sands and we
      will never really know whether it is valid or not. If we do not
      proceed carefully, logically, from clearly stated first principles we
      can never truly know if what we are doing is valid.
    </p>
    <p>

      Indeed,
      Newton, Leibniz, and generations of mathematicians since understood
      this very well and worked hard to either give rigorous meaning to the
      idea of a differential or to abandon it altogether in favor of some
      other concept. Newton's idea of prime and ultimate ratios was probably
      the first such attempt.

      But it took some of the greatest minds in history nearly two hundred
      years to resolve the question of differentials.
    </p>
    <p>

      Well, <em>resolve</em> might be too strong a word.  The theory of limits,
      adopted in the late <m>19</m>th century, doesn't resolve the matter as much
      as it simply avoids it altogether. You'll see what we mean when we
      come to <xref ref="CHAformal-limits">Chapter</xref>
    </p>
    <p>

      In the mid-twentieth
      century
      <url href="https://mathshistory.st-andrews.ac.uk/Biographies/Robinson" visual="https://mathshistory.st-andrews.ac.uk/Biographies/Robinson">Abraham
      Robinson</url> (<m>1918-1974</m>) was finally able to put a develop the notion
      of a differential in a solid, rigorous manner. Unfortunately, to do
      this Robinson required some high level techniques from the field of
      Mathematical Logic which are quite beyond the scope of this text.
    </p>
    <p>

      Besides, Calculus already had a rigorous foundation. The theory of
      limits had been established nearly a hundred years before Robinson's
      work and it provides an entirely adequate foundation for Calculus.
      Unfortunately, the theory of limits does very little to help anyone
      actually <em>use</em> Calculus. It simply provides rigor for the logical
      foundations. On the other hand the differentials of Leibniz and
      Robinson do provide aid in using Calculus. Newton, Leibniz, and their
      contemporaries did truly amazing things by treating differentials as
      <em>convenient fictions</em>.  There is no reason we can't do the same.
    </p>
    <p>
      For now we will follow the example of our
      forbears and develop the Rules For Differences
      (<alert>
      Differential Calculus
    </alert>
    ) using Leibniz' differentials.  In
    particular, we will not concern ourselves with the question, ``What is
    a differential?''
    </p>
    <p>

      There is precedent for this. The ancient Greek mathematician
      <url href="https://mathshistory.st-andrews.ac.uk/Biographies/Euclid/" visual="https://mathshistory.st-andrews.ac.uk/Biographies/Euclid/">Euclid</url>,
      (325BC - 265BC)
      defined geometric points with the phrase ``A point is that which has
      no parts.'' But that is simply a clever way of admitting that he
      didn't know what points are, despite the fact that they are enormously
      useful.  What is a point, really, but a convenient fiction? And yet
      the notion of a point is foundational for all of Geometry. After all,
      what is a line but the relationship between two points? Moreover,
      mathematical points are highly intuitive and can be visualized in the
      mind's eye as long as we don't look too closely.
    </p>
    <p>
      Differentials will play a similar role in Calculus.

        Imagine a surgeon using a scalpel, an auto mechanic using
        a torque wrench, or a professional golfer swinging a
        club. These people endure countless hours of practice
        learning to use the fundamental tools of their trade. It
        is not fun, nor do they expect it to be. They do it in
        order to
      </p>
      <p>
        become so skillful that they can use their tools seamlessly;
        so they can focus on what they are doing, not how they are
        doing it. They don't think of the tool, they think of the
        task. The tool simply becomes an extension of their hands. In
        precisely the same way, the differentiation rules we'll be
        discussing in this chapter are the basic tools of your trade
        and you need to become so skillful with them that you can use
        them without thinking about them.

        become an extension of your mind. You need to be able to perform these
        calculations while holding a larger problem in your mind. Sometimes a
        much larger problem. You need to become so familiar with them that
        they become the simple part of bigger problems.

        computations; to give you a chance to internalize them before
        you have to use them in a larger context.  For that reason we will
        be providing a lot of drill problems for you to practice
        on. <em>Do them.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        These drill problems are not important in themselves, but once we move
        past this chapter it will be assumed that you can compute a
        differential -- even if the computation is long and complex --
        easily. If you have not given yourself enough practice here, you will
        struggle through the rest of this course. And the ones that come
        after. You may even fail.
      </p>
      <p>
        So, right here, right now,  resolve to do all of the
        problems in this chapter. Do them even if your instructor has not
        assigned them all. The more practice you get with this now, the less
        you will struggle later. Find other problems from other books and do
        them too. Make up your own problems. Practice until you can compute a
        differential with a quick glance.
      </p>
      <p>
        <alert>This is important.</alert> We, the authors of this text, know what we
        are talking about. Listen to us. Your goal in this chapter is to
        completely internalize these differentiation rules. They need to
        become second nature to you. The work you do now, here, will pay off
        in the long run.

      <p>
        The General Differentiation Rules are surprisingly
        easy to learn and remember. Moreover, despite the fact that we have
        six entries in our table there are really  only three rules. The
        Constant Rule, The Sum Rule, and the Product Rule are fundamental. The
        other three, The Constant Multiple Rule, The Power Rule, and the
        Quotient Rule are straightforward consequences of the first three. We
        only state them separately for convenience.
      </p>
      <p>

        We call these rules ``general'' because each one of them can
        be applied to a wide variety of expressions. In addition to the
        general rules there is a large set of specific rules that only apply
        to specific functions. We will come back to these beginning in
        <xref ref="CHAcalc-trig">Chapter</xref>
      </p>
      <p>
        To begin, suppose a point is moving along the <m>x</m>-axis. As in
        <xref ref="CHAproblem-solving">Chapters</xref> <xref ref="CHAPTERScienceBeforeCalc">and</xref>
        when we think of a point in motion we write <m>x(t)</m> to express the idea
        that the position <m>x</m>, depends on the time, <m>t</m>.  At a specific time,
        <m>t</m>, the position <m>x(t_1)</m>, is expressed as more compactly as <m>x_1</m>
        and at time <m>t_2</m> the position is <m>x_2</m>..
      </p>
      <p>
        The (small, finite) change in <m>x</m> is the difference
        between <m>x_2</m> and <m>x_1</m>: <m>x_2-x_1</m>, and the
        (small, finite) change in <m>t</m> is the difference between
        <m>t_2</m> and <m>t_1:</m> <m>t_2-t_1</m>.
      </p>
      <p>
        It is customary to denote these small, finite changes with the
        notation:
        <me>
          \Delta x = x_2-x_1, \text{ and } \Delta t= t_2-t_1.
        </me>
        We will denote infinitely small changes in <m>x</m> and <m>t</m> as <m>\dx{x}</m> and
        <m>\dx{t}</m>. The symbol <m>\dx{x}</m> is called the <term>differential</term> of <m>x</m>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Notationally, the distinction between <m>\Delta x</m> and
        <m>\dx{x}</m> is small, but conceptually it is profound. When
        we write <m>\Delta x</m> there is some measurable distance
        between <m>x_2</m> and <m>x_1.</m> When we write <m>\dx{x}</m>
        the distance between <m>x_2</m> and <m>x_1</m> is immeasurably
        (infinitesimally) small.
      </p>
      <p>
        If <m>x</m> is changing in time, <m>\dx{x}</m> represents how
        much <m>x</m> changes in an infinitesimally small increment of
        time <m>\dx{t}</m>. If the concept of an infinitely small
        increment troubles you (it should) it is safe, for now, to
        think of <m>\dx{x}</m> as a very, very, very,} small change in
        <m>x</m>.
      </p>
      <p>
        In general, if two variables, say <m>x</m> and <m>y</m>, are
        related we will be interested in asking (and answering) the
        question: If <m>x</m> is incremented by <m>\dx{x}</m> how will
        <m>y</m> be affected?

        <p>
          Now that we understand our notation the first
          differentiation rule is quite obvious. In fact, it is the
          same whether we are thinking of a small finite change or of
          a differential. If <m>x</m> is unchanging, if it is
          <em>not</em> moving, then ``the (infinitesimal) change in
          <m>x</m>'' between two different times is zero. It doesn't
          really matter whether we are talking about a finite
          <m>\Delta x</m> or an infinitesimal <m>\dx{x}</m>. Both are
          zero because <m>x</m> doesn't change. Thus we have the

<p>
Notice that like the Constant Rule, the
Sum Rule is true regardless of whether we are talking about finite
differences or differentials.
</p>
<p>
The Sum Rule is stated as if it only applies to the sum of <em>two</em>
quantities. This is typical of mathematical writing. We tend to be
minimalists so we don't state more than we absolutely have
to. However, if the Sum Rule applies to the sum of two quantities it
is straightforward to show that it also applies in the obvious fashion
to a sum of three, four, or more quantities.

          <p>
            <!-- \label{example:DifferentialRatioIsSlope} -->
            To get a sense of how we will be using differentials consider the
            line which is the graph of the equation <m>3x+2y=5</m>. Let's
            differentiate both sides of this formula using the tools we have so
            far.

            Obviously if two quantities are equal then their differentials are
            also equal. So,
            <me>
              \dx{(3x+2y)}=\dx{(5)}</me>.
              From the Sum Rule and the Constant Rule we have,
              <me>\dx{(3x)}+\dx{(2y)}=0</me> and from the Constant Multiple
              Rule we see that,
              <men  xml:id="EQUATIONSlope">

          <p>
            Notice that <xref ref="EQUATIONSlope">equation</xref> can be
            rearranged as follows: <m> \dfdx{y}{x} = -\frac32.  </m>
            So it appears that the <term>differential ratio</term>
            <m>\dfdx{y}{x}</m> is the slope of our line. This makes
            sense since <m>\dfdx{y}{x}</m> is the (infinitesimal)
            change in <m>y</m> divided by the (infinitesimal) change
            in <m>x</m>. From your study of lines in Algebra you know
            that the change in <m>y</m> divided by the change in
            <m>x</m> is the definition of slope. It continues to be
            the slope even if the changes in <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> are
            infinitesimal.

        <p>
          In his <m>1684</m> paper on Calculus, Leibniz presented all of
          the General Differentiation Rules with no justification
          whatsoever, stating simply that
        </p>
        <blockquote>
          <p>
            <q>The demonstration of all this will be easy to one who is
            experienced in these matters . . .</q>
          </p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>
          Our first three rules seem to bear this out. They are really the
          same as the analogous rules for finite differences.  His claim
          is a bit more suspect for the next differentiation rule.
        </p>

        <title>The Product Rule</title>
        <fact  xml:id="THEOREMProdRule">
          <p>
            <m>\dx{(xy)}=x\dx{y}+y\dx{x}.</m>
          </p>
        </fact>
          <proof>
            <title><foreign>Ad Hoc</foreign> Proof</title>
        <p>
          Think of the product <m>xy</m> as the (A)rea of the rectangle
          with sides of length <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> so that
          <m>A=xy</m>, as shown in the following sketch.
        </p>
        <image source="images/ProductRule7.png" width="50%"/>
        <p>
          If we increase the sides by <m>\dx{x}</m> and <m>\dx{y}</m>,
          respectively, then the area will change by an infinitesimal
          amount <m>\dx{A}</m> which is the sum of areas of the blue,
          yellow, and red regions shown in the sketch.  The area of the
          blue region is <m>x\dx{y}</m>, the area of the red region is
          <m>y\dx{x}</m> and the area of the yellow region is
          <m>\dx{x}\dx{y}</m>.  Since <m>\dx{A}</m> is the sum of these
          three regions we have
          <men  xml:id="EQUATIONDifferentialProductRule">
            \dx{A} =x\dx{y}+y\dx{x}+\dx{x}\dx{y}.
          </men>
        </p>
        <p>
          But remember that <m>\dx{x}</m> and <m>\dx{y}</m> represent
          infinitely small changes.  Thus, their product
          <m>\dx{x}\dx{y}</m> is even more infinitely small than they
          are. (Quadratically infinitely small?)
        </p>

        <p>
          In fact, the product <m>\dx{x}\dx{y}</m> is so small
          compared to any of the other terms in <xref
          ref="EQUATIONDifferentialProductRule">Equation</xref> that
          it simply doesn't matter. So we will ignore it.
        </p>
        <p>
          This leaves us with <m>\dx{A}=\dx(xy)=x\dx{y}+y\dx{x}</m> verifying the
          Product Rule.
        </p>
</proof>


        <p>
          You should feel at least a little uncomfortable with the  logical
          sleight of hand in our 
<foreign>ad hoc</foreign> proof of <xref ref="THEOREMProdRule">The Product Rule</xref>. Some questions present themselves immediately: How
          can we choose not to ignore infinitesimals like <m>\dx{x}</m> and <m>\dx{y}</m>,
          but then choose to ignore their product <m>\dx{x}\dx{y}</m>? What happens
          if <m>x</m> or <m>y</m> is negative? What happens if <m>\dx{x}</m> or <m>\dx{y}</m> is
          negative?
        </p>
        <p>
          Perhaps Leibniz left out the demonstrations (proofs) of his
          rules because he knew they would be controversial.  However, he
          was not lying when he said that those familiar with
          infinitesimals would understand.  Newton also ignored products
          of infinitesimals in his version of Calculus.  As we discussed
          in <xref ref="SECTIONHist-intr">Section</xref>, it took
          mathematicians some <m>200</m> years to sort this out.  We will
          begin to address this problem in the <xref
          ref="CHAPTERWhatsWrong"></xref>. For now, we will
          simply accept that the Product Rule works as we've stated it
          knowing full well that we are on shaky ground that will
          eventually need to be firmed up.

              <!-- \label{problem:dydxIsSlope} -->
              Use the Product Rule to show that if <m>y=x^2</m>, then

          Even though they could not fully explain their methods, both
          Newton and Leibniz could see that their methods gave answers
          that made sense physically and which agreed with the results
          of their predecessors.  That is, their methods worked.
        </p>
        <p>
          For example, in <xref ref="PROBferm-meth-x2">Problem</xref>
          you used Fermat's method for tangents to show that at the
          point <m>(1,1)</m> the slope of the curve <m>y=x^2</m> is
          <m>2</m> and that at the point <m>(-2,4)</m> the slope of the
          curve is <m>-4</m>. Recall from <xref
          ref="EXAMPLEDifferentialRatioIsSlope">Example</xref> that the
          differential ratio <m>\dfdx{y}{x}</m> represents the slope of
          the curve. With this in mind we rewrite the formula
          <m>\dx{y}=2x\dx{x}</m> from <xref
          ref="PROBLEMdydxIsSlope">Problem~\</xref> as <m>
          \dfdx{y}{x}=2x</m>, from which we see that the Product Rule
          easily recovers Fermat's results.
        </p>
        <p>
          But what can it mean to say that the slope of the graph of
          <m>y=x^2</m> is <m>2x</m>? The expression <m>2x</m> changes
          with <m>x</m> but slope is supposed to be constant isn't it?
          Moreover, slopes have always been associated with straight
          lines in the past, but there is not a straight line to be seen
          anywhere in this problem.
        </p>
        <p>
          Or is there?
        </p>
        <p>
          The notion of a differential is essentially an extension of
          the following observation: If you look very closely at a curve
          it looks like a straight line. You can confirm this with any
          graphing technology. Graph a curve and zoom in repeatedly at
          any point on the curve. Eventually the curve will look like a
          straight line, and the slope of that line will be the value of
          <m>\dfdx{y}{x}</m> at that point.  If we extend this
          observation to the infinitely small scale we get
          differentials.
        </p>
        <p>
          The idea that at the infinitely small scale lines and curves
          are indistinguishable is known as the <term>Principal of Local
          Linearity</term>, and it is a fundamental principle underlying
          all of Calculus.  We will formally define the Principle of
          Local Linearity in <xref
          ref="SECdefin-tang-line">Section</xref>. For now, the informal
          idea is that when you look at a very small section of a curve
          it looks like a straight line. When we choose to simply ignore
          the term <m>\dx{x}\dx{y}</m> in our development of the Product
          Rule we are invoking the Principle of Local Linearity

          Again, Newton and Leibniz relied on the fact that their methods
          produced solutions that made sense physically and which agreed with
          known solutions to old problems. Snell's Law is an example of the
          latter. The following problem is an example of the former.

              When a rock is tossed into a quiet lake it generates an
              expanding, circular wave, as in the diagram below.

            <p>
              The area enclosed by the wave at any time is given by the
              formula: <m>A=\pi r^2</m>, where <m>r</m> is the expanding
              radius of the circle.  As time advances the radius of the
              circular wave expands and, as a consequence, the area enclosed
              by the wave also grows.

          <title>Differential Notation</title>
          <p>
            We will pause here for a moment to take explicit notice of
            the notational convenience we used in part (a) of <xref ref="PROBLEMCircleDifferential"></xref>
            because it will be
            useful later.  We have used the expression <m>\dx{x}</m> to
            represent an infinitesimal displacement of <m>x</m>, but it
            will be useful to think of the ``<m>\dx{ }</m>'' as meaningful
            in itself. That is, in the expression <m>\dx(\pi r^2)</m> we
            think of the ``d'' as ``operating on'' the expression <m>\pi
            r^2.</m> Thus when <m>\dx{}</m> ``operates on'' the expression
            <m>\pi r^2</m> it returns the expression <m>2\pi r\dx{r}</m>
            and we have <m>\dx{A}=\dx(\pi r^2) = 2\pi r
            \dx{r}.</m> This is actually consistent with our previous
            usage if we think of <m>\dx(A)</m> as ``operating on'' the
            area <m>A</m> and returning the differential <m>\dx{A}.</m>
          </p>
          <p>
            This is akin to the way we think about the square root
            symbol. The symbol <m>\sqrt{\phantom{4}}</m> ``operates on''
            the expression underneath it so we have <m>\sqrt{4}=2.</m>
            Just as <m>\sqrt{\phantom{4}}</m> is always reserved for the
            square root <em>of some quantity</em>, <m>\dx{}</m> is always
            reserved for the differential <em>of some quantity</em>. In
            both cases the quantity needs to be named. It is as
            meaningless to write <m>\pi r^2\dx{}</m> as it is to write
            <m>\pi r^2\sqrt{\phantom{4}}.</m> It is important to use the
            notation as it was designed to be used.
          </p>
          <p>
            Also, notice that on the left side of <m> \dx{A}=\dx(\pi
            r^2) = 2\pi r \dx{r}</m> we have the infinitesimal quantity,
            <m>\dx{A}</m>.  Since the two sides of the equation are
            equal it follows that the quantity on the right side is also
            an infinitesimal. The obvious conclusion is that the
            ordinary real number <m>2\pi r</m> multiplied by the
            infinitesimal <m>\dx{r}</m> must result in an infinitesimal
            quantity. Dividing both sides by <m>\d{r}</m> we have
            <m>\dfdx{A}{r}=2\pi r</m>, which seems to indicate that the
            quotient of two differentials will be an ordinary real
            number. Does this make intuitive sense to you?
          </p>
          <p>
            Notice that we asked if it makes <em>intuitive</em>
            sense. When working with differentials it frequently happens
            that a statement feels right (makes intuitive sense) but
            begins to fall apart when examined more carefully.

  By custom, differentials are written at the end of each term where
  they appear in a given computation so the Product Rule is usually
  written as

  \dx{(xy)}=x(\dx{y})+y(\dx{x}).

  But this is just a custom so it is not strictly necessary.  We could

<p>
 <xref ref="EQUATIONPwrRulePosInt">Equation</xref> is called the <term>Power  Rule for Positive Integers</term>.
</p>
<p>
Let's try out our differentiation rules on a relatively simple
example. We will include every single step so that you can see how the
differentiation rules are used in concert.
</p>
<example xml:id="examp:DiffRulesInConcert1">
<p>
  <!-- \label{examp:DiffRulesInConcert1}  -->
  From the Sum Rule we have,
<me>
\dx\left(5x^6-3x^4+21x^2-7\right)
     =\dx\left(5x^6\right)-\dx\left(3x^4\right)+\dx\left(21x^2\right)-\dx(7).
</me>
Next, the Constant Rule, and  the Constant Multiple Rule give,
<me>
\dx\left(5x^6-3x^4+21x^2-7\right)
     =
    5\dx\left(x^6\right)-3\dx\left(x^4\right)+21\dx\left(x^2\right)-0,
</me> 
and by the Power Rule for Positive Integers we have,
<me>
\dx\left(5x^6-3x^4+21x^2-7\right)
     =
    5\left(6x^5\dx{x}\right)-3\left(4x^3\dx{x}\right)+21\left(2x^1\dx{x}\right)
</me>
<me>
\dx\left(5x^6-3x^4+21x^2-7\right)
     =30x^5\dx{x}-12x^3\dx{x}+42x\dx{x}.
</me>
Finally, factoring out the differential of <m>x</m> gives,
<me> 
   \dx\left(5x^6-3x^4+21x^2-7\right) =\left(30x^5-12x^3+42x\right)\dx{x}.
</me>
</p>
<p>
  Did you notice that the differential <m>\dx{x}</m> appeared in every term
  allowing us to factor it out at the end? When there is only one
  independent variable involved (<m>x</m> in this case) that will
  \emph{always} happen. So it provides an easy way to check your
  computations.
</p>
<p>
  If you end with an expression where the differential of the
  independent variable cannot be factored out then you have made a
  mistake in your computations.  You should find your mistake before
  going on. Or just begin again.
      </p>
</example>

<p>
As you become more skilled you will probably do many of the steps from
<xref ref="EXAMPLEexamp:DiffRulesInConcert1"></xref> in your head.  But for now,
notice how the rules work together and are applied as they are needed.

  Differentiating both sides of an ordinary algebraic equation
  yields a \term{Differential Equation} -- an equation which
  relates the differentials of the quantities involved.
  For example, suppose we have a point <m>(x,y)</m> lying on the unit
  circle so that the quantities <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> are related by the
  equation <m> x^2+y^2=1</m>.

  Differentiating, we have the differential equation
  \begin{align}
    \nonumber    2x\dx{x}+2y\dx{y}\amp =0 \text{ or }
    y\dx{y}\amp =-x\dx{x}.\label{eq:UnitCircleDiff}
  \end{align}

  Let's look at this geometrically and focus on the first quadrant.
  The sketch at the left shows what happens to the quantities <m>x</m> and
  <m>y</m> as the point changes its position on the circle.

  The smaller triangle is called a \term{differential
    triangle}\aside{Because all three sides are differentials,
    obviously.}  and it is infinitely small. Differential triangles
  were a favorite tool of Leibniz. He assumed without justification
  (as we will, for now) that they are just like ordinary (finite)
  triangles.

  Notice that <m>\dx{x}</m> is negative since the <m>x</m> coordinate is moving
  to the left, and that <m>\dx{y}</m> is positive since the <m>y</m> coordinate
  is moving upward. We need positive quantities to represent the
  length of the triangle's legs. Therefore we use <m>-\dx{x}</m> to represent a
  positive length for the horizontal leg of our differential triangle.

  A little more mysterious is the (correct) observation that the
  smaller triangle isn't really a triangle at all. Because it is
  part of the circle the
  line connecting <m>(x,y)</m> and <m>(x+\dx{x}, y+\dx{y})</m> -- the hypotenuse
  of the triangle -- is curved.
  But there is
  nothing lost by thinking of the  hypotenuse as  a straight line
  because according to the Principle of Local Linearity at an infinitely
  small scale lines and curves are indistinguishable.
                                  At least in part, this why Newton, Leibniz, and their contemporaries
  worked with differentials. At that scale they could replace curves
  with straight lines.  % A little further on we will state the

<p>
  <!-- \label{example:BruteForce} -->
  Suppose and we wish to find <m>\dx{y}</m> when <m>y=5(x^2+x)^3</m> One way to
  do this is simple brute force. That is, we compute
  \begin{align*}
    y=5\textcolor{red}{(x^2+x)^3} \amp = 5\textcolor{red}{(x^6+3x^5+3x^4+x^3)}
    = 5x^6+15x^5+15x^4+5x^3.
    \intertext{Applying the Sum Rule we see that}
    \dx y \amp = \dx \left(5x^6\right)+\dx \left(15x^5\right)+\dx
    \left(15x^4\right)+\dx \left(5x^3\right).
    \intertext{Next we use the
    Constant Multiple
    Rule, to get}
    \dx y \amp = 5\dx \left(x^6\right)+15\dx \left(x^5\right)+15\dx
    \left(x^4\right)+5\dx \left(x^3\right).
    \intertext{Finally, we use the Power Rule four times
    to get}
    \dx y \amp = 30x^5\dx x+75x^4\dx x+60x^3\dx x+15x^2\dx x.
    \dx y \amp = (30x^5+75x^4+60x^3+15x^2)\dx x.
  \end{align*}
  In the end we have,
  <me>
  \dx{y}= (30x^5+75x^4+60x^3+15 x^2)\dx{x}.
  </me>
  
  Brute force works but expanding an expression like
  <m>(x^2+x)^3</m> is dull (and error prone) and 
  mathematicians are like Nature: We are lazy.  We'd really
  rather avoid doing all of that dull computation if we
  possibly can. Wouldn't you?

  Suppose, we make this problem a little ``easier on the
  eyes'' with a substitution like we did in Section~\ref{sec:an-easy-problem-alg}.
  Let <m>z=x^2+x</m>.  Then our original
  problem becomes <m> y=5z^3</m> which is much easier to look
  at. And now <m>\dx{y}=15z^2\dx{z}</m>.  Substituting <m>x^2+x</m> back
  in for <m>z</m> we get
  <m>\dx y = 15(x^2+x)^2\dx (x^2+x).</m>
  After computing <m>\dx (x^2+x) = (2x+1)\dx x</m> we see that
  <me>\dx y = 15(x^2+x)^2(2x+1)\dx x.</me>

  Suppose we wish to find <m>\dx{y}</m> when <m>y=(x+2)^2(2x-3)^3</m>
  Once again we {could} just apply brute force by

  Instead notice that <m>y</m> is the \emph{product} of

  place to begin. But first we make it ``easier on the eyes''

    \amp = (x+2)^2(3)(2x-3)^2\textcolor{blue}{{\dx(2x-3)}} + (2x-3)^3(2)(x+2)\textcolor{red}{{\dx(x+2)}}

    \dx{y} \amp = \left[6(x+2)^2(2x-3)^2 + 2(2x-3)^3(x+2)\right]\dx{x}.
  \end{align*}
  Not only does this involve considerably less Algebra (and is
  thus less prone to error) it also gives us <m>\dx{y}</m> in a
  form that is easy to factor. This is important because, as we
  mentioned in our comment to
  Problem~\#\ref{problem:BruteForce}, many of the problems to
  come will involve finding a differential, setting it equal to
  zero, and then solving the resulting equation.  If we had computed
  this by brute force we would have to find the roots of a fully
  expanded fourth degree polynomial. That would be hard.  The
  form given above is much easier to work with. Let's go ahead
  and set <m>\dx{y}=0</m> and solve the resulting equation:
  <me>
  6\textcolor{red}{(x+2)}^2\textcolor{blue}{(2x-3)}^2 +
  2\textcolor{blue}{(2x-3)}^3\textcolor{red}{(x+2)} = 0.
  </me>
  just for practice.

  The prospects for solving the equation, even in this form
  seem pretty glum at first, but it really isn't so bad once
  we notice that <m>\textcolor{red}{(x+2)}</m> and
  <m>\textcolor{blue}{(2x-3)^2}</m> appear as factors in both
  terms on the left hand side.  Factoring these out
  gives

  \begin{align}
    \nonumber                                                              \textcolor{red}{(x+2)}\textcolor{blue}{(2x-3)^2}\left[6\textcolor{red}{(x+2)}+2\textcolor{blue}{(2x-3)}\right] \amp = 0
    \intertext{so that}
    \nonumber             \textcolor{red}{(x+2)}\textcolor{blue}{(2x-3)^2}\left[6x+12+4x-6)\right] \amp = 0
    \label{eq:EOE1}          2(x+2)(2x-3)^2(5x+3) \amp = 0.
  \end{align}

<p>
As you become more comfortable using these differentiation rules
together, you will probably do many of the steps in a long
differentiation more informally, perhaps even in your head. However,
most of the time differentiation will only be one part of much larger
problems. If you don't differentiate correctly whatever you do after
that is wasted time and effort. It is better to proceed slowly to be
sure you are right. If it helps to write out each step in detail then
you should certainly do that.
</p>

<p>
At this point we can find the differentials of a large number of
algebraic expressions. But not all. For example suppose
<m>y=\sqrt{x}.</m> Nothing we've done so far tells us what <m>\dx{y}</m> is.
</p>

<example xml:id="example:PowRuleExtension1">
<p>
  <!-- \label{example:PowRuleExtension1} -->
  However, you are surely aware that the radical symbol,
  <m>\sqrt{\phantom{4} }</m>,
  can be expressed as a fractional exponent. For example,
  <m>\sqrt{x} =x^{\frac12}.</m> It is tempting to simply assert that, by
  the Power Rule,
  <m>\dx(x^{1/2}) = \frac12\cdot x^{1/2-1}\dx{x} =
  \frac12\cdot\frac{1}{x^{1/2}}\dx{x} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2x}}\dx{x}.</m> In
  fact this is true, but it doesn't follow from the way we developed the
  Power Rule because we depended quite explicitly on the
  assumption that the exponent of <m>x^n</m> is a positive integer.

  Here's one way to prove that the Power Rule works when <m>n=1/2</m>. If
  <m>y=\sqrt{x}</m> then <m>y^2=x.</m> Computing the differential of both sides
  gives:
  \begin{align*}
    \dx(y^2)\amp =\dx x
    2y \dx{y}\amp =\dx x
    \dx{y}\amp =\frac{1}{2y} \dx x=\frac{1}{2x^{1/2}} \dx x=\frac{1}{2}\cdot\frac{1}{x^{1/2}} \dx{x}
  \end{align*}
  or <m> \dx{y} =\frac{1}{2}{x^{1/2-1}} \dx{x}</m> which is the Power Rule
  with <m>n=\frac12</m>.
</p>
</example>

<p>
This example is more important than it appears to be. What it shows
is that the Power Rule can be extended to include at least the case
where the exponent is <m>1/2</m>.  In fact, the Power Rule is easily
extended to allow the exponent to be any positive fraction, say
<m>2/3</m> for example.
</p>

<example xml:id="example:PowRuleExtension2">
<p>
  <!-- \label{example:PowRuleExtension2} -->
  You should be a little bit surprised at this. After all,
  <m>y=x^{2/3}</m> is a complicated thing, compared to <m>y=x^2</m>, or even
  <m>y=x^{1/3}</m>.  Nevertheless, essentially the same procedure works
  here too.  If <m> y=x^{2/3}</m>, then <m> y^3=x^2</m>.  Differentiating both
  sides gives
  <me> 3y^2\dx{y}=2x\dx{x}</me>
  and solving for <m>\dx{y}</m> leaves us with
  <me>\dx{y}=\frac23 \frac{x}{y^2}\dx{x}.</me>
  This is not yet recognizable as the Power Rule primarily because we
  need to express the right side entirely in terms of <m>x</m>. But recall that
  <m>y=x^{2/3}</m> so that <m>y^2=x^{4/3}</m>. Making that substitution gives
  <me> \dx{y} = \frac23\frac{x}{x^{4/3}\dx{x}}= \frac23
  x^{-\frac{1}{3}}\dx{x}= \frac23 x^{\frac{2}{3}-1}\dx{x}</me> which is
  the Power Rule with <m>n=2/3.</m>

  Having seen that the Power Rule can be extended to include positive,
  fractional exponents it is natural to ask if it can be extended
  to negative exponents  Can we find
  the differential of <m>y=1/x = \inverse{x}.</m>

  Of course we can.

  If <m>y=1/x</m> then <m>xy=1.</m> By the Product Rule we have
  \begin{align*}
    \dx(xy)=\dx(1)
    x\dx{y}+y\dx{x}\amp =0
    x\dx{y}\amp =-y\dx{x}
    \dx{y}\amp =-\frac{\textcolor{red}{y}}{x}\dx{x}=-\frac{\textcolor{red}{\frac1x}}{x}\dx{x}
    \amp=-\frac{1}{x^2}\dx{x}
    \intertext{and thus}
    \dx{y} \amp = \d{\left(\inverse{x}\right)}  =(-1)x^{(-1)-1}\dx{x}. 
  \end{align*}
  So the Power Rule works for <m>n=-1</m> as well.

We can now differentiate some pretty complicated
expressions. Frequently an appropriate substitution will make this
``easier on the eyes''  but otherwise at each step  only need
to invoke one of the General Differentiation Rules. When the expression is
complicated the key is to be methodical and do one step at a time
even if you are doing some of them in your head.

  To differentiate
  <m>\left(
    \sqrt{x^2-2}
  \right)
  \left(
    \sqrt{x}-2\right)</m>
  we begin by re-expressing the radicals as exponents because we have
  no differentiation rules for radicals.
  \begin{align*}
    \dx\left[{\left(\textcolor{red}{\sqrt{x^2-2}}\right)\left(\textcolor{blue}{\sqrt{x}-2}\right)}\right] \amp =
    \dx\left[\left(\textcolor{red}{(x^2-2)^{1/2}}\right)\left(\textcolor{blue}{x^{1/2}-2}\right)\right]
    \amp =
    (x^2-2)^{\frac12}\textcolor{blue}{\dx{\left(x^{\frac12}-2\right)}}+\left(x^{\frac12}-2\right)\textcolor{red}{\dx{(x^2-2)^{\frac12}}}
    \amp =
    (x^2-2)^{\frac12}\left(\frac12x^{-\frac12}\right)\dx{x}+\left(x^{\frac12}-2\right)\left(\frac12(x^2-2)^{-\frac12}\right)\textcolor{red}{\dx(x^2-2)}
    \amp =
    (x^2-2)^{\frac12}\left(\frac12x^{-\frac12}\right)\dx{x}+\left(x^{\frac12}-2\right)\left(\frac12(x^2-2)^{-\frac12}\right)2x\dx{x}
    \amp = \left[
    (x^2-2)^{\frac12}\left(\frac12x^{-\frac12}\right)+\left(x^{\frac12}-2\right)\left(\frac12(x^2-2)^{-\frac12}\right)2x\right]\dx{x}
  \end{align*}

  Be sure you can follow all the computations at each step in
  Example~\#\ref{example:ComplexDifferentiation1}. You may want to make
  some substitutions as you go. With practice, you will be able to do
  most of this in your head.

<p>
In most of <xref ref="DRILLdrill:spacetime">~\</xref> <m>y</m> is given explicitly in
terms of <m>x</m>. But in part (j) <m>y</m> is given implicitly. We've seen
this before.  Almost everyone's first impulse in this situation is
to try to solve this for <m>y</m> explicitly and then differentiate, but
(a) it isn't necessary, (b) it isn't always possible, and (c) even
when it is possible it is often harder that simply differentiating
the formula we're given.  Our differentiation rules remain
unchanged. After completing the differentiation we simply need to
solve for <m>\dx{y}</m>.
</p> 

<example>
<p>
  For example, how can we compute <m>\dx{y}</m> given that
  <me>
    2x^2-xy+z^3y^2 = 1+y?
    \label{eq:QuadImpl}
  </me>
  It is possible to solve this explicitly for <m>y</m> but it is
  difficult and the complexity of the computations tends to hide
  the underlying simplicity of the larger problem. Since
  Equation~(\ref{eq:QuadImpl}) is quadratic in <m>y</m> (the highest
  power of <m>y</m> is <m>2</m>) we need only use the Quadratic Formula to
  get <m>y</m> explicitly in terms of <m>x</m> and <m>z</m> and then differentiate. Try
  that some time when you have time to kill. Lots of time.
</p>
<p>
  Instead, we'll just apply our differentiation rules to
  Equation~(\ref{eq:QuadImpl}) as it is. Differentiating we have
  <me>
    4x\dx{x}-(x\textcolor{red}{\dx{y}}+y\dx{x})+\left(z^3(2y\textcolor{red}{\dx{y}})+y^2(3z^2\dx{z})\right)=\textcolor{red}{\dx{y}}.
    \label{eq:QuadImplDiff}
  </me>
  At first this may look very difficult to solve for <m>\dx{y}</m> but
  look again. This differential equation is actually linear in each
  of the differentials, <m>\dx{x}</m>, <m>\d{y}</m>, and <m>\d{z}</m>. That is,
  each differential only appears raised to the first power. This
  will always happen. When we differentiate any expression the
  result will always be linear in the differentials involved.
</p>

<p>
  We can rearrange our equation algebraically so that it has the
  following form.
  <me>
  (\text{stuff})\dx{y} = (\text{more stuff})\dx{x} + (\text{even
    more stuff})\dx{z}.
  </me>
  Solving for <m>\dx{y}</m> gives
  <me>
  \dx{y} = \frac{(\text{more stuff})\dx{x} + (\text{even
      more stuff})\dx{z}}{(\text{stuff})}.
  </me>
</p>

<p>
  For this example the specific computations are:
  \begin{align*}
    4x\dx{x}-x\textcolor{red}{\dx{y}}-y\dx{x} +
    2yz^3\textcolor{red}{\dx{y}}+3y^2z^2\dx{z}\amp=\textcolor{red}{\dx{y}}
    2yz^3\textcolor{red}{\dx{y}}-x\textcolor{red}{\dx{y}}-\textcolor{red}{\dx{y}}
    \amp=y\dx{x}-4x\dx{x}-3y^2z^2\dx{z}
    (2yz^3-x-1)\dx{y}\amp=(y-4x)\dx{x} - 2y^2z^2\dx{z}
    \dx{y}\amp=\frac{(y-4x)\dx{x} - 2y^2z^2\dx{z}}{2yz^3-x-1}.
  \end{align*}
</p>

<p>
  At this point we have solved our problem so we needn’t do any
  more. But notice that we could also write this as
  <me>
  \dx{y}=\frac{(y-4x)}{2yz^3-x-1}\dx{x} -
  \frac{2y^2z^2}{2yz^3-x-1}\dx{z}
  </me>.
</p>

<p>
  Some problems are legitimately hard, and some only look hard.
  So remember that as bleak as things may look sometimes, you
  should always keep your goal in view. In this case we were
  trying to isolate <m>\dx{y}</m>, so we gathered all of the terms that
  had <m>\dx{y}</m> in them, put all the other terms on the other side
  of the equation, factored out the <m>\d{y}</m> and divided by the
  ``stuff'' that formed the coefficient of <m>\d{y}</m>.  This process
  is often easier than trying to solve for <m>y</m> before
  differentiating.

        <title>The Power  Rule for Positive Integers</title>
        <p>
          Let's try out our differentiation rules on a relatively simple
          example. We will include every single step so that you can see how the
          differentiation rules are used in concert.
        </p>

        <example xml:id="examp:DiffRulesInConcert1">
          <!-- \label{examp:DiffRulesInConcert1}  -->
          <p>

            From the Sum Rule we have,
            <me>
              \dx\left(5x^6-3x^4+21x^2-7\right)
              =\dx\left(5x^6\right)-\dx\left(3x^4\right)+\dx\left(21x^2\right)-\dx(7).
            </me>
            Next, the Constant Rule, and  the Constant Multiple Rule give,
            <me>
              =
              5\dx\left(x^6\right)-3\dx\left(x^4\right)+21\dx\left(x^2\right)-0,
            </me>
            and by the Power Rule for Positive Integers we have,
            <mdn>
              <mrow number="no">
                \amp =
                5\left(6x^5\dx{x}\right)-3\left(4x^3\dx{x}\right)+21\left(2x^1\dx{x}\right)
              </mrow>
              <mrow  xml:id="EQUATIONPowRulPosInt">
                \amp =30x^5\dx{x}-12x^3\dx{x}+42x\dx{x}.
              </mrow>
            </mdn>
            Finally, factoring out the differential of <m>x</m> gives,
            <me>
              \dx\left(5x^6-3x^4+21x^2-7\right) =\left(30x^5-12x^3+42x\right)\dx{x}.
            </me>
          </p>


          <!-- \begin{align*} -->
          <!--   \dx\left(5x^6-3x^4+21x^2-7\right) -->
          <!--   \amp =\dx\left(5x^6\right)-\dx\left(3x^4\right)+\dx\left(21x^2\right)-\dx(7). -->
          <!--   \intertext{Next, Constant Rule, and  the Constant Multiple Rule give,} -->
          <!--   \amp = -->
          <!--   5\dx\left(x^6\right)-3\dx\left(x^4\right)+21\dx\left(x^2\right)-0, -->
          <!--   \intertext{and by the Power Rule for Positive Integers we have,} -->
          <!--   \amp = -->

          <!--   \amp =30x^5\dx{x}-12x^3\dx{x}+42x\dx{x}. -->
          <!--   \intertext{Finally, factoring out the differential of <m>x</m> gives,} -->
          <!--   \dx\left(5x^6-3x^4+21x^2-7\right)\amp =\left(30x^5-12x^3+42x\right)\dx{x}. -->
          <!-- \end{align*} -->
          <p>
            Did you notice that the differential <m>\dx{x}</m> appeared in
            every term of <xref
            ref="EQUATIONPowRulPosInt">Equation</xref>, allowing us to
            factor it out at the end? When there is only one independent
            variable involved (<m>x</m> in this case) that will
            <em>always</em> happen. So it provides an easy way to check
            your computations.  If you end with an expression where the
            differential of the independent variable cannot be factored
            out then you have made a mistake in your computations.  You
            should find your mistake before going on. Or just begin again.

    But notice that nothing we've done so far allows us to differentiate, say
    <m>y=x^{\sqrt{2}}</m>, since <m>\sqrt{2}</m> is irrational and  cannot be represented as a
    fraction. Having an irrational exponent is a bigger problem than it
    seems to be.

    Take a moment and ask yourself what an expression like

    Don't keep reading as if we didn't just tell you to
    stop. We're serious. Take a moment and think about this.
    How do you multiply <m>\sqrt{2}</m> copies o/f <m>x</m>
    together? Does that even mean anything? If so, what?
  </p>
  <p>
    We clearly have no way (so far) to interpret the meaning of an
    expression like <m>x^{\sqrt{2}}</m>.  So trying to find its
    differential using the techniques we have is hopeless.  In <xref

      Suppose we wish to find <m>\dx{y}</m> when <m>y=
      \frac{2-3x^2}{\sqrt{x}}</m>.  Rewriting this slightly we have <m>y=
      \frac{2-3x^2}{\sqrt{x}} = x^{\frac12}\left(2-3x^2\right) =
      2x^{-\frac12}-3x^{\frac32}</m>.  From the General Differentiation
      Rules we have:

        <mrow>
          \dx{y}\amp{} = \dx\left(\frac{2-3x^2}{x^{\frac12}}\right)

        <mrow>
          \amp = \dx\left(2x^{-\frac12}-3x^{\frac32}\right)
        </mrow>
        <mrow> 
          \amp = \left[2\left(-\frac12x^{-\frac32}\dx{x}\right)-3\left(\frac32x^{\frac12}\dx{x}\right)\right]

      Now suppose we have <m>z=1/y=\frac{\sqrt{x}}{2-3x^2}</m>.  Can we
      compute
      <m>\dx{z}</m>?      (Be sure you see why the previous approach won't work.)
    </p>
    <p>

      There are actually two different approaches to this problem that use
      the Product Rule.  The first is to rewrite <m>z</m> as
      <m>x^{\frac12}\inverse{(2-3x^2)}</m> then apply the Product Rule followed
      by the Power Rule.
    </p>
    <p>

      The second approach is to clear the fraction so that
      <m>z(2-3x^2)=\sqrt{x}</m>.  From here we can compute the differential of
      both sides (using the Product Rule on the left side) and solve the
      result for <m>\dx{z}</m>.

  <p>
    Both of the techniques in <xref ref="EXAMPLEQR1">Example~\</xref> are
    straightforward and can be applied to any fractional
    expression. Because this can become a bit cumbersome we will calculate
    <m>\dx\left(\frac{x}{y}\right)</m> once and for all. This will give us
    a convenient shortcut to handle fractional expressions called the
    Quotient Rule.

    Of the six General Differentiation Rules, the Quotient
    Rule is the most complicated to use. Many people try to avoid it when

    We now have all six of the General Differentiation Rules in our toolbox:
    <dl>
      <li>
        <title>The Constant Rule:</title>
        <p>
          If <m>a</m> is a constant, then <m>\dx{a}=0.</m>
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <title>The Sum Rule:</title>
        <p>
          <m>\dx(x+y)=\dx x+\dx y.</m>
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <title>The Constant Multiple Rule:</title>
        <p>
          If <m>a</m> is a constant, then <m>\dx(ax)=a\dx x.</m>
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <title>The Product Rule:</title>
        <p>
          <m>\dx{(xy)}=x\dx{y}+y\dx{x}.</m> -
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <title>The Power Rule:</title>
        <p>
          If <m>n</m> is any real number then, <m>\dx(x^n)=nx^{n-1}\dx{x}</m>.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <title>The Quotient Rule:</title>
        <p>
          <m>\dx{\left(\dfrac{x}{y}\right)}=\dfrac{y\dx{x}-x\dx{y}}{y^2}.</m>
        </p>
      </li>
    </dl>
    We have not yet shown that the Power Rule works when <m>n</m> is
    irrational but we will do that in
    <xref ref="CHAlast-elem-funct">Chapter</xref>.
  </p>
  <p>
    Of these, the Constant Multiple Rule, the Power Rule and the
    Quotient Rule are really just conveniences. They can all be derived
    from the other three.
  </p>
  <p>

    We remind you that the General Differentiation Rules only tell you
    how to compute differentials. They do not tell you what
    differentials you need to compute or why.  Algebra, Geometry,
    Arithmetic, and Trigonometry are still important tools as
    well. Tools are only useful if you are skillful with them, and can
    use them in a coordinated fashion. This requires practice. Lots of
    practice.
