    Commercial transactions were hard to do using Roman numerals. So in
    Europe during the Middle Ages such computations were usually done
    using pebbles on a small table called a

    The board was
    marked off so that placing a pebble here we meant <q>one,</q> there meant
    <q>ten,</q> over there meant <q>a hundred,</q> and so on. Think of an
    abacus. Obviously the only computational skills a merchant needed were
    a thorough knowledge of rules for moving the pebbles and how to read
    the board afterward.

  <p>
    The Latin word for <q>rock</q> or <q>pebble</q> is
    <q>calculus.</q> Thus the English word <q>calculus</q> has come to refer to
    any computational scheme where it was not really necessary to
    understand the computations in order to apply them, at least for basic
    applications.

    Nevertheless it is a calculus in the original sense. That is, it is
    possible to simply memorize the rules for manipulating symbols
    (<q>move the pebbles</q>) and thereby solve a great many otherwise very
    difficult problems without any very deep understanding. There is
    nothing wrong with using Calculus this way.  Indeed, this is
    precisely what it was invented to do. The difficulty is that those
    who learn only to manipulate symbols are in a position similar to
    the merchants of the Middle Ages. They can do the calculations but
    they only understand how to move the pebbles (use
    the notation). If a problem comes up that is outside the reach of
    their pebbles they are completely helpless.
  </p>
  <p>
    This was not a problem for say, Marco Polo. He rarely had to do much
    mathematics besides add, subtract, multiply and divide. A deep
    understanding of these operations is not needed for the simple
    financial transactions of the Middle Ages. However, in the modern
    era such routine, rudimentary computations are done by machines. The
    role of humans is to figure out how to apply the fundamental
    concepts in novel arenas and in novel ways. Simply learning to
    compute, without a deeper understanding of the principles involved,
    is not a foundation upon which a modern education can be
    built. Modern practioners must be flexible, and flexibility comes
    from a deep understanding of principles.
  </p>
  <p>
    As you will soon see many otherwise very difficult problems become
    straightforward, even simple if we know how to manipulate Calculus
    notation (move the pebbles) correctly. So simple in fact, that it
    is easy to confuse the manipulation of notation with
    understanding.  Don<rsq/>t make that mistake.
  </p>
  <p>
    Notation is not mathematics. Notation is simply the best way we<rsq/>ve
    found for representing mathematical ideas and communicating them to
    other people. Notice that we did not say that it is <em>the</em> best
    way. Only that it is the best we<rsq/>ve found so far. Sometimes our
    notation falls short of our needs; sometimes far short. When it does
    only a deep understanding of fundamental concepts will clarify the
    problem for you.
  </p>
  <p>
    Even though the rules for manipulating the notation of Calculus were
    designed to be used blindly, this does not make them unimportant. If
    anything it is more important in the modern era than it has ever
    been that students learn to read the notation with understanding and
    to use the computational rules skillfully because it is through
    mastering these fundamentals that the underlying concepts emerge and
    become clear.
  </p>
  <p>
    So we will begin with the Calculus notation, and the rules for its
    manipulation. But we (your teacher, and the authors of this book)
    cannot master this for you. We are only your guides. You must stay
    focused on understanding not mere computation. The process is
    slow. It takes time and practice and it can be very
    frustrating. Prepare yourself. Arrange your study schedule to give
    yourself as much time for practice as you can possibly manage. Do
    not accept simply <q>getting the right answer</q> as <q>good
    enough.</q> If you can correctly perform some computation but don<rsq/>t
    take the time to understand why that particular manipulation of the
    symbols led you to the <q>right answer</q> then you are wasting your
    time. Your goal is to understand, not to compute.
  </p>
  <p>
    It may surprise you to learn that when it was first invented the
    validity of the Calculus was very suspect.  The underlying ideas
    were very <foreign>ad hoc</foreign> and did not stand up to close scrutiny at
    all.  Indeed, the foundations of the topic were so murky that the
    only reason Calculus remained viable was the simple fact that it
    worked. Or at least, it seemed to.  This was taken as evidence that
    the underlying principles were valid but no one was very comfortable
    with the fact that those principles could not be unambiguously
    stated.  It took about <m>200</m> years to finally work out a supporting
    logical foundation that explained why the symbol manipulations of
    Calculus worked and, perhaps more importantly, when they wouldn<rsq/>t
    work.
  </p>
  <p>
    This text follows the history of our topic. In the first part
    (<alert><q>From Practice  . . .  </q></alert>) we begin with the rules for
    performing Calculus computations <mdash/> we<rsq/>ll learn to move the
    pebbles. When these have been mastered we<rsq/>ll learn to use these
    computational methods to solve some (hopefully) interesting and
    (definitely) substantial problems.
  </p>
  <p>
    We will not address the logical underpinnings of the Calculus until
    the second part (<alert><q>  . . .  To Theory</q></alert>) where we will
    examine the logical support structure that took some the greatest
    minds our species has known almost <m>200</m> years to develop. Naturally
    this will require a shift in our focus.  In the first part of this
    text you will learn how to <em>use</em> Calculus. In the second part
    you will learn why it works the way that it does.
  </p>
  <p>
    This will be hard.  At times it will be very hard. But it is worth
    the effort. At the other end, when it all comes together, there is a
    transcendent beauty to the Calculus which is impossible to convey to
    the uninitiated. A poet once wrote, 

    <url href="https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/148566/euclid-alone-has-looked-on-beauty-bare" visual="https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/148566/euclid-alone-has-looked-on-beauty-bare"><q>Euclid alone has looked on
    beauty bare,</q></url>
    but this is not true. Everyone who has studied and
    understood mathematics beyond the level of moving the pebbles has
    seen the same beauty that Euclid saw. If you have never seen it this
    is your chance.
