  <title>Horizontal Asymptotes: Limits <q>at Infinity</q></title>
  <introduction>
    <p>
      In our fishery model in the previous chapter we referred to the
      carrying capacity of the lake, <m>P=100</m>, as an <q>asymptote.</q>
      Loosely speaking, an asymptote is a line that the graph of a function
      <q>gets close to.</q>  Any
      line can be an asymptote but we will be primarily interested in
      horizontal asymptotes (lines like the graph of <m>y=5</m>) and vertical
      asymptotes (lines like the graph of <m>x=5</m>).
    </p>

    <p>
      Take another look at the graph of the Witch of Agnesi below.  You
      can readily see that, as <m>x</m> moves to the right <m>y</m> gets
      <q>closer and closer</q> to zero. This is the essential idea but the
      phrase <q>closer and closer</q> is too vague for our purpose.
    </p>
    <image source="DC/Witch10.png" width="90%"/>


    <p>
      Here<rsq/>s why. In the sketch below, suppose <m>x</m> is moving
      to the right in such a way that comes as close as we like to
      <m>a</m> bud never exceeds <m>a</m> . Clearly
      <m>x</m> gets <q>closer and closer</q> to <m>a</m>. But it also
      gets <q>closer and closer</q> to both <m>b</m> and <m>c</m>.
    </p>

    <image source="DC/CloserCloser.png" width="60%" />

    <p>
      While <m>x</m> is getting <q>closer and closer</q> to all three of
      <m>a</m>, <m>b</m>, and <m>c</m> it is only getting <q>arbitrarily
      close</q> to <m>a</m>, and <q>arbitrarily close</q> is what we
      usually mean when we say <q>closer and closer.</q> When <m>x</m> is
      getting <q>arbitrarily close</q> to <m>a</m> we say that <m>x</m>
      approaches <m>a</m> and we write <m>x\rightarrow a</m>.
    </p>
    <aside>
      <title>Mathematical Terminology</title>
      <p>
        The phrase <q>arbitrarily close</q> will be adequate for our present
        purposes but eventually even that will not be sufficiently
        precise. The need for precise language is real and very delicate.
        We will return to this matter <xref
        ref="SECTIONLimitLaws">Chapter</xref>. For now be aware that we are
        not quite done perfecting the meaning of <q>arbitrarily close.</q>

      </p>
    </aside>


    <p>
      It is clear that the graph of the Witch comes arbitrarily close to
      the line <m>y=0</m> so we write <m>y\rightarrow0</m> as
      <m>x\rightarrow\infty</m>. This is spoken aloud as <q><m>y</m>
      approaches zero as <m>x</m> approaches infinity.</q>
    </p>
  </introduction>


  <subsection xml:id="DIGRESSIONLimitNotation">
    <title>Limit Notation</title>
    <p>
      Of course, the notion of <q>approaching infinity</q> is troublesome
      as well. That we speak in this fashion has more to do with the
      construction of the English language than with the mathematics we
      want to
      represent. If <m>y</m> is proceeding toward zero (an actual
      number) it makes sense to say <q><m>y</m> approaches zero.</q> The
      notation <q><m>y\rightarrow0</m></q> captures this idea nicely. And
      since we usually pronounce the symbol <m>\infty</m> as
      <q>infinity</q> it feels natural to write <m>x\rightarrow\infty</m>
      and to speak this aloud as <q><m>x</m> approaches infinity</q> as if
      <m>\infty</m> is a place we could get to. But as we<rsq/>ve observed,
      this is absurd.  Properly speaking the symbols
      <q><m>x\rightarrow\infty</m></q> should be spoken aloud as
      <q><m>x</m> increases without bound,</q> but nearly everyone says
      <q><m>x</m> approaches infinity</q> instead because it is a less
      cumbersome phrase. Like so much of mathematics this is perfectly
      clear once the underlying ideas have been internalized, but in the
      beginning it is can be quite confusing. Be patient with yourself.
    </p>
    <p>
      
      An alternative, and more common notation is:
      <me>
        \tlimit{x}{\infty}{\frac{1}{1+x^2}}=0
      </me>
      which we read aloud as <q>The limit as <m>x</m> approaches infinity of one
      over one plus <m>x</m> squared is equal to zero</q> but this also collides
      with the construction of the English language.  From the discussion
      above we know that <q><m>x\rightarrow\infty</m></q> indicates that <m>x</m>
      increases without bound, but when we write
      <m>\tlimit{x}{\infty}{\frac{1}{1+x^2}}=0</m> what exactly does
      <q><m>=0</m></q> mean? What is equal to zero? Certainly the Witch is never
      equal to zero since its graph never crosses (or even touches) the
      <m>x</m> axis.
    </p>
    <p>
      <idx><h>Vocabulary</h><h>limit</h></idx>
      The expression <m>\tlimit{x}{\infty}{\frac{1}{1+x^2}}=0</m> is making a
      very specific statement, one that is difficult to capture in a
      natural language like English. It says that the expression
      <m>\frac{1}{1+x^2}</m> is approaching a particular value (zero) as
      <m>x</m> approaches <m>\infty</m>. The equals sign doesn<rsq/>t indicate
      that the function, <m>\frac{1}{1+x^2}</m> actually equals that
      value.  Instead it is the <term>limit</term> of <m>\frac{1}{1+x^2}</m> which is
      equal to zero.  Whether the function itself is ever equal to the
      limit, or not, is irrelevant. We<rsq/>re interested in what it gets
      arbitrarily close
      to.
    </p>
    <p>
      
      We are treading at the edge of some very deep waters here so we will
      not attempt to address all of the nuances yet. Instead we will
      simply interpret the formula <m>\tlimit{x}{\infty}{\frac{1}{1+x^2}}=0</m>
      to mean that as <m>x</m> approaches infinity (<m>x\rightarrow\infty</m>) the expression
      <m>\frac{1}{1+x^2}</m> approaches zero  <m>\left(\frac{1}{1+x^2}\rightarrow0\right)</m>.
    </p>

    <p>
      In <xref ref="CHAPTERformal-limits">Chapter</xref> we will replace
      <q>arbitrarily close</q> with something much more precise. Indeed,
      finding a better way to say <q>arbitrarily close</q> will be the
      culmination of our efforts. This is what will allow us to finally
      replace differentials with a solid theoretical foundation.
    </p>

    <p>
      But for now, we have enough to give our first definition of the
      limit concept.

    <example xml:id="EXAMPLELimWitch">
      <p>
        As we<rsq/>ve observed, for very large positive values of <m>x</m>, the function
        <m>W(x)=\frac{1}{1+x^2}</m> will be close to zero (the larger the <m>x</m>
        value, the closer <m>\frac{1}{1+x^2}</m> is to zero).

        Likewise, for very
        large, negative values of <m>x</m>, <m>W(x)</m> will also get close to zero so:
        <me>\limit{x}{-\infty}{\frac{1}{1+x^2}}=\limit{x}{\infty}{\frac{1}{1+x^2}}=0.</me>
      </p>
    </example>

    <p>
      We used the Witch for our first example because we are  quite
      familiar with its properties from our earlier
      investigations. However we needn<rsq/>t have started with so complex a
      function.

      The limit concept is deeply abstract.  We are
      introducing it here because, (1) the limit idea gives us a handy way to define
      asymptotes, and (2) when we return to it in
      <xref ref="CHAPTERformal-limits">Chapter</xref> it will be helpful if you are
      comfortable with the notation and the essential underlying idea.

      From <xref ref="PROBLEMLimConst"></xref> we know

      <p>
        State the theorem corresponding to each of <xref
        ref="THEOREMLimSum1" ></xref>, <xref ref="THEOREMLimProd1">
        </xref> and <xref ref="THEOREMLimQuot1"> </xref> where the
        limit is taken as goes to negative infinity.

    </problem>


    <example xml:id="EXAMPLENonexistantLimits">
      <p>
        Notice that in <xref ref="THEOREMLimQuot1"></xref> we specifically
        required that <m>\limit{x}{\infty}{g(x)}=M\neq0</m>. This is
        necessary because, as we stated quite emphatically in <xref
        ref="DIGRESSIONDivideByZero" text="custom">Digression: Dividing by Zero</xref>,
        division by zero is an undefined concept. Thus if
        <m>\limit{x}{\infty} {f(x)}</m> is equal to, say <m>1</m>, and
        <m>\limit{x}{\infty}{g(x)}=0</m> then
        <me>
          \frac{\tlimit{x}{\infty}{f(x)}}{\tlimit{x}{\infty}{g(x)}}
        </me>
        appears to be equal to <m>\frac{1}{0}.</m> But this is
        meaningless, so we say that <m> \limit{x}{\infty}
        {\frac{f(x)}{g(x)}}</m> does not exist, or equivalently that
        it is undefined.
      </p>
    </example>

    <p>
      Like the differentiation rules, when these limit theorems are used together
      they allow us to break a large problem into smaller, more tractable,
      pieces. Here are some examples.
    </p>
    <example>
      <p>
        We<rsq/>d like to find the horizontal asymptotes of
        <m>y=\frac{2}{x}-\frac{3}{x^2}</m> if any exist.
        
        In this example we will write down all of the details of our
        computation. As you get more comfortable, you will probably
        abbreviate the process by doing much of this in your
        head. That<rsq/>s good, but also be sure you can fill in all of
        the details when needed. You will need to be comfortable with all
        of the details when the problems get more complex.
        
        From <xref ref="DEFINITIONHorizontalAsymptotes"></xref> we see that if
        horizontal asymptotes exist they will be the lines
        <m>y=\limit{x}{\infty}{\left(\frac{2}{x}-\frac{3}{x^2}\right)}</m> and
        <m>y=\limit{x}{-\infty}{\left(\frac{2}{x}-\frac{3}{x^2}\right)}</m> so we
        need to evaluate these limits. For the first limit we see from
        <xref ref="THEOREMLimSum1"></xref> that
        <me>
          \limit{x}{\infty}{\left(\frac{2}{x}-\frac{3}{x^2}\right)}=\limit{x}{\infty}{\frac{2}{x}}-\limit{x}{\infty}{\frac{3}{x^2}}.
        </me>
        Applying <xref ref="THEOREMLimProd1"></xref> (several times) we have

        <md>
          <mrow>
            \limit{x}{\infty}{\left(\frac{2}{x}-\frac{3}{x^2}\right)} 
            =\amp{}\underbrace{\left(\limit{x}{\infty}{2}\right)}_{=2}\cdot\underbrace{\left(\limit{x}{\infty}{\frac{1}{x}}\right)}_{=0}
          </mrow>
          <mrow>
            \amp{}-\underbrace{\left(\limit{x}{\infty}{3}\right)}_{=3}\cdot\underbrace{\left(\limit{x}{\infty}{\frac{1}{x}}\right)}_{=0}\cdot\underbrace{\left(\limit{x}{\infty}{\frac{1}{x}}\right)}_{=0}
          </mrow>
        </md>
        So we see that the  horizontal asymptote will be <m>y=0.</m>

      Of course, not every curve has a horizontal asymptote so not every
      function has a limit as <m>x</m> approaches <m>\pm\infty</m>.  For example,
      consider the curves <m>y=x^2</m> and <m>y=x^3.</m> 
    </p>
    <image source="DC/asymptotes3.png" width="90%"/>
    <p>
      Clearly these curves have no horizontal asymptotes because
      as
      <m>x\rightarrow\pm\infty</m> they don<rsq/>t get close to a real number. In fact
      they either continue to rise or continue to drop as <m>x\rightarrow\pm\infty</m>.

      <title>Mathematical Notation</title>

        Notice that we have used the plus-or-minus (<m>\pm</m>) symbol to
        combine two limits into a single expression. There is no special
        meaning to this notation. We are just saving space on the page.

      We represent this with the notation:
      <ul cols="2">
        <li>
          <m>\limit{x}{\infty}{x^2}=\infty,</m>
        </li>

        <li><m> \limit{x}{-\infty}{x^3}=-\infty.</m>
        </li>
      </ul>

      But once again we need to keep in mind that the symbol <q><m>\infty</m></q>
      does not represent a number so saying that something is <q>equal</q> to
      <m>\infty</m> is meaningless.

          Similarly <m>\limit{x}{-\infty}{x^3}=-\infty</m> means
          that as <m>x\rightarrow-\infty</m> <m>x^3\rightarrow-\infty</m>.
          How would we say this in words?

      </statement>

        It is especially important to keep in mind that <m>\infty</m> is
        not a number when evaluating a limit like:
        <m>
          \limit{x}{\infty}{(x^3-21x^2)}.
        </m>
      </p>
      <p>
        It is very tempting to attack this problem by noticing that each
        term is increasing without bound and write <m>\infty-\infty=0,</m>
        but in fact this limit is not zero. Can you see what the limit is?
        Give it some thought and take your best guess. We<rsq/>ll come
        back to it shortly.
      </p>
    </example>

    <p>
      It is very clear that the limit: <m>\limit{x}{\infty}{(x-x)}</m>
      is zero. After all, <m>x-x</m> is constantly equal to zero so we
      have <m> \limit{x}{\infty}{(x-x)} = \limit{x}{\infty}{0} =
      0</m>. So it seems to be clear that <m>\limit{x}{\infty}{(x-x)}
      = \infty-\infty = 0</m> because anything minus itself has to be
      zero doesn<rsq/>t it? Even grandmother - grandmother must be
      zero, right?
    </p>

    <p>
      But now consider this limit:
      <me>\limit{x}{\infty}{[(x+7)-(x-5)]}</me>. Both
      <m>(x+7)\rightarrow\infty</m> and <m>(x-5)\rightarrow\infty</m>
      so <m>\limit{x}{\infty}{\left[(x+7)-(x-5)\right]}</m> also has
      the form <m>\infty-\infty</m> doesn<rsq/>t it? But
      <m>(x+7)-(x-5)</m> is constantly equal to <m>12</m> so, we have
      <me>\limit{x}{\infty}{[(x+7)-(x-5)]}=\limit{x}{\infty}{12}=12.</me>
      Thus it appears that if <m>\infty-\infty</m> is a number then it
      is zero, <em>and</em> that if <m>\infty-\infty</m> is a number
      then it is <m>12</m>. But <m>0\neq12</m> so that can<rsq/>t be!
      Moreover there is nothing special about the numbers <m>12</m> or
      <m>0</m>. We could have chosen any numbers to make our point.
      We conclude that as a number the expression <m>\infty-\infty</m>
      is meaningless. Equivalently, we say it is undefined.
    </p>


    <p>
      The source of the difficulty here is that only numbers can be
      subtracted. But neither <m>\infty</m> nor grandmother is a number
      so the expressions <m>\infty-\infty</m> and grandmother -
      grandmother are utter nonsense. Which is to say, they are
      undefined.

        Your teacher will tell you, if you ask, that we aren<rsq/>t
        being entirely honest here. Mathematicians routinely add,
        subtract, multiply, and divide lots of things that you
        probably would not recognize as numbers. But <m>\infty </m>
        and grandmother are usually not among them. Moreover, if in some
        context we are impelled to give a meaning to the (apparent)
        subtraction of non-numbers we must first define very carefully
        what we mean by <q>subtraction</q> in that context.

      Limits can be deceptive so be careful. It can be helpful to have
      built in notational cues to remind ourselves that these are subtle
      problems. When we are working with limits we will use the notation
      <m>\approach{\infty}</m> to remind ourselves that <m>\infty</m> is
      not a number.
    </p>

    <p>
      Returning to the limit <m> \limit{x}{\infty}{(x^3-21x^2)} </m> and
      using this notational cue we have
      <me>
        \limit{x}{\infty}{(x^3-21x^2)} = \approach{\infty} -
        \approach{\infty}.

    <aside>
      <title>Mathematical Notation</title>
      <p>
        The expression <m>\approach{\infty}</m> is not a standard notation so you
        probably won<rsq/>t see it anywhere except in this textbook. No
        matter. Once you master the underlying idea, the particular
        notation being used isn<rsq/>t so important.
      </p>

    <p>
      This says that the limit consists of something which is approaching
      <m>\infty</m> (increasing without bound) minus something else which
      is approaching <m>\infty</m> (again, increasing without bound). When
      we say it like this <mdash/> more importantly when we think about it
      like this <mdash/> we can see that the value of the limit will
      depend upon precisely how the two parts increase without bound.

      <idx><h>Vocabulary</h><h>Indeterminate Form</h></idx>
      Limits which appear to resolve to an

      <term>indeterminate forms</term>. Some indeterminate forms can

      Rule in
      <xref ref="SECTIONIndetFormsAndLhop"></xref>. But unfortunately

      We now know that this limit is not necessarily equal to zero, but

        No, of course not. The expression <m>\frac{\infty}{\infty}</m> is

        <p>
          Do you think the function <m>y(x) = \sqrt{x^2+2}-\sqrt{x^2+x}</m>
          has any horizontal asymptotes? Take your best guess before we
          begin this example.
          
          To find any horizontal asymptotes we have to evaluate the two
          limits
          <me>
            \limit{x}{\pm\infty}{\left(\sqrt{x^2+2}-\sqrt{x^2+x}\right)}.
          </me>
          First we<rsq/>ll find the limit as <m>x\rightarrow\infty</m> and leave the limit as
          <m>x\rightarrow-\infty</m> as a drill  for you.
        </p>
        <p>    
          As always the trick is to rearrange this expression inside the
          limit algebraically <mdash/> without changing its value <mdash/>
          until we can see clearly what happens as
          <m>x\rightarrow\infty</m>.
          The square roots seem to be the difficulty here. So we<rsq/>d like
          to find a way to make them go away. The standard trick for this is
          to multiply by the conjugate  of <m>\sqrt{x^2+2}-\sqrt{x^2+x}</m>, namely
          <m>\sqrt{x^2+2}+\sqrt{x^2+x}</m>.
        </p>
        <aside>
          <title>Comment</title>
          <p>
            We are using the identity <m>(A-B)(A+B)=A^2-B^2</m> to square both
            terms and get rid of the square roots. The factors <m>A+B</m> and
            <m>A-B</m> are mutually conjugate.
          </p>
        </aside>

        <p>
          Of course, if we do that then
          we need to divide by the conjugate as well. That way we<rsq/>ve
          multiplied by <m>1</m> and have not changed the value of the
          expression. This won<rsq/>t actually eliminate the square roots as
          we will still have them in the denominator. But let<rsq/>s see
          what happens.

<title>The Squeeze Theorem</title>

<p>

It is clear from the graph below that
<m>\limit{x}{\infty}{\sin(x)}</m> does not exist since the
<m>\sin(x)</m> has no horizontal asymptotes.  To say that this limit
does not exist means that <m>y=\sin(x)</m> is not approaching any
particular value as <m>x\rightarrow\infty</m>. It<rsq/>s not even
<q>approaching</q> <m>+\infty</m> or <m>-\infty</m> since it is
bounded both above and below.
</p>
<image source="DC/asymptotes44.png" width="70%"/>

<p>
Now how about this limit: <me>\tlimit{x}{\infty}{\frac{\sin(x)}{x}}?</me>

Since<m>\limit{x}{\infty}{\sin(x)}</m> does not exist we can<rsq/>t apply
<xref ref="THEOREMLimQuot1">Theorem</xref>.  Neither is it of the form
<m>\frac{\approach{\infty}}{\approach{\infty}},</m> so none of the
techniques we<rsq/>ve used before will help us.
</p>

<p>
We need a new idea.
</p>

<p>
Look at the graph of <m>f(x) = \frac{\sin(x)}{x}</m>:
</p>
  
<image source="DC/asymptotes5.png" width="90%" />


<p>
Can you see that the horizontal asymptote is <m>y=0</m>?
</p>
<p>

It certainly looks like <m>y=0</m> is an asymptote in both
directions which seems to
suggest that
<me> \tlimit{x}{\infty}{\frac{\sin(x)}{x}} =
  \tlimit{x}{-\infty}{\frac{\sin(x)}{x}} = 0</me>.
This is correct, but is there a way to see this algebraically? After
all, this graph could just as easily support the conclusion that
<m>y=0.00000001</m> (or <m>y=</m> any other number which is extremely close to
zero) is the asymptote. We don<rsq/>t want to draw conclusions from a
picture, but it is difficult to see what we can do, isn<rsq/>t it?
</p>

<p>
  We will analyze what happens when <m>x\rightarrow\infty</m> and leave the
  case <m>x\rightarrow-\infty</m> for you in <xref ref="PROBLEMSinOverXSqThmNeg"></xref>.
</p>

<p>
  Let<rsq/>s <q>disassemble</q> our function in order to understand it
  better. The function <m>f(x)=\frac{\sin(x)}{x}</m> clearly comes in
  two parts: <m>\sin(x)</m> and <m>\frac{1}{x}</m>.



  Because <me>-1\le\sin(x)\le1</me> we know that
  <me>-\frac{1}{x}\le\frac{\sin(x)}{x}\le\frac1x.</me>
  If we graph
  <m>y=\frac{\sin(x)}{x}</m>, <m>y=\frac1x</m>, and <m>y=-\frac1x</m>
  together as in the sketch below  we see that for positive
  values of <m>x</m> the graph of <m>y=\frac{\sin(x)}{x}</m> is always
  caught between the graph of <m>y=\frac1x</m> and <m>y=-\frac1x</m>, as seen below.
</p>
<image source="DC/asymptotes13.png" width="50%"/>

<p>
 We know that both <m>\pm\frac1x\rightarrow0</m> as
 <m>x\rightarrow\infty</m>.  Since <m>\frac{\sin(x)}{x}</m> is caught
 between <m>\frac1x</m> and <m>-\frac1x</m> it follows that, for
 positive values of <m>x</m>, the highest and lowest points on the
 graph of <m>\frac{\sin(x)}{x}</m> must also approach zero as <m>x
 \rightarrow\infty</m>. Therefore
 <m>\tlimit{x}{\infty}{\frac{\sin(x)}{x}}=0</m>.
</p>

<p>

  In the previous example, notice that we had
  <m>\frac{-1}{x}\le \frac{\sin(x)}{x}\le\frac1x</m> for all <m>x\neq0</m>, but
this is more than is actually required. We only need for the
inequality to be satisfied when <m>x</m> sufficiently large, in either the
positive or negative direction. That<rsq/>s why we only require that
<m>\alpha(x)\le f(x)\le \beta(x)</m> on the interval <m>(c,\infty)</m> (positive
case) or <m>(-\infty,c)</m> (negative case) rather than for all values of
<m>x</m>.

  <p>
    It should be clear from the sketch below that in addition to

    has a vertical asymptote of <m>x=0</m>.
  </p>
  <image source="DC/VerticalAsymp3.png" width="50%"/>

  <p>
    We can extend the ideas and the notation we<rsq/>ve developed for
    horizontal asymptotes to handle vertical asymptotes as well. First
    note that since the expression <m>\frac1x</m> is not defined for <m>x=0</m> we
    can<rsq/>t talk about the behavior of the function at zero. But we
    can talk about its behavior near zero, and notice the graph is very
    different depending on whether <m>x\lt0</m> or <m>x\gt0</m>.  We will focus
    first on positive values of <m>x</m>.
  </p>
  <p>

    For <m>x</m> near zero, and positive, it is very clear what is happening.
    As <m>x\rightarrow0</m> the function continues to increase without bound.
    We capture this notationally with

    The limit in <xref ref="EQUATIONRightHandLimit">equation</xref> is called a
    <term>right<ndash/>hand limit</term> and is read aloud as <q>the limit as <m>x</m>
    approaches zero from the right, of one over <m>x</m> equals infinity.</q>
  </p>
  <p>


    The expression
    <m>x\rightarrow0</m> means that <m>x</m>  is approaching the number zero. The
    qualification <m>x\gt0</m> specifies that it is approaching from the right.
    So writing<m>\limitX{x}{0}{\frac1x}{x\gt0}=\infty</m>  means 
    that as <m>x\rightarrow0</m> from the right, the function <m>\frac1x</m>
    increases without bound.

    <title>One-Sided  Limits vs.  Limits</title>

      Notice that so far in this section  we have only discussed one-sided
      limits like
      
      <md>
        <mrow>
          \llimit{x}{a}{f(x)} =\pm\infty \amp{}\amp{} \text{and}
          \amp{}\amp{}\rlimit{x}{a}{f(x)}=\pm\infty,
        </mrow>
      </md>
      but we have carefully avoided assigning any meaning to a
      formula like 

      <mdn>
        <mrow xml:id="EQUATIONPosNegInfLimits">
          \limit{x}{a}{f(x)}=\infty \amp{}\amp{} \text{or} \amp{}\amp{}
          \limit{x}{a}{f(x)}=-\infty.
        </mrow>
      </mdn>

      This is not because the topic is inherently
      difficult.  We<rsq/>re just  not quite ready to     discuss it
      yet.
    </p>
    <p>
      In fact, at this point you can probably guess the meanings of the
      expressions in  <xref

      from us.

    <title>L<rsq/>Hôpital<rsq/>s Rule</title>


    <p>
      Based on our experience so far it is tempting to conclude that we
      can locate vertical asymptotes by simply setting the denominator
      equal to zero and solving.  But this is a naive conclusion as we
      will see next.
    </p>

    <example xml:id="EXAMPLEVertAsymp">
      <p>
        Consider <m>y=\frac{x-2}{x^2-4}</m>.  Setting the denominator equal
        to zero yields <m>x=-2</m> and <m>x=2</m>, but only one of these is
        a vertical asymptote. Do you see which one?

      </p>

      <p>
        Let<rsq/>s take a careful look at this example.  By
        <xref ref="DEFINITIONVerticalAsymptotes">Definition</xref> we will have a vertical
        asymptote when either one-sided limit of a function increases or
        decreases without bound, so we must evaluate each one-sided limit.
      </p>

      <p>
        For <m>x=-2</m>, we have
        <md>
          <mrow>\limitX{x}{-2}{\frac{x-2}{x^2-4}}{x\gt -2}
          \amp{}=\limitX{x}{-2}{\frac{x-2}{(x-2)(x+2)}}{x\gt -2}</mrow>
          <mrow>\amp{}=\limitX{x}{-2}{\cancelto{=1}{\left(\frac{x-2}{x-2}\right)}}{x\gt -2}\,\,\cdot\,\,\limitX{x}{-2}{\frac{1}{x+2}}{x\gt -2}</mrow>
          <mrow>\amp{}= 1\cdot\frac{1}{\approach{0}} =\infty</mrow>
        </md>
        So the line <m>x=-2</m> is indeed a vertical asymptote.
      </p>
    </example>

    <problem>
      <statement>

        </p>
      </statement>
    </problem>

    <p>
      We were careful to use one-sided limits to find the vertical
      asymptote at <m>x= -2</m> because this is what <xref
      ref="DEFINITIONVerticalAsymptotes"></xref> calls for. Strictly
      speaking we only needed one of them, but since these limits were not
      equal we evaluated them both.
    </p>

    <p>
      However, for <m>x=2</m>, both one-sided limits are the same so we
      have
      <md>
        <mrow>\limit{x}{2}{\frac{x-2}{x^2-4}}=\limit{x}{2}{\frac{x-2}{(x-2)(x+2)}}
        \amp{}=\cancelto{=1}{\left(\limit{x}{2}{\frac{x-2}{x-2}}\right)}\,\,\cdot\,\,\left(\limit{x}{2}{\frac{1}{x+2}}\right)</mrow>
        <mrow>\amp{}=\approach{1}\cdot\approach{\frac14}</mrow>
        <mrow>\amp{}=\frac{1}{4}.</mrow>
      </md>
    </p>

    <problem>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Confirm <m>\tlimitX{x}{2}{\frac{x-2}{x^2-4}}{x\gt2}=\frac14</m> and
          <m>\tlimitX{x}{2}{\frac{x-2}{x^2-4}}{x\lt2}=\frac14</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </problem>

    <p>
      Observe that this limit has the form
      <m>\limit{x}{2}{\frac{x-2}{x^2-4}}=\frac{\approach{0}}{\approach{0}}</m>.
      A limit of this form is  another <term>indeterminate
      Form</term>  like <m>\approach{\infty -\infty }</m>.

    <aside>
      <title>Comment</title>
      <p>
We
will encounter them later in this chapter. Remember that
<q>indeterminate</q> does not mean undefined. It means that they must
be addressed on a case<ndash/>by<ndash/>case basis, and their value is
often surprising. For example, would you have guessed that
<m>\limit{x}{2}{\frac{x-2}{x^2-4}}=2</m>?

      <xref ref="EXAMPLEVertAsymp"></xref> demonstrates that a function
      which does not exist at a point is a more general concept than a
      function with a vertical asymptote at a point. 
    </p>
    <aside>
      <title>Mathematical Terminology</title>
      <p>
        A function with a vertical asymptote fails to exist. but it fails in a
        very particular manner. It increases (or decreases) without
        bound. Speaking colloquially, we say that it 
        <q>blows up</q> at the point
      </p>
    </aside>

    <p>
      Notice that <m>g(x)=\frac{x-2}{x^2-4}</m> is undefined at both
      <m>x=2</m> and <m>x=-2</m>, but it only has an asymptote at
      <m>x=-2</m>.  It also displays something subtle about limits.  One
      would be tempted to say that
      <me>
        \frac{x-2}{x^2-4}=\frac{x-2}{(x-2)(x+2)}=\frac{1}{x+2},
      </me>
      and this is true when <m>x\neq2</m>.  However, if we graph the two
      functions, <m>g(x)=\frac{x-2}{x^2-4}</m> and
      <m>f(x)=\frac{1}{x+2}</m> we see that there is a small difference
      between them:
    </p>
    <image source="DC/lhopital2.png" width="80%" />

    
    <p>
      Do you see the difference?  The value of <m>g(2)</m> is
      not defined because <m>g(2)=\frac{2-2}{4-4}</m> and we get a zero
      denominator. But no such difficulty occurs with <m>f</m> because
      <m>f(2) = \frac{1}{2+2}=\frac14</m>.
    </p>
    <aside>
      <title>Comment</title>
      <p>
        This discussion is also a cautionary tale about the use of graphing
        technology. These two graphs appear to be identical when we use
        technology to graph them.
      </p>
    </aside>

    <p>
      So, when <m>x\neq2</m>, <m>g(x)</m> and <m>f(x)</m> are the exactly
      the same. But they disagree when <m>x=2</m>. More precisely
      <m>x=2</m> is not in the domain of <m>g(x)</m> but it is in the
      domain of <m>f(x)</m>. Since the domains differ they must be
      different functions and it is incorrect to write
      <m>\frac{x-2}{x^2-4}=\frac{1}{x+2}</m> even though it is true for
      all but one value of <m>x</m>.

    <p>
      We found earlier that
      <m>\tlimit{x}{\infty}{\frac{\sin(x)}{x}}=0</m>, so the function
      <m>y=\frac{\sin(x)}{x}</m> must have a horizontal asymptote at
      <m>y=0</m>. Clearly <m>y=\frac{\sin(x)}{x}</m> is undefined at
      <m>x=0</m>.  Does its graph have a vertical asymptote at <m>x=0</m>?
      Take your best guess.
    </p>
    <p>
      To answer this question we need to evaluate the limit
      <m>\tlimit{x}{0}{\frac{\sin(x)}{x}}</m>. But how can we do that?  If
      we try the obvious ploy of just <q>plugging in</q> zero for <m>x</m>
      we get the indeterminate form
      <m>\frac{(\rightarrow0)}{(\rightarrow0)}</m>, and we know we need to
      proceed cautiously with an indeterminate form.
    </p>

    <p>
      From the graph of <m>\frac{\sin(x) }{x}</m> (in the sketch below) it
      would appear that <m>\frac{\sin(x)}{x}\rightarrow1</m> as
      <m>x\rightarrow0</m>. This is correct, but we<rsq/>ve learned to be
      wary of relying on graphs.  It would be best to evaluate the limit
      by another technique if possible.

      Can we apply some algebraic trick like we did in <xref ref="EXAMPLEVertAsymp"></xref>?
    </p>

    <p>
      It is hard to see what it would be.  There isn<rsq/>t much algebra
      we can do here.  If there were other trigonometric functions
      involved we might be able to employ some trigonometric identity in
      the numerator, but there just isn<rsq/>t much we can do with
      <m>\sin(x)</m>. This problem poses a bit more of a challenge than
      the indeterminate forms we have dealt with so far. We need a new
      idea.
    </p>

    <p>
      Since the <m>\sin(x)</m> isn<rsq/>t helping maybe we can replace it
      with something simpler. Seriously.  Give some thought to what might
      be a valid replacement before reading on. Remember that we<rsq/>re
      really only interested in values of <m>x</m> that are very close
      (infinitely close?) to zero.

      Since we are evaluating the limit at <m>x=2</m> we will replace the

      <me>
        \limit{x}{2}{\frac{x^3-8}{x^2-4}}\overset{?}{=}\limit{x}{2}{\frac{12(x-2)}{4(x-2)}}=\limit{x}{2}{\frac{12}{4}}=3.

    <p>
      For comparison we<rsq/>ll also evaluate this one by methods
      we<rsq/>ve used before. Specifically if we factor the numerator and
      denominator we get:
      <md>
        <mrow>    \limit{x}{2}{\frac{x^3-8}{x^2-4}}=
        \limit{x}{2}{\frac{\textcolor{red}{(x-2)}(x^2+2x+4)}{\textcolor{red}{(x-2)}(x+2)}}\amp{}=
        \limit{x}{2}{\frac{x^2+2x+4}{x+2}}</mrow>
        <mrow>\amp{}=
        \frac{2^2+2\cdot2+4}{2+2}</mrow>

      In all of our examples where the indeterminate form was a

      functions such that <m>f(a)=g(a)=0</m> then
      <m>\limit{x}{a}{\frac{f(x)}{g(x)}}</m> is an indeterminate form.

      This is consistent with all of our examples above so it appears that

      All of the evidence we<rsq/>ve gathered so far suggests rather strongly
      that when we are faced with the indeterminate form
      <m>\frac{(\rightarrow0)}{(\rightarrow0)}</m> simply replacing the numerator
      and denominator with their tangent lines will work.

      Now look back at the examples in this section and notice the

    <p>
      We want to emphasize very strongly that L<rsq/>Hôpital<rsq/>s
      Rule requires a L<rsq/>Hôpital indeterminate. If we don<rsq/>t
      have a L<rsq/>Hôpital indeterminate we can not use
      L<rsq/>Hôpital<rsq/>s Rule.  If you try to use
      L<rsq/>Hôpital<rsq/>s Rule when it does not apply, you will
      probably not get the correct answer.  The difficulty here is
      that nothing in the computations will alert you that anything
      has gone wrong. You have to be watchful for this potential
      pitfall.
    </p>

    <example>
      <p>
        For example, if we mistakenly try to use L<rsq/>Hôpital<rsq/>s Rule,
        on
        <m>
          \limit{x}{1}{\frac{x+1}{x+2}}
          </m> we
          will obtain <m>\limit{x}{1}{\frac{1}{1}}=1</m>, but this  is obviously
          incorrect.

    <example>
      <p>
        <xref ref="THEOREMLHRule1"></xref>  is useful but it is much too limited, so
        to speak. For example, it does not help us with this limit:
        <m>\tlimit{x}{0}{\frac{\cos(3x)-1}{\cos(5x)-1}}</m>. Even though it is a L<rsq/>Hôpital
        indeterminate, when we apply   <xref ref="THEOREMLHRule1"></xref>  we have
        <me>
          \limit{x}{0}{\frac{\cos(3x)-1}{\cos(5x)-1}} \lhopeq
          {\frac{-3\sin(3\cdot0)}{-5\sin(5\cdot0)}} = \frac{0}{0}
        </me>
        This is useless because <m>\frac{0}{0}</m> is still not defined.

      </p>
      <p>
        
        We need to think about this again. It is true that <m>\frac{0}{0}</m> is
        not defined, but if
        <me>
          f^\prime(a)=\limit{x}{a}{f^\prime(x)}=0
        </me>
        and
        <me>
          g^\prime(a)=\limit{x}{a}{g^\prime(x)}=0.
        </me>
        then <m>\limit{x}{a}{\frac{f^\prime(x)}{g^\prime(x)}}</m> is a L<rsq/>Hôpital
        Indeterminate so we extend
        <xref ref="THEOREMLHRule1"></xref> as follows:

      Our derivation of <xref ref="THEOREMLHRule2"></xref> is not entirely
      rigorous. We will not be providing a fully rigorous derivation of
      L<rsq/>Hôpital<rsq/>s Rule because doing so is both difficult to produce
      and to understand. There are deep foundational issues involved and
      investigating these would take us too far from our primary purpose,
      gaining proficiency with its use.

      Returning to our example and using <xref ref="THEOREMLHRule2"></xref> this time
      we have

        \lhopeq\limit{x}{0}{\frac{-3\sin(3x)}{-5\sin(5x)}}.
      </me>
      The limit on the right is yet another L<rsq/>Hôpital Indeterminate so we
      apply L<rsq/>Hôpital<rsq/>s Rule again.

  <subsection xml:id="SUBSECTIONlhop-rule-horiz">
    <title>L<rsq/>Hôpital<rsq/>s Rule and Horizontal Asymptotes</title>

    <p>
      Our discovery of L<rsq/>Hôpital<rsq/>s Rule grew from our investigation of
      vertical asymptotes.  Is there any way that we can extend
      L<rsq/>Hôpital<rsq/>s Rule to help us with horizontal asymptotes?  For
      example, consider
      <me>
        \tlimit{x}{\infty}{\frac{\sin\left(\frac{2}{x}\right)}{\sin\left(\frac{3}{x}\right)}}.
      </me>
    </p>

    <p>
      This limit is indeterminate of the form
      <m>\frac{(\rightarrow0)}{(\rightarrow0)}</m>, so it seems like
      L<rsq/>Hôpital<rsq/>s Rule would apply. But both versions of
      L<rsq/>Hôpital<rsq/>s Rule (so far) require that <m>x\rightarrow
      a,</m> where <m>a</m> is a real number. And of course, infinity
      still insists on not being a number, real or otherwise.  If we want
      to use L<rsq/>Hôpital<rsq/>s Rule we<rsq/>ll have to find a way to
      modify this limit so that L<rsq/>Hôpital<rsq/>s Rule does apply.
    </p>

    <p>
      If we make the substitution <m>z=\frac{1}{x}</m> then as
      <m>x\rightarrow\infty</m>,
      <m>\underset{z>0}{z\rightarrow0}</m>.
    </p>
    <aside>
      <title>Notation</title>
      <p>
        Since <m>x\rightarrow\infty</m> through positive values
        we need to constrain <m>z</m> to do the same.
      </p>
    </aside>

    <p>
      After substituting we
      have
      <me>
        \tlimit{x}{\infty}{\frac{\sin\left(\frac{2}{x}\right)}{\sin\left(\frac{3}{x}\right)}}=\limitX{z}{0}{\textstyle\frac{\sin(2z)}{\sin(3z)}}{z\gt 0}.
      </me>
      Now we apply L<rsq/>Hôpital<rsq/>s Rule and we see that <me>\tlimit{x}{\infty}{\frac{\sin\left(\frac{2}{x}\right)}{\sin\left(\frac{3}{x}\right)}}\lhopeq\limitX{z}{0}{\textstyle\frac{2\cos(2z)}{3\cos(3z)}}{z\gt 0}=\frac23.</me>
    </p>
    <p>
      
      Far more important than the answer in this example is the realization
      that we can use the same trick to extend L<rsq/>Hôpital<rsq/>s Rule to the
      case where <m>x</m> approaches both <m>\infty,</m> and <m>-\infty.</m>
    </p>
    <p>

      To see this in the general situation
      suppose that <m>\limit{x}{\infty}{f(x)}=0</m> and
      <m>\limit{x}{\infty}{g(x)}=0.</m> If we  make the substitution
      <m>z=\frac{1}{x}</m> then as <m>x\rightarrow\infty</m>
      we  have  one-sided limits as <m>z</m> approaches zero from the
      right side. Now we can use L<rsq/>Hôpital<rsq/>s Rule with
      <m>z</m> as the variable:
      <md>
        <mrow>
          \limit{x}{\infty}{\frac{f(x)}{g(x)}} \amp{}=
          \rlimit{z}{0}{\frac{f\left(\frac1z\right)}{g\left(\frac1z\right)}}
          
        </mrow>
        <mrow>
          \amp \lhopeq
          \rlimit{z}{0}
          {\left(\frac{f^\prime\left(\frac1z\right)}{g^\prime(\frac1z)}\cdot\cancelto{1}{\frac{-z^{-2}}{-z^{-2}}}\right)}
        </mrow>
        <mrow>
          \amp =\rlimit{z}{0}{  \frac{f^\prime\left(\frac1z\right)}  {g^\prime\left(\frac1z\right)} }
        </mrow>
        <mrow>
          \amp =\limit{x}{\infty}{\frac{f^\prime(x)}{g^\prime(x)}}.
        </mrow>
      </md>

      A similar development would work for <m>x\rightarrow-\infty.</m>
    </p>
    <p>
      <idx><h>Vocabulary</h><h>Hôpital  Indeterminate</h></idx>
      Although we have not discussed it here,  L<rsq/>Hôpital<rsq/>s
      Rule also
      applies directly to the indeterminate form
      <m>\frac{\approach{\pm\infty}}{\approach{\pm\infty}}</m>, as well
      as 
      <m>\frac{\approach{0}}{\approach{0}}</m>. So we will also
      call these <term>L<rsq/>Hôpital  Indeterminates</term>.
    </p>
    <p>

      Putting this all together gives us the general statement of
      L<rsq/>Hôpital<rsq/>s Rule:
    </p>





    <theorem xml:id="THEOREMLHRuleGen">
      <title>L<rsq/>Hôpital<rsq/>s Rule</title>
      <idx><h>Theorem</h><h>L<rsq/>Hôpital<rsq/>s Rule</h></idx>
      <p>
        Suppose <m>\limit{x}{a}{\frac{f(x)}{g(x)}}</m> is any
        L<rsq/>Hôpital   Indeterminate.  Then

          \limit{x}{a}{\frac{f(x)}{g(x)}}=\limit{x}{a}{\frac{f^\prime(x)}{g^\prime(x)}}.
        </me>
        We allow the possibility that <m>a=\pm\infty</m> which we understand to
        mean that <m>x</m> increases or decreases without bound.

        increase without bound, but which one increases faster?  Take a

      <p>
        As <m>x\rightarrow\infty</m> both graphs are flattening out, but it
        would appear that the natural logarithm function is outgrowing the
        cube root function. Is it?
        
        We can answer this question by looking at the limit,
        <me>\limit{x}{\infty}{\frac{\ln(x)}{\sqrt[3]{x}}}.</me>
        If the limit is <m>\infty</m> then <m>f(x)=\ln(x)</m> is growing faster. If it
        is zero then <m>g(x) = \sqrt[3]{x}</m> is increasing faster than
        <m>f(x)=\ln(x).</m> (Do you see why?)

      Colloquially, the phrase <q>exponential growth</q> just means that
      something is growing very fast, but it has a more precise meaning in mathematics. It means the growth rate
      is described by an exponential function. For example neither
      <m>f(x)=x^2</m> nor <m>f(x)=x^{200}</m> grows exponentially. They are both said to  grow <q>polynomially</q>. But <m>f(x) = e^x</m>,
      <m>f(x)=2^x</m>, and even <m>f(x)=1.0001^x</m> all do grow exponentially  The
      next problem explores how <q>exponential growth</q>  compares
      <q>polynomial growth.</q>

      <p>
        Consider the limit
        <me>
          \limit{x}{\infty}{ \left[ x \tan\left(\frac1x\right)
          \right]}.
        </me>
        If we want to evaluate this limit (we do) we seem to have few
        options. This is not a L<rsq/>Hôpital  Indeterminate, nor is it obvious what
        the limit might be.
        
        Simply letting <m>x\rightarrow\infty</m> we see that <m>x\rightarrow\infty</m>
        and <m>\tan\left(\frac1x\right)\rightarrow0</m> so our limit has the
        Indeterminate form <m>\approach{\infty}\cdot\approach{0}</m>. 
      </p>
      <p>
        There is a
        real temptation to say that this must be zero since anything
        multiplied by zero is zero.  But is it? Remember that the purpose of
        the arrow notation, <m>(\rightarrow0)</m>, is to remind us that the
        expression <m>\tan\left(\frac{1}{x}\right)</m> is never actually equal to
        zero. It merely approaches zero. At the same time <m>x</m> is increasing
        without bound (<m>x\rightarrow\infty</m>) so it seems that the value of the
        limit might depend on the relative speeds with which
        <m>x\rightarrow\infty</m> and
        <m>\tan\left(\frac{1}{x}\right)\rightarrow0</m>.
      </p>

      <p>
        But this reasoning feels very uncertain doesn<rsq/>t it? And, in any case,
        nothing we<rsq/>ve said will help us evaluate the limit.

        We<rsq/>ll have to find a way to re-express this limit as a L<rsq/>Hôpital
        Indeterminate so that L<rsq/>Hôpital<rsq/>s Rule does apply.  In the meantime,
        take your best guess as to the value of this limit and write it down
        for later reference.

        Suppose we rewrite this limit as
        <me>\limit{x}{\infty}{ \left[ x \tan\left(\frac1x\right) \right]} =
        \limit{x}{\infty}{\frac{\tan\left(\frac1x\right)}{\frac1x}}. </me>  This
        is a little scary to look at so we<rsq/>ll make it easier on our eyes with
        the substitution <m>z=\frac1x</m>.  As <m>x\rightarrow\infty</m> we see that
        <m>z\gt0</m> and <m>z\rightarrow0</m>. Since <m>\tan(0)=0</m> our limit is now
        <m>\rlimit{z}{0}{\frac{\tan\left(z\right)}{z}}</m> which is the L<rsq/>Hôpital
        Indeterminate <m>\frac{(\rightarrow0)}{(\rightarrow0)}</m>.

        Thus by <xref ref="THEOREMLHRuleGen">Theorem</xref> we have
        <me>
          \limit{x}{\infty}{x\tan\left(\frac1x\right)}
          =
          \rlimit{z}{0}{\frac{\tan\left(z\right)}{z}}
          \lhopeq\rlimit{z}{0}{\frac{\sec^2\left(z\right)}{1}}= \frac{\sec^2(0)}{1}=1
        </me>
        since <m>\sec(0)=1</m>.

      </p>
    </example>
    <p>
      Did you guess correctly?
    </p>
    <p>
      Notice that the trick we used was a simple substitution much like the
      ones we have used in the past to make things <q>easier on the eyes.</q>
      The difference here is that we<rsq/>re not making anything <q>easier on the
      eyes.</q> If anything we<rsq/>re making things harder to look at since
      re-writing <m>x</m> as <m>\frac{1}{\frac1x}</m> certainly doesn<rsq/>t seem like it<rsq/>s
      going to help much.  Until we try it. Always try your ideas out no
      matter how crazy they seem to be. Only after you try an idea can you
      tell if it will work or not.
    </p>
    <p>

      Recall that in <xref ref="SECTIONexponential">Section</xref> where we defined the
      effective yield of an investment which is compounded continuously. We
      were led to examine the expression <m>\left(1+\frac{1}{m}\right)^m</m> for
      very large values of <m>m</m>.
    </p>

    <p>
      As a result of that investigation we accumulated considerable
      numerical evidence that in one year an investment of <m>1</m> growing at
      a nominal rate of <m>5\%</m>, compounded continuously would grow to
      <m>e^{0.05}\approx 1.0513</m>, but we were unable to do more than
      gather evidence. It was pretty convincing evidence but it was not
      proof since we didn<rsq/>t yet have the mathematical technique necessary to
      evaluate the expression <m>\left(1+\frac{1}{m}\right)^m</m> as
      <m>m\rightarrow\infty</m>.
      Now we do.
    </p>

    <example xml:id="EXAMPLELimComp1">
      <p>
        We need to evaluate the limit:
        <me>
          \limit{m}{\infty}{ \left( 1+\frac{1}{m} \right)^m}.
        </me>
        It is tempting to reason as follows. We see that
        <m>1+\frac{1}{m}\rightarrow1</m> as <m>m\rightarrow\infty</m>. That is, we
        have the indeterminate form <m>\approach{1}^{\approach{\infty}}</m> and
        since one raised to any power is equal to one this limit must equal
        <m>1</m>, right? Surely you know better than to jump to that conclusion by
        now. Not only does all of the evidence of this chapter warn you that
        limits are more subtle than that, but in our investigations in
        <xref ref="SECTIONexponential"></xref> we saw overwhelming evidence that this
        limit is not equal to one.

      </p>
      <p>

        Also, notice that we wrote
        <m>\approach{1}^{\approach{\infty}}</m>, not <m>1^{\approach{\infty}}</m>. Why
        do you think we did that?

      </p>
      <p>

        The source of our difficulty here is that the variable <m>m</m> is in the
        exponent where we can<rsq/>t get at it. We<rsq/>d like to find a way to bring it
        out of the exponent. The natural logarithm seems perfect for this task
        since it has the property that <m>\ln\left(a^b\right)=b\ln(a)</m>.

      </p>
      <p>

        Begin by setting <m>y=\left(1+\frac{1}{m}\right)^m</m>. Then
        <me>
          \ln(y)=
          \ln\left(1+\frac{1}{m}\right)^m =
          m\ln\left(1+\frac{1}{m}\right).
        </me>
        Rather than evaluating <m>\limit{t}{\infty}{y}</m> directly we evaluate the
        limit of the logarithm of <m>y</m>. Thus
        <me>\limit{m}{\infty}{\ln(y)} =
        \limit{m}{\infty}{m\ln\left(1+\frac{1}{m}\right) }.
        </me>
        The limit on the right is an indeterminate form but unfortunately it
        is not a L<rsq/>Hôpital  Indeterminate.  So, as before, we<rsq/>ll have to do some
        algebraic manipulations first.  Set <m>\frac1m=z</m> so that
        <me>
          \limit{t}{\infty}{\ln(y)}
          =\rlimit{z}{0}{\frac{\ln\left(1+z\right)}{z} }
          \lhopeq\rlimit{z}{0}{\frac{\frac{1}{1+z}}{1}}=1.
        </me>
        Since <m>\limit{m}{\infty}{\ln(y)}=1</m> it seems intuitively clear that
        <m>\limit{m}{\infty}{y}=\limit{m}{\infty}{\left(1+\frac1m\right)^m}=e^{1}</m>, doesn<rsq/>t it?

        In fact, it is not true generally that
        <md>
          <mrow>\textcolor{blue}{\tlimit{x}{a}{\textcolor{red}{f(g(x))}}} \text{ is equal to }
          \textcolor{red}{f}\textcolor{blue}{\left(\tlimit{x}{a}{g(x)}\right)}.</mrow>
        </md>
        But it is true for this problem.
        so it is a detail that needn<rsq/>t trouble us for now.

        We will ignore it for now and return to it in <xref

        This is a L<rsq/>Hôpital  Indeterminate so we
        apply L<rsq/>Hôpital<rsq/>s Rule:
        <me>
          \limitX{t}{0}{\ln(y)}{t\gt0} =
          \limitX{t}{0}{\frac{\ln(t)}{t^{-1}}}{t\gt0} \lhopeq
          \limitX{t}{0}{\frac{t^{-1}}{-t^{-2}}}{t\gt0} =
          \limitX{t}{0}{(-t)}{t\gt0} = 0.
        </me>
        Thus
        <me>
          \limitX{t}{0}{t^t}{t\gt0}  = e^0=1.
        </me>
      </p>

    <p>
      We have seen the following indeterminate forms:
      
      <ol cols="2">
        <li>
          <p>
            <m>\approach{\infty}-\approach{\infty}</m>
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <m>\approach{0}\approach{\infty}</m>
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <m>\approach{0}^{\approach{0}}</m>
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <m>\approach{1}^{\approach{\infty}}</m>
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <m>\frac{\approach{0}}{\approach{0}}</m>
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <m>\frac{\approach{\infty}}{\approach{\infty}}</m>.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ol>
    </p>
    <p>
      Of these, only the
      last two are L<rsq/>Hôpital  Indeterminate forms. The others must be evaluated
      by some method other than directly applying L<rsq/>Hôpital<rsq/>s Rule. Often this
      simply means algebraically rearranging them into a L<rsq/>Hôpital
      Indeterminate.
    </p>
    <p>

      The following are not indeterminate forms. Don<rsq/>t try to use
      L<rsq/>Hôpital<rsq/>s Rule on them. (In fact, you can evaluate each of
      these just by knowing the form. Try it.)

      <ol cols="3">
        <li>
          <p>
            <m>\approach{\infty}+\approach{\infty}</m>
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <m>\approach{1}^\approach{0}</m>
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <m>\approach{0}^\approach{\infty}</m>.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ol>
