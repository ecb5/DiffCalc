        In the introduction to <xref ref="CHAPTERwhat-deriv-tells">Chapter</xref> we mentioned
        that the original motivation for the invention of Calculus was
        optimization. But after it was invented scientists and mathematicians
        found that Calculus is useful for solving a wide variety of other
        kinds of problems. In this chapter we will explore how Calculus helps
        us solve various non-optimization problems. As you will see the
        ability  to sketch the graph of a function, even if it is only
        qualitative, is extremely useful.

      <p>

        Suppose we are running an industrial trout fishery. There are a number of
        questions we'd really like to be able to answer at any given time. How
        large is the current stock? Do we have too few? Too many?  Is our
        stock of trout in danger of dying off due to under or over population? How
        frequently can we harvest our stock without endangering it? Even if
        precise numbers aren't possible, it would still be useful to have a
        good, qualitative understanding of the life cycle of our stock of trout
        so we could make reliable estimates.
      </p>

      <p>
        To gain such an understanding we will build a model of our trout
        population as a function of time. As a first approximation assume that
        we have complete control of the lake where we will hold the trout.  We
        can supply all of the food and space that our trout need to continue
        reproducing.
      </p>

      <p>
        Suppose that our lake is stocked with an initial purchase of <m>10</m> tons
        of trout.  Let <m>P(t)</m> represent the amount of fish we have, in tons,
        at time, <m>t</m>, in years, (so <m>P(0)=10</m> tons). We can estimate the rate
        of growth of our population by casting a net into the same point of
        the lake each year and weighing the catch. Comparing the weight of
        the catch from year to year will give  a reasonable estimate of
        the rate at which the trout population grows in one year.
      </p>
      <aside>
        <title>Comment</title>
        <p>
          Of course we'd want
          to always use the same sized net as well.
        </p>
      </aside>


      <p>
        For the sake of specificity, suppose that the population is growing
        continuously at a nominal growth rate of <m>10</m>%.
        Then we have
        <me>
          \dfdx{P}{t}=0.1P
        </me>
        just as we did in <xref ref="SECTIONexponential-growth">Section</xref>.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        So the first model for our trout fishery lake is the following IVP:
        <mdn>
          <mrow  xml:id="EQUATIONFishery1">      \dfdx{P}{t}=.1P,\amp{}\amp{}       P(0)=10.</mrow>
          
        </mdn>
      </p>

      <p>
        This IVP should look familiar. When we were modeling
        the growth of a bacteria colony in <xref ref="EXAMPLEpopulation-growth"></xref>
        we got
        <xref ref="EQUATIONBacteriaIVP">IVP</xref>,
        which is almost the same equation, remember? The only difference
        between them is
        that in <xref ref="EQUATIONFishery1">IVP</xref> the coefficient of <m>P</m> is <m>0.1</m>
        and in <xref ref="EQUATIONBacteriaIVP">IVP</xref> the coefficient of <m>P</m> is
        <m>0.3</m>.
      </p>

      <p>
        Since the solution of <xref
        ref="EQUATIONBacteriaIVP">equation</xref> was
        <m>
          P(t)=10e^{0.3t}</m> it seems reasonable to conclude that the solution of
          <xref ref="EQUATIONFishery1">equation</xref> is:
          <me>
            P(t)=10e^{0.1t}.
          </me>
        </p>

        <problem>
          <statement>
            <p>
              Confirm that <m>P(t)=10e^{0.1t}</m> solves <xref
              ref="EQUATIONFishery1">IVP</xref>.
            </p>
          </statement>
        </problem>

        <p>
          The graph of <m>P(t)</m> is shown below. As you can see our
          trout population is growing exponentially, so
          it appears that we<rsq/>re going to get very rich as soon as we sell of all
          of those fish.
        </p>
         <image source="DC/Fishery1.png" width="50%"/>

         <p>
           Of course, in practice this is not what happens. We made several
           simplifying assumptions when we began.  We assumed that (1) we
           could supply all of the food our growing population needs, and (2)
           our trout would have all of the room they needed.
         </p>

         <p>
           These assumptions are unrealistic in the long run.  But in the
           short run they are not completely crazy.
         </p>

         <p>
           Recall that in <xref ref="CHAPTERlast-elem-funct"></xref>
           we described a situation in Lake Erie near Toledo, Ohio
           when, for a few days, the algae population grew
           exponentially in much the same manner as that suggested by
           our trout model.  Naturally such growth cannot be
           sustained. Eventually the algae will consume all of the
           available nutrients, or will simply run out of space. They
           will then begin to die off. But our model, simple as it is,
           gives pretty accurate predictions of the population for
           small values of <m>t</m>, be they a population of bacteria,
           algae, trout, or even humans.
         </p>

         <p>
           In building a mathematical model of any physical phenomenon we start
           with the simplest model we can, find out where it goes bad, and then
           <q>tweak</q> it so that we:
           
           <ol>
             <li>
               <p>
                 keep those properties of the model that make realistic
                 predictions, and
               </p>
             </li>
             <li>
               <p>
                 eliminate those properties of the model that make unrealistic    predictions.
               </p>
             </li>
           </ol>

           Thus we need to tweak <xref
           ref="EQUATIONFishery1">IVP</xref> in such a way that
           <m>\dfdx{P}{t}=0.1P</m> when <m>P</m> is near zero (or, at
           least, <m>\dfdx{P}{t}\approx0.1P</m>), but which also
           recognizes that exponential growth is unsustainable.
         </p>

         <p>
           Since exponential growth can't be maintained indefinitely
           the population must eventually stop growing and drop to a
           lower level <mdash/> or collapse entirely. Thus there must
           be a maximum population level, <m>P(t)</m>, where
           <m>\dfdx{P}{t}=0</m>. Whatever that level is, we'll call it
           <m>C</m>.
         </p>

         <p>
           One way to tweak <xref ref="EQUATIONFishery1">IVP</xref> to
           reflect this fact is to insert the factor <m>(C-P)</m> as
           follows
           <men xml:id="EQUATIONFirstTweak">
             \dfdx{P}{t}=0.1P(C-P).
           </men>
           We see that if the trout population ever reaches <m>C</m> it must level off
           since in that case <m>\dfdx{P}{t}=0</m>. Therefore this model avoids
           predicting that the trout population will grow exponentially.
         </p>

         <p>
           However, notice that for values of <m>P</m> near zero, <m>C-P\approx
           C</m>. Thus <xref ref="EQUATIONFirstTweak">equation</xref>
           says that when <m>P</m> is near zero
           <me>
             \dfdx{P}{t}\approx\left(0.1C\right)P
           </me>
           but we needed <m> \dfdx{P}{t}\approx0.1P</m> so this
           particular tweak won't quite work because the difference between
           <m>\dfdx{P}{t}\approx0.01P</m> and <m>\dfdx{P}{t}\approx\left(0.01C\right)P</m>
           could be substantial,  depending on the value of
           <m>C</m> (which we don't know).
         </p>

         <p>
           So we will try a slightly different tweak. Instead of <m>(C-P)</m> we will
           insert the factor <m>\left(1-\frac{P}{C}\right)</m> as in
           <xref ref="EQUATIONFishery2">IVP</xref> below.
           <men xml:id="EQUATIONFishery2">
             
             \dfdx{P}{t}=0.1P\left(1-\frac{P}{C}\right), \ P(0)=10.
           </men>
           Notice that we still have <m>\dfdx{P}{t}=0</m> when <m>P=C</m>. But now we also have
           <m>\dfdx{P}{t}\approx0.1P</m> when <m>P</m> is close to zero, so this change
           seems to meet the goal of our tweak.
           This type of <xref ref="EQUATIONFishery2">IVP</xref> is called the Logistic Equation
           (or the Logistic Model) and its solution is a better long-term
           predictor of population growth than is the solution of
           <xref ref="EQUATIONFishery1">equation</xref> as we will see.
         </p>

         <p>
           The parameter <m>C</m> would normally be determined experimentally
           (measured), but for purposes of this discussion we will arbitrarily
           assign it the value <m>C=100</m> just to keep the numbers easy to deal
           with. So, our IVP will be
           <mdn>
             <mrow xml:id="EQUATIONLogEq">\dfdx{P}{t}=0.1P\left(1-\frac{P}{100}\right),\amp{}\amp{} P(0)=10.</mrow>

         </problem>

         <p>
           It would be nice if we could find a formula for <m>P(t)</m> in terms of
           <m>t</m> but this will have to wait for a course in Integral Calculus.
           Still we would like to provide a reasonable sketch of the graph of
           <m>P = P(t)</m>.  Aside from the initial condition, <m>P(0) = 10</m>, we don't
           know any specific values of <m>P(t)</m> but we can at least capture the
           qualitative behavior of the population.
         </p>

         <p>
           We will obtain a sketch of the graph of <m>P(t)</m> in the same systematic
           way as before.  We  can use the first derivative test to determine
           when the trout population is increasing or decreasing. But keep in mind
           that we have <m>\dfdx{P}{t}</m> in terms of <m>P</m> <mdash/> not <m>t</m> <mdash/> so we won't
           be able to say that the population is increasing or decreasing at a
           particular time. This will change how we interpret the results. For
           example we can say that when we have <m>25</m> tons of trout the population
           is increasing even though we do not know <em>when</em> this happens.
         </p>

         <p>
           It should be straightforward to see that the POTPs are <m>P = 0,
           100</m>. Since the context of our problem prohibits <m>P \lt  0</m> (why?),
           we will look at intervals <m>[0,100)</m> and <m>(100, \infty)</m> to determine
           for which values of <m>P</m> the population is increasing or
           decreasing. We summarize this analysis in the following  table:

           We now have enough data on to plot a reasonable sketch of the graph
           of <m>P=P(t)</m> but because all of our formulas are in terms of the
           dependent variable <m>P</m>, our transition points and intervals are will
           all be
           shown on the vertical axis, not the horizontal as seen below.
         </p>

         <image source="DC/IncDecChart2.png" width="100%" />

         <p>
           Notice that we drew solid horizontal lines at <m>P=0</m>
           and <m>P= 100</m>. At these population levels
           <m>\dfdx{P}{t}=0</m> so, theoretically at least, once the
           population has achieved either of these levels it will
           never change again. This is correct when
           <m>P(0)=0</m>. Once all of our fish have died the only way
           we can get more is to buy them and start again. But for
           other values of <m>P</m> it is still not entirely clear
           what<rsq/>s happening to our fish population.
         </p>

         <p>
           It is not possible to maintain a population of trout at a
           constant value of <m>100</m> tons. There will always be a little
           fluctuation above and below. All models are inaccurate in some
           way. This is one way in which this model is inaccurate.
         </p>

         <p>
           The dashed line represents the population level where the graph of the
           population transitions from concave up to concave down. Physically
           this means that the rate of growth transitions from accelerating to
           decelerating.  We can visualize this (below) using slope field
           technique we saw in <xref ref="SECTIONGraphingWithDeriv"></xref>.
         </p>

         <image source="DC/SlopeField1.png" width="100%"/>

         <p>
           Starting with an initial value
           of <m>P(0)=10</m>, we can plot the graph of the  population and make a
           prediction of what will happened to the population in the long
           term. We just can<rsq/>t tell what <q>long term</q> means.  That would have to
           be determined
           experimentally.
         </p>

         <p>
           Notice that on the vertical interval <m>(0,50)</m> the population is
           accelerating until it reaches <m>P=50</m> tons. After that, it still grows,
           but is starting to decelerate. Over the long run it will approach (but
           never quite reach) a level of <m>P=100</m> tons.

         <title>The Competing Species Model</title>

         <p>
           When we modeled the populations of trout and bass in an industrial
           farm we did not have to account for competition between species
           because we assumed that the two species of fish were kept in separate
           lakes. For fish living in the wild we cannot make that assumption, but
           we can tweak our original model to account for competition between
           species in a natural setting. To do this we<rsq/>ll have to use two
           equations, one for each species.
         </p>

         <p>
           So let<rsq/>s introduce a competing species of fish into the same lake.
           Bass and walleye compete in the wild for the same food source, so each
           one’s presence affects the other’s growth rate. To model the walleye
           population take <m>C=400</m> for the carrying capacity,  <m>r=0.2</m> as the
           intrinsic growth rate of the walleye, and let <m>W=W(t)</m> denote the
           amount of walleye (in tons) at time <m>t</m>. Combining this with our model
           for the bass population from <xref ref="PROBLEMBassModel"></xref> we have
           the following equations for each species separately:

           <mdn>
             <mrow  xml:id="EQUATIONCompSpec1">
               % \label{eq:CompSpec1}
               \text{Bass:  }    \dfdx{B}{t}\amp=.25B\left(1-\frac{B}{500}\right)
             </mrow>
             <mrow xml:id="EQUATIONCompSpec2">

               \text{Walleye: } \dfdx{W}{t}\amp= .2W\left(1-\frac{W}{400}\right)
             </mrow>
           </mdn>

           These equations have no terms that model cross-species
           competition. That is, the value of <m>B(t)</m> does not affect the
           value of <m>W(t)</m> and <foreign>vice versa</foreign>, so we<rsq/>ll
           have to insert terms which do that.
         </p>

         <p>
           Since they compete for food each species affects the others growth
           rate detrimentally. So we will model this interaction as
           follows
           <md>
             <mrow>
               \dfdx{B}{t}\amp=.25B\left(1-\frac{B}{500}\right)-0.0001BW
             </mrow>
             <mrow>
               \dfdx{W}{t}\amp= .2W\left(1-\frac{W}{400}\right)-0.0001BW.
             </mrow>
           </md>
         </p>
         <aside>
           <title>Comment</title>
           <p>
             Just like the growth rates and carrying capacities we
             used earlier, these numbers are fabricated. We made them up. We (the
             authors) have inserted values for these parameters that we believe
             are reasonable but we do not pretend to know what might be
             realistic. If we were modeling a real population we would determine
             all of these parameters experimentally.
           </p>
         </aside>

         <p>
           Notice that we took the growth rates from before and subtracted an
           identical term <m>0.0001BW</m>.  This represents the detrimental effect of
           each species on the other<rsq/>s growth rate.  For simplicity, we assumed
           that the effect of each on the other is the same.  The fact that the
           new term, <m>-0.0001BW</m>, has the product <m>BW</m> in it reflects the idea
           that to have an appreciable effect on each other, both species must
           have a sufficient number to produce the required interactions.  Again,
           this model is overly simplified, but let’s see what long term effect
           this tweak has on both species.
         </p>

         <p>
           To see that this is truly just a tweak of our previous model notice
           that if <m>W=0</m>, then we would recover the previous model and over time
           <m>B</m> would approach its carrying capacity of <m>500</m> tons.  Likewise, if
           <m>B=0</m>, then, again we recover the previous model and over time <m>W</m>
           would approach its carrying capacity of <m>400</m> tons.
         </p>

         <p>
           Given that <m>B,W\ge0</m>, we want to determine what  this model will
           predict happens to both species in the long term.  Could they coexist
           or would one species drive the other to extinction? Take your best
           guess.
         </p>

         <p>
           We<rsq/>ll start with <m>B</m>. We want to find all of the
           points where <m>\dfdx{B}{t}\gt0</m> (<m>B</m> is growing)
           and where <m>\dfdx{B}{t}\lt0</m> (<m>B</m> is
           shrinking). We will start by determining where
           <m>\dfdx{B}{t}=0</m>.

           <md>
             <mrow>
               0=\dfdx{B}{t}\amp{}=.25B\left(1-\frac{B}{500}\right)-.0001BW

             <mrow>
               \amp{}=B\left[.25\left(1-\frac{B}{500}\right)-.0001W\right].

           </md>
         </p>

         <p>
           Thus we see that <m>\dfdx{B}{t}=0</m> when
           
           <men xml:id="EQUATIONCompete1">
             B=0

           or when

         </p>

         <p>
           Next we form the (<m>B</m>)ass<mdash/>(<m>W</m>)alleye
           plane, where each point <m>(B,W)</m> identifies a
           particular pair of possible populations.  For example the
           point <m>(200, 500)</m> represents the situation when there
           are <m>200</m> tons of bass and <m>500</m> tons of walleye
           in the lake.
         </p>

         <p>
           In the sketch below  we see from
           <xref ref="EQUATIONCompete1">equation</xref> and
           <xref ref="EQUATIONCompete2">equation</xref> that on each of the red lines we
           have <m>\dfdx{B}{t}=0</m>.
         </p>

         <image source="DC/CompetingSpeciesModel1.png" width="40%"/>


         <p>
           Since the two red lines are the only locations where
           <m>\dfdx{B}{t}=0</m>, it must be that <m>\dfdx{B}{t}</m> is
           either greater than zero or less that zero in any region
           bounded by them. Choosing the point <m>(1,1)</m> in the
           shaded region we see that

           <me>\eval{\dfdx{B}{t}} {(B,W)}{(1,1)}\gt0.</me>

           Choosing the point <m>(2000,2000)</m> outside the blue
           region we see that

           <me>\eval{\dfdx{B}{t}}{(B,W)}{(2000,2000)}\lt0.</me>

           So for any bass/walleye pair, <m>(B,W)</m>, the bass
           population is increasing when <m>(B,W)</m> lies below the
           diagonal line (in the blue region), and for any
           bass/walleye pair, <m>(B,W)</m>, above the diagonal line,
           the amount of bass is decreasing.
         </p>

         <p>
           Finally, notice that when <m>W=0</m> the bass population
           will increase until it reaches the carrying capacity of the
           lake for bass alone (<m>500</m>), after which it will start
           to decrease. But if there are walleye in the lake the bass
           population will not reach the carrying capacity before it
           begins to decrease. This is consistent with the notion that
           the number of walleye adversely affect the growth rate of
           the bass.
         </p>

         <p>
           Next we need to perform a similar analysis for the walleye
           population.

         <p>
           But what happens if we don’t start at an equilibrium point?  Would the
           levels tend toward an equilibrium over time  as the name suggests?
           Take your best guess.
         </p>

         <p>
           We can figure this out by looking at the growth rates in
           each region.  For example, suppose the initial populations
           of bass and walleye, <m>(B,W)</m> is in the blue region in
           <xref ref="FIGURECompetingSpeciesModel10"></xref>. The bass
           population is increasing. Think of this as an arrow
           pointing to the right. In the same region the walleye
           population is decreasing which we can think of as an arrow
           pointing downward. Combining these arrows gives us an arrow
           pointing down and to the right.
         </p>

         <p>
           Similarly, in the purple area the trajectory of the
           populations will be up and to the right since both
           populations are increasing. In the red area it will be up
           and to the left, while in the white area it will be down
           and to the left.
         </p>

         <p>
           <xref ref="FIGURECompetingSpeciesModel10"></xref> gives us
           an rough, qualitative idea of the population trajectories
           that this model predicts for the bass and walleye
           populations starting from various initial values.

           these initial levels of bass and walleye, the levels will
           approach <m>E_B</m> tons of bass and <m>E_w</m> tons of

           The SIR Model is a fairly simple model that is frequently used to

           get the disease twice) and the rate of decrease is
           proportional to the number of susceptible and the number of

           Since the only way to become immune is to recover from the
           disease, we also assume that the rate of change of <m>R</m>
           is proportional to the number of infected individuals
           present.  This means that <me>\dfdx{R}{t}=bI</me> for some
           positive constant <m>b</m>. The constant <m>b</m> is called
           the <term>recovery rate</term>. (Why?)

           Putting this together we see that the number of infected is
           increasing and accelerating when

             \frac{b}{a}+\left(\frac{I}{2}+\sqrt{\left( \frac{I}{2}\right)^2+\frac{bI}{a}}\right)\lt S\lt 1
           </me>
           and increasing, but slowing down, when
           <me>
             \frac{b}{a}\lt S\lt \frac{b}{a}+\left(\frac{I}{2}+\sqrt{\left(\frac{I}{2}\right)^2+\frac{bI}{a}}\right).
           </me>
           When <m>S\lt \frac{b}{a}</m> it is decreasing.

           We first looked at the curve called the tractrix <xref ref="PROBLEMTractrix">
           </xref> of <xref ref="SECTIONEulersMethod"></xref>.
           Consider reviewing that problem  before you proceed.
         </p>

         <p>
           Recall that initially the center of the rear axle of the tractor is at
           the origin and the center of the rear axle of the trailer is at the
           point <m>(1,0)</m> Also we assumed that the tractor pulls the front wheels
           vertically up the <m>y</m>-axis and that the rear wheels don’t slip.
         </p>

         <p>
           <xref ref="PROBLEMTractrix"></xref> we showed that the path followed by
           the center of the rear axle of the trailer follows, <m>y=y(t)</m>, must
           satisfy the IVP:
