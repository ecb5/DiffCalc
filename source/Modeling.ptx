    In the introduction to <xref ref="CHAwhat-deriv-tells">Chapter</xref> we mentioned
    that the original motivation for the invention of Calculus was
    optimization. But after it was invented scientists and mathematicians
    found that Calculus is useful for solving a wide variety of other
    kinds of problems. In this chapter we will explore how Calculus helps
    us solve various non-optimization problems. As you will see the
    ability  to sketch the graph of a function, even if it is only
    qualitative, is extremely useful.

<p>

    Suppose we are running an industrial trout fishery. There are a number of
    questions we'd really like to be able to answer at any given time. How
    large is the current stock? Do we have too few? Too many?  Is our
    stock of trout in danger of dying off due to under or over population? How
    frequently can we harvest our stock without endangering it? Even if
    precise numbers aren't possible, it would still be useful to have a
    good, qualitative understanding of the life cycle of our stock of trout
    so we could make reliable estimates.
</p>
<p>

    To gain such an understanding we will build a model of our trout
    population as a function of time. As a first approximation assume that
    we have complete control of the lake where we will hold the trout.  We
    can supply all of the food and space that our trout need to continue
    reproducing.
</p>
<p>

    Suppose that our lake is stocked with an initial purchase of <m>10</m> tons
    of trout.  Let <m>P(t)</m> represent the amount of fish we have, in tons,
    at time, <m>t</m>, in years, (so <m>P(0)=10</m> tons). We can estimate the rate
    of growth of our population by casting a net into the same point of
    the lake each year and weighing the catch\aside{Of course we'd want
    to always use the same sized net as well.}. Comparing the weight of
    the catch from year to year will give  a reasonable estimate of
    the rate at which the trout population grows in one year.
</p>
<p>

    For the sake of specificity, suppose that the population is growing
    continuously at a nominal growth rate of <m>10\%</m>. %  This
    Then we have
    <me>
      \dfdx{P}{t}=0.1P
    </me>
    just as we did in <xref ref="SECexponential-growth">Section</xref>.
</p>
<p>
    
    So the first model for our trout fishery lake is the following IVP:
    <me>
      \dfdx{P}{t}=.1P,\ \       P(0)=10.
      \label{eq:Fishery1}
    </me>
</p>
<p>



    This IVP should look familiar. When we were modeling
    the growth of a bacteria colony in <xref ref="EXAMPLEpopulation-growth">Example~\</xref>
    <xref ref="SECexponential-growth">Section</xref> we got
    <xref ref="EQBacteriaIVP">IVP~</xref>),
    which is almost the same equation, remember? The only difference
    between them is
    that in <xref ref="EQFishery1">IVP~</xref>) the coefficient of <m>P</m> is <m>0.1</m>
    and in <xref ref="EQBacteriaIVP">IVP~</xref>) the coefficient of <m>y</m> is
    <m>0.3</m>.
</p>
<p>

    Since the solution of <xref ref="EQBacteriaIVP">Equation~</xref>) was
    <m>
      y(t)=10e^{0.3t}</m> it seems reasonable to conclude that the solution of
      <xref ref="EQFishery1">Equation~(</xref>}) is:
      <me>
        P(t)=10e^{0.1t}.
    </me>
</p>

    <exercise>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Confirm that <m>P(t)=10e^{0.1t}</m> solves <xref ref="EQFishery1">IVP~</xref>).

<p>

    The graph of <m>P(t)</m> is shown at the right. As you can see our
    trout population is growing exponentially, so
    it appears that we're going to get very rich as soon as we sell of all
    of those fish.
</p>
<p>

    Of course, in practice this is not what happens. We made several
    simplifying assumptions when we began.  We assumed that (1) we could
    supply all of the food our growing population needs, and (2) our trout
    would have all of the room they needed.
</p>
<p>

    These assumptions are unrealistic in the long run.  But in the short
    run they are not completely crazy.
</p>
<p>

    Recall that in <xref ref="CHAlast-elem-funct">Chapter</xref> we described a
    situation in Lake Erie near Toledo, Ohio when, for a few days, the
    algae population grew exponentially in much the same manner as
    that suggested by our trout model.  Naturally such growth cannot be
    sustained. Eventually the algae will consume all of the available
    nutrients, or will simply run out of space. They will then begin to
    die off. But our model, simple as it is, gives pretty accurate
    predictions of the population for small values of <m>t</m>, be they a
    population of bacteria, algae, trout, or even humans.
</p>
<p>

    In building a mathematical model of any physical phenomenon we start
    with the simplest model we can, find out where it goes bad, and then
    <q>tweak</q> it so that we:
    \begin{enumerate}
    \item keep those properties of the model that make realistic
    predictions, and
    \item eliminate those properties of the model that make unrealistic
    predictions.
    \end{enumerate}
    Thus we need to tweak <xref ref="EQFishery1">IVP~</xref>) in such a way that
    <m>\dfdx{P}{t}=0.1P</m> when <m>P</m> is near zero (or, at least,
    <m>\dfdx{P}{t}\approx0.1P</m>), but which also recognizes
    that exponential growth is unsustainable.
</p>
<p>


    Since exponential growth can't be maintained indefinitely the
    population must eventually stop growing and drop to a lower level --
    or collapse entirely. Thus there must be a maximum population level,
    <m>P(t)</m>, where <m>\dfdx{P}{t}=0</m>. Whatever that level is, we'll call it
    <m>C</m>.
</p>
<p>

    One way to tweak <xref ref="EQFishery1">IVP~</xref>) to reflect this fact is to
    insert the factor <m>(C-P)</m> as follows
    <me>
      \dfdx{P}{t}=0.1P(C-P).
</me>
We see that if the trout population ever reaches <m>C</m> it must level off
since in that case <m>\dfdx{P}{t}=0</m>. Therefore this model avoids
predicting that the trout population will grow exponentially.
</p>
<p>

However, notice that for values of <m>P</m> near zero, <m>C-P\approx C</m>. Thus
this differential equation says that when <m>P</m> is near zero
<me>
  \dfdx{P}{t}\approx\left(0.1C\right)P
</me>
but we needed <m> \dfdx{P}{t}\approx0.1P</m> so this
particular tweak won't quite work because the difference between
<m>\dfdx{P}{t}\approx0.01P</m> and <m>\dfdx{P}{t}\approx\left(0.01C\right)P</m>
could be substantial,  depending on the value of
<m>C</m> (which we don't know).
</p>
<p>




So we will try a slightly different tweak. Instead of <m>(C-P)</m> we will
insert the factor <m>\left(1-\frac{P}{C}\right)</m> as in
<xref ref="EQFishery2">IVP~</xref>) below.
<me>
  \label{eq:Fishery2}
  \dfdx{P}{t}=0.1P\left(1-\frac{P}{C}\right), \ P(0)=10.
</me>
Notice that we still have <m>\dfdx{P}{t}=0</m> when <m>P=C</m>. But now we also have
<m>\dfdx{P}{t}\approx0.1P</m> when <m>P</m> is close to zero, so this change
seems to meet the goal of our tweak.
This type of <xref ref="EQFishery2">IVP~</xref>) is called the Logistic Equation
(or the Logistic Model) and its solution is a better long-term
predictor of population growth than is the solution of
<xref ref="EQFishery1">Equation~</xref>) as we will see.
</p>
<p>

The parameter <m>C</m> would normally be determined experimentally
(measured), but for purposes of this discussion we will arbitrarily
assign it the value <m>C=100</m> just to keep the numbers easy to deal
with. So, our IVP will be
<me>
  \label{eq:LogEq}
  \dfdx{P}{t}=0.1P\left(1-\frac{P}{100}\right),\ \ P(0)=10.
</me>
</p>

<p>

It would be nice if we could find a formula for <m>P(t)</m> in terms of
<m>t</m> but this will have to wait for a course in Integral Calculus.
Still we would like to provide a reasonable sketch of the graph of
<m>P = P(t)</m>.  Aside from the initial condition, <m>P(0) = 10</m>, we don't
know any specific values of <m>P(t)</m> but we can at least capture the
qualitative behavior of the population.
</p>
<p>

We will obtain a sketch of the graph of <m>P(t)</m> in the same systematic
way as before.  We  can use the first derivative test to determine
when the trout population is increasing or decreasing. But keep in mind
that we have <m>\dfdx{P}{t}</m> in terms of <m>P</m> --- not <m>t</m> --- so we won't
be able to say that the population is increasing or decreasing at a
particular time. This will change how we interpret the results. For
example we can say that when we have <m>25</m> tons of trout the population
is increasing even though we do not know <em>when</em> this happens.
</p>
<p>


It should be straightforward to see that the POTPs are <m>P = 0,
100</m>. Since the context of our problem prohibits <m>P \lt  0</m> (why?),
we will look at intervals <m>[0,100)</m> and <m>(100, \infty)</m> to determine
for which values of <m>P</m> the population is increasing or
decreasing. We summarize this analysis in the following  table:
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}[h]{|c|c|c|}
\hline
Interval \amp  <m>(0,100)</m> \amp  <m>(100,\infty)</m>\bigstrut \hline
<m>\dfdx{P}{t}</m>\amp <m>\gt 0</m>\amp <m>\lt 0</m>\bigstrut

<p>
We now have enough data on to plot a reasonable sketch of the graph
of <m>P=P(t)</m> but because all of our formulas are in terms of the
dependent variable <m>P</m>, our transition points and intervals are will
all be
shown on the vertical axis, not the horizontal as seen below.
</p>

<image source="images/IncDecChart2.png" width="60%" />
<!-- \centerline{\includegraphics*[height=2.7in,width=4in]{../Figures/IncDecChart2}} -->
<p>

Notice that we drew solid horizontal lines at <m>P=0</m> and <m>P= 100</m>. At these
population levels <m>\dfdx{P}{t}=0</m> so, theoretically at least, once
the population has achieved either of these levels it will never
change again. This is correct when <m>P(0)=0</m>. Once all of our fish
have died the only way we can get more is to buy them and start
again. But for other values of <m>P</m> it is still not entirely clear
what's happening  to our fish population.
</p>
<p>

It is not possible to maintain a population of trout at a
constant value of <m>100</m> tons. There will always be a little
fluctuation above and below. All models are inaccurate in some
way. This is one way in which this model is inaccurate.
</p>
<p>


The dashed line represents the population level where the graph of
the population transitions from concave up to concave
down. Physically this means that the rate of growth transitions from
accelerating to decelerating.

We can visualize this (at the left) using
slope field technique we saw in
<xref ref="SECgraph-with-form-1">Section</xref>.  Starting with an initial value
of <m>P(0)=10</m>, we can plot the graph of the  population and make a
prediction of what will happened to the population in the long
term. We just can't tell what <q>long term</q> means.  That would have to
be determined
experimentally.
</p>
<p>

Notice that on the vertical interval <m>(0,50)</m> the population is
accelerating until it reaches <m>P=50</m> tons. After that, it still grows,
but is starting to decelerate. Over the long run it will approach (but
never quite reach) a level of <m>P=100</m> tons.

<title>The Competing Species Model</title>

<!-- <!-\- \label{sec:little-healthy-comp} -\-> -->
<p>

When we modeled the populations of trout and bass in an industrial
farm we did not have to account for competition between species
because we assumed that the two species of fish were kept in separate
lakes. For fish living in the wild we cannot make that assumption, but
we can tweak our original model to account for competition between
species in a natural setting. To do this we'll have to use two
equations, one for each species.
</p>
<p>

So let's introduce a competing species of fish into the same lake.
Bass and walleye compete in the wild for the same food source, so each
one’s presence affects the other’s growth rate. To model the walleye
population take <m>C=400</m> for the carrying capacity,  <m>r=0.2</m> as the
intrinsic growth rate of the walleye, and let <m>W=W(t)</m> denote the
amount of walleye (in tons) at time <m>t</m>. Combining this with our model
for the bass population from <xref ref="PROBLEMBassModel">Problem~\</xref> we have
the following equations for each species separately:
\begin{align}
\label{eq:CompSpec1}\text{  Bass: }    \dfdx{B}{t}\amp=.25B\left(1-\frac{B}{500}\right)
\label{eq:CompSpec2}\text{  Walleye: } \dfdx{W}{t}\amp= .2W\left(1-\frac{W}{400}\right)
\end{align}
These equations have no terms modeling cross-species
competition. That is, the value of <m>B(t)</m> does not affect the value of <m>W(t)</m>
and <foreign>vice versa</foreign>, so we'll have to insert terms which do that.
</p>
<p>

Since they compete for food each species affects the others growth
rate detrimentally. So we will model this interaction as
follows\aside{Just like the growth rates and carrying capacities we
used earlier, these numbers are fabricated. We made them up. We (the
authors) have inserted values for these parameters that we believe
are reasonable but we do not pretend to know what might be
realistic. If we were modeling a real population we would determine
all of these parameters experimentally.}
\begin{align*}
\dfdx{B}{t}\amp=.25B\left(1-\frac{B}{500}\right)-0.0001BW
\dfdx{W}{t}\amp= .2W\left(1-\frac{W}{400}\right)-0.0001BW.
\end{align*}
</p>
<p>

Notice that we took the growth rates from before and subtracted an
identical term <m>0.0001BW</m>.  This represents the detrimental effect of
each species on the other's growth rate.  For simplicity, we assumed
that the effect of each on the other is the same.  The fact that the
new term, <m>-0.0001BW</m>, has the product <m>BW</m> in it reflects the idea
that to have an appreciable effect on each other, both species must
have a sufficient number to produce the required interactions.  Again,
this model is overly simplified, but let’s see what long term effect
this tweak has on both species.
</p>
<p>

To see that this is truly just a tweak of our previous model notice
that if <m>W=0</m>, then we would recover the previous model and over time
<m>B</m> would approach its carrying capacity of <m>500</m> tons.  Likewise, if
<m>B=0</m>, then, again we recover the previous model and over time <m>W</m>
would approach its carrying capacity of <m>400</m> tons.
</p>
<p>

Given that <m>B,W\ge0</m>, we want to determine what  this model will
predict happens to both species in the long term.  Could they coexist
or would one species drive the other to extinction? Take your best
guess.
</p>
<p>

We'll start with <m>B</m>. We want to find all of the points  where <m>\dfdx{B}{t}\gt0</m> (<m>B</m> is
growing) and where <m>\dfdx{B}{t}\lt0</m> (<m>B</m> is shrinking). We
will start by determining   where <m>\dfdx{B}{t}=0</m>.
<me>
  0=\dfdx{B}{t}=.25B\left(1-\frac{B}{500}\right)-.0001BW=B\left[.25\left(1-\frac{B}{500}\right)-.0001W\right].
</me>
</p>
<p>

Thus we see that <m>\dfdx{B}{t}=0</m> when
\begin{align}
B\amp=0 \label{equation:Compete1}
\intertext{ or when }
\nonumber  .25\left(1-\frac{B}{500}\right)-.0001W\amp=0
\nonumber  2500\left(1-\frac{B}{500}\right)-W\amp=0
\nonumber  2500-5B-W\amp=0
5B+W\amp=2500. \label{equation:Compete2}
\end{align}
</p>
<p>

Next we form the (<m>B</m>)ass-(<m>W</m>)alleye plane, where each point <m>(B,W)</m>
identifies a particular pair of possible populations.  For example the
point <m>(200, 500)</m> represents the situation when there are <m>200</m> tons
of bass and <m>500</m> tons of walleye in the lake.
</p>

<!-- \end{wrapfigure} -->
<p>

In the sketch at the right we see from
<xref ref="EQUATIONCompete1">Equation~</xref>) and
<xref ref="EQUATIONCompete2">Equation~</xref>) that on each of the red lines we
have <m>\dfdx{B}{t}=0</m>.
</p>
<p>

Since the two red lines are the only locations where <m>\dfdx{B}{t}=0</m>,
it must be that <m>\dfdx{B}{t}</m> is either greater than zero or less that
zero in any region bounded by them. Choosing the point <m>(1,1)</m> in the
shaded region we see that
<m>\eval{\dfdx{B}{t}}{(B,W)}{(1,1)}\gt0</m>. Choosing the point
<m>(2000,2000)</m> outside the blue region we see that
<m>\eval{\dfdx{B}{t}}{(B,W)}{(2000,2000)}\lt0</m>.
So for any bass/walleye pair, <m>(B,W)</m>, the bass population is
increasing when <m>(B,W)</m> lies below the diagonal line (in the blue
region), and for any
bass/walleye pair, <m>(B,W)</m>, above the diagonal line, the amount of
bass is decreasing.
</p>
<p>

Finally, notice that when  <m>W =0</m> the bass population will  increase
until it reaches the carrying capacity of the lake for bass
alone (<m>500</m>), after which it will start to decrease. But if there are
walleye in the lake the bass population will not reach the carrying
capacity before it begins to decrease. This is consistent with the
notion that the number of walleye adversely affect the growth rate of
the bass.
</p>
<p>

Next we need to perform a similar analysis for the walleye population.
</p>

<problem xml:id="problem:WalleyeAnalysis">
  <statement>
    <p>
      <!-- \label{problem:WalleyeAnalysis} -->

decreasing. Plot these regions in the first quadrant of the <m>B</m>-<m>W</m>

<p>
The points where the green and red lines intersect are called
equilibrium points. Theoretically, if the two population levels are at
an equilibrium point then neither population will ever change
again because the growth rates are both zero.

<p>

But what happens if we don’t start at an equilibrium point?  Would the
levels tend toward an equilibrium over time  as the name suggests?
Take your best guess.
</p>
<p>

We can figure this out by looking at the growth rates in each region.
For example, suppose the initial populations of bass and walleye,
<m>(B,W)</m> is in the blue region at the left. The bass population is
increasing. Think of this as an arrow pointing  to the right. In the
same region  the walleye  population is decreasing which we can think
of as an arrow pointing downward. Combining these arrows gives us an
arrow pointing down and to the right.
</p>
<p>

Similarly, in the purple area the trajectory of the populations will
be up and to the right since both populations are increasing. In the
red area it will be up and to the left, while in the white area it
will be down and to the left. All of this is displayed in the sketch
at the left.
</p>
<p>

As rough as this qualitative drawing is, it gives us an idea of the
population trajectories that the model predicts for the population
levels of bass and walleye from various starting points.
</p>
<p>


Notice that these trajectories tend toward the equilibrium point,
<m>E=\left(437.5, 312.5\right)</m>.
This says that given these initial levels of bass and walleye, the
levels will approach <m>E_B</m> tons of bass and <m>E_w</m> tons of walleye.
This kind of problem is called a <term>dynamical system</term> and the path
that the point <m>(B,W)</m> follows for any given set of initial conditions
is called its <term>trajectory</term>.
</p>


<problem>
  <statement>
    <p>
      Are there any initial conditions where the trajectory approaches the

    <title>Epidemics, The SIR Model</title>

    <!-- \label{sec:epidemic-blues:-sir} -->
<p>
The SIR Model is a fairly simple model that is frequently used to
understand the spread of an infectious disease through a population.
As with any mathematical model, it is over-simplified but, just like
<xref ref="EQFishery1">IVP~</xref>, it provides a foundation which can be tweaked
as needed for better predictions.
</p>
<p>
We will assume that every member the population falls into one of
three categories: (S)usceptible, (I)nfected, or (R)ecovered.  We
assume that any population member who has recovered from the disease
is immune to it, and those that have not are susceptible to infection.
</p>
<p>

We let
\begin{align*}
  S\amp =S(t)=\text{ The fraction of the population
  susceptible to infection.}
  I\amp =I(t)=\text{ The fraction of the population
  currently infected.}
  R\amp =R(t)=\text{ The fraction of the population no longer
  susceptible to infection. }
\end{align*}
Note that <m>R(t)</m>
  includes those victims who have died\aside{They have <q>recovered</q> in
    the sense that they can no longer be infected.}
</p>
  

<exercise>
<statement>
<p>
  Assuming that no members are entering or leaving the population (by
  births, deaths from other diseases, or migration), explain why
  <m>S+I+R=1.</m>
</p>
</statement>
</exercise>
<p>
Since the disease spreads by contact between a susceptible and an
infected individual, we will assume that the number of susceptible
population members
is decreasing (you cannot get the disease twice) and the  rate of
decrease is proportional to the number of susceptible and the number
of infected currently present.  This says that
<me>\dfdx{S}{t}=-aSI</me> for some positive constant, <m>a</m>. The constant <m>a</m> is
called the <term>transmission rate</term>. (Why?)
</p>
<exercise>
<statement>
<p>
  Explain how we know
  that <m>\dfdx{S}{t}</m> must be negative.
</p>
</statement>
</exercise>
<p>
Since the only way to become immune is to
recover from the disease, we also assume that  the rate of change of <m>R</m> is
proportional to the number of infected individuals present.  This
means that <me>\dfdx{R}{t}=bI</me> for some positive constant <m>b</m>. The
constant <m>b</m>
is called the <term>recovery rate</term>. (Why?)

    and use this to show that <m>\dfdxn{I}{t}{2}\lt 0</m> when
    <me>

<!--     </me> -->
<!--     and is positive otherwise. -->
<!--   \end{enumerate} -->
<!-- \end{embeddedproblem-enumerate} -->
<p>
Putting this together we see that the number of infected is increasing
and accelerating when
<me>
\frac{b}{a}+\left(\frac{I}{2}+\sqrt{\left( \frac{I}{2}\right)^2+\frac{bI}{a}}\right)\lt S\lt 1
</me>
and increasing, but slowing down, when
<me>
\frac{b}{a}\lt S\lt \frac{b}{a}+\left(\frac{I}{2}+\sqrt{\left(\frac{I}{2}\right)^2+\frac{bI}{a}}\right).
</me>
When <m>S\lt \frac{b}{a}</m> it is decreasing.

Consider reviewing that problem  before you proceed.

Recall that initially the center of the rear axle of the tractor is at
the origin and the center of the rear axle of the trailer is at the
point <m>(1,0)</m> Also we assumed that the tractor pulls the front wheels
vertically up the <m>y</m>-axis and that the rear wheels don’t slip.

<xref ref="INprob:Tractrix"></xref> we showed that the path followed by
the center of the rear axle of the trailer follows, <m>y=y(t)</m>, must
satisfy the IVP:
<me>
  \label{eq:TractrixIVP-2}
