      Like the authors, your instructor is probably a highly trained,
      professional mathematician. As mathematicians we solve problems and we
      build logical structures. This is what we were trained to do.
    </p>
    <p>
      
      The structures we build are what makes mathematics useful but that is
      not why we build them. Most of the time we create simply for the love
      of the creative act itself. Usefulness, as such, is often a secondary
      consideration. In this, mathematicians are more like poets or artists
      than scientists or engineers. By and large, we consider the act of
      creation to be its own reward. It is a remarkable fact that
      sometimes the logical structures we build turn out to be applicable to
      problems in the real world.
      
    </p>
    
    <aside>
      <title>Comment</title>
      <p>
        This is why mathematicians sometimes seem to be out of touch
        with the real world. Much like poets and artists, when we are
        doing mathematics we actually are out of touch, at least a
        little.
      </p>
    </aside>
    
    
    <p>
      When we explain our mathematical works to each other we mathematicians
      only display the finished product in much the same way that an artist
      or an architect will display their work without all of the
      behind-the-scenes sketches and pencil lines (and mistakes), that they
      made along the way.  We start with simple ideas and bit by bit, piece
      by piece, we assemble our mathematics like we would a puzzle. When we
      explain it to others we ignore all of the mistakes we made along the
      way for the same reason that artists do.  They are not part the
      finished product. That is how we understand, and think about our
      mathematics, and that is how we talk to each other about it. Displayed
      in this manner a mathematical structure is truly as beautiful as any
      artistic creation.
    </p>
    <p>
      But in this text we are not talking to other mathematicians. We are
      talking to you, a mathematics student. And you are (presumably)
      encountering Calculus for the first time. This is not the time to
      build Calculus up from its logical foundations and expect you to
      appreciate its beauty.  This is the time to show you where Calculus
      came from, how it was built, what problems it was invented to solve,
      and, perhaps most importantly, how well Calculus addresses those
      problems. Once that is done you will appreciate it, or not, as your
      own sense of aesthetics allows.
    </p>
    <p>
      As you proceed through this text know that it took several centuries
      for some of the most brilliant persons who have ever lived to polish
      the ideas of Calculus to their current luster. But just as a painting
      is unappealing before it is finished, Calculus is not lustrous until
      you can look back on it as a whole. Until then it takes a lot of
      calculation and thought to see how the ideas work together. In the
      end, we hope you will come to see that it is worth all of the work and
      frustration.
    </p>
    <p>
      In this chapter we will be exploring the <foreign>ad hoc</foreign> techniques
      used by the mathematical pioneers who were trying to solve some very
      real and very specific problems using only the tools that you possess
      now: Geometry, Algebra, and Trigonometry. The pre-Calculus techniques
      they came up with substantially influenced the form that Calculus
      eventually took. If the pioneers had been different people, or if they
      had begun with different tools Calculus would likely have taken a
      different form. Or it might not have been invented at all. The
      pre-Calculus methods we will see in this chapter represent the first
      ideas that eventually led to Calculus. The supporting logical
      structure came later, much later.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus we will begin with the intuitive notions that preceded
      Calculus. But we will not hide the problems inherent in this
      approach. Quite the reverse. It is our intention to highlight
      them as much as possible. The underlying difficulties are real
      and they need to be understood. We want you to be aware of them
      so that in <xref ref="CHAPTERWhatsWrong">Chapter</xref> when
      we begin to address them, the necessity of the rather severe
      formalism we will be forced to adopt will be clear to you.
    </p>
    <p>
      For example, we will soon start talking about <q>the line tangent to a
      curve.</q>  You have a very clear image of what is meant by <q>tangent
      line</q> and that will suffice to begin.  But, it is actually very hard
      to define precisely what we mean by 
      <q>the line tangent to a
      curve.</q>
    </p>

    <aside>
      <title>Comment</title>
      <p>
        You almost certainly don<rsq/>t believe this because nothing could
        be clearer than the image of tangency you have in your
        head. Nevertheless we will eventually see that it is true.
      </p>
    </aside>
    
    <p>
      Later we will encounter a similar difficulty with the idea of a
      continuous curve. The phrase <q>continuous curve</q> surely
      conjures up a very clear image in your mind. Nothing could be
      clearer really. Continuous curves are unbroken curves, right?
      This is so intuitively obvious that no one bothered to define
      the notion of continuity formally for millennia. Most likely you
      don<rsq/>t see the need for a formal definition either. Yet.
      But continuity is very hard to define in a mathematically
      rigorous manner. The first person to give a rigorous definition
      in the modern sense was <url
      href="https://mathshistory.st-andrews.ac.uk/Biographies/Bolzano/"
      visual="https://mathshistory.st-andrews.ac.uk/Biographies/Bolzano/">Bernhard
      Bolzano</url> in 1817.

    </figure>
    <p>
      One of our goals is to set up the conditions under which it will
      become very clear to you why your intuitive image of, for example,  a 
      <q>tangent
      line,</q> or a 
      <q>continuous curve</q> is not sufficient; why these are
      hard concepts to define. We want you to bump into the difficulties
      that come with the intuitive understanding you have right now so that
      you will see <mdash/> and appreciate <mdash/> why the definitions we will
      eventually be offering are better. Or at least more useful.
    </p>
    <p>
      But have some sympathy for the poor instructor! Everything we do in
      the first part of this text, especially in this section, goes directly
      against all of the instructor<rsq/>s training as a
      mathematician.
      Instructors would be much happier with us if we would define the terms
      
      <q>the line tangent to a curve</q> and <q>continuous curve</q> before we use
      them because that is the way they see and appreciate the beauty of our
      topic.

<aside>
<title>Comment</title>

    <p>
      Indeed, it may well go against your own
      sensibilities as well. If you find yourself getting irritated with
      the imprecision of our presentation you may well be a mathematician
      yourself, at least by temperament. In that case, all you lack is
      training and you can get that by changing your
      major to mathematics. Think about it.
      </p>
<p>
If you are not a mathematician at heart then you will probably find <xref ref="DiffCalcFromPractice"></xref>  of the
      text most useful and
      interesting. This is where we will try to elucidate the most
      powerful problem solving tools that came from Calculus and show you
      how to use them. But the problems are only representative. Pay
      attention to the techniques, not to the problems themselves.
    </p>
</aside>

    <p>
      
      The problem is that this is not (in our opinion) a good way to learn
      Calculus. So instead, we will be following in the footsteps of our
      forebears. We will proceed using intuitive ideas until they become too
      unwieldy to use. Only after we have discerned the properties we need from
      a concept (like 
      <q>tangent</q>) will we offer formal
      definitions. Hopefully it will then be clear to you why the
      definitions are needed, and why they are stated as they are.
    </p>

    <p>
      So to the instructor, or anyone else of a mathematical bent who
      might be reading this, we offer our apologies for proceeding in
      what we know looks like the wrong way around. As mathematicians
      ourselves we certainly feel the same discomfort you do. But in
      this text we are not writing as mathematicians for other
      mathematicians, we are writing as teachers for students. Please
      bear with us. <url

      Muses surrounding Tartaglia and observing the trajectory of a
      cannonball.  This represents the fact that this was one of the first
      works which studied the science of projectile motion using
      mathematical principles rather than empirical data and guesswork.  At
      the door of the larger ring is Euclid, representing the notion that

      <title>Historical Background</title>
      <p>
        In those days there wasn<rsq/>t a clear distinction between
        Geometry and mathematics.
      </p>
    </aside>

    <p>
      The caption below the illustration means, <q>The Mathematical
      sciences speak: Who wishes to know the various causes of things,
      learn about us.  The way is open to all.</q>
    </p>
    <p>
      From the beginning of the Renaissance to the present day the use
      of mathematics to describe and analyze physical phenomena has
      become ever the more normal mode of analysis in science. At
      first the Geometry of the Greeks, including Trigonometry, was at
      the forefront, but as time went on newer methods were
      invented. Primary among these were Algebra and then, eventually,
      Calculus.
    </p>
    <p>
      Algebra came first but it merged with Geometry to form what we
      now call Analytic Geometry. When Calculus was invented it
      supplemented, enhanced, and expanded its predecessors.
    </p>
    <p>
      None of the other fields of mathematics disappeared. Geometry,
      Trigonometry, Algebra, and Analytic Geometry remain very useful
      tools in science. But they have, in a sense, become subordinate
      to Calculus.
    </p>
    <p>
      There are physical problems that are very difficult to solve
      using either Algebra or Geometry but which become relatively
      easy once Calculus has been mastered.  Attempts to address those
      difficult-to-solve problems are what led to the invention of
      Calculus and several of the very ingenious techniques developed
      were very Calculus-like. In this chapter we will look briefly at
      some of these pre-Calculus techniques.
    </p>
    <p>
      <alert>Warning:</alert> You may be tempted to disregard this
      chapter and get on to <q>the Calculus part.</q> This is an
      error.  The story of Calculus, what sorts of problems it was
      invented to address, and why the tools of Calculus developed in
      the way that they did, will help you understand what Calculus
      is, and what it is not.

    <title>The Laziness of Nature</title>
    

    <p>
      <idx><h>Vocabulary</h><h>optimization</h></idx>
      In order to apply mathematical principles to the study of
      physical phenomena we need to agree on some foundational
      assumptions which seem to govern the behavior of nature.  A
      fundamental tenet that scientists use is this: <em>Nature is
      lazy!</em> That is, nature optimizes. It tries to do things in
      the most efficient (optimal) manner possible. The most common
      form such <term>Optimization Problems</term> take is to find the
      value of the independent variable (often denoted <m>x</m>) which
      makes the dependent variable (often denoted <m>y</m>) as large
      or as small as possible.
    </p>
    <p>
      To illustrate the usefulness of this principle consider a beam
      of light bouncing off of a flat mirror. Empirical evidence (that
      is, evidence gained from measuring the angles) suggests that the
      angle of incidence is equal to the angle of reflection. However,
      no matter how many experiments we run there is always the chance
      that there is some configuration of lights and mirrors we<rsq/>ve
      missed. A configuration where the angles are not equal.
    </p>
    <p>
      
      Let<rsq/>s try a thought experiment.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      We want to discover what path a beam of light would travel between the
      points <m>A</m> and <m>B</m> in the figure below assuming that it first reflects
      off of the line <m>m</m> (<m>m</m> for mirror, not slope).
    </p>
    <image source="DC/ReflectingMirror1.png" width="80%" />
    
    <p>
      <idx><h>Vocabulary</h><h>optimization</h></idx>
      From our assumption that <em>Nature is Lazy</em>, it is clear
      that our task is to find the shortest path from <m>A</m> to
      <m>m</m> to <m>B</m>. That is, we have an <term>Optimization
      Problem.</term>
    </p>
    <aside>
      <title>Comment</title>

      <p>
        Actually we want to minimize the amount of time it takes to
        pass between two points, but for this problem minimizing the
        time and minimizing the distance are equivalent. The modern
        name for this idea is the <q>Principle of Least Action.</q>
      </p>
    </aside>
    
    
    <p>
      
      Begin by reflecting <m>B</m> across <m>m</m> in our imagination and
      denote this reflection by <m>B_R</m>.
    </p>
    <image source="DC/ReflectingMirror2.png" width="60%" />
<p>
Clearly if the mirror were not present then the solid line from <m>A</m> to <m>B_R</m> in the figure above will
be shorter than any other path from <m>A</m> to <m>B_R</m>. For example it is shorter than the dotted path
from <m>A</m> to <m>B_R</m>.
</p>
    <p>
      
      Next we reflect <m>B_R</m> back across <m>m</m> so that it falls onto <m>B</m>, and
      we reflect those portions of the solid and
      dotted paths that are below line <m>m</m> in the same way.

      <p>
        A reasonable guess is that the correct shape is a
        square. But a guess, no matter how much it feels right, is
        just a guess. We need a convincing demonstration.
      </p>
      <p>
        To see that this actually is the correct shape, consider a
        square whose side is <m>s</m>. If <m>s</m> is the length of
        one side then the perimeter of our square is (the fixed
        value) <m>4s</m> and the area is <m>s^2</m> (also
        fixed). 

        Suppose we now increase the length of one of the
        two pairs of opposite sides by <m>x</m>. To maintain the same perimeter,
        we must also decrease the length of the other pair of sides by
        the same <m>x</m>. The area of this new rectangle is
        <me>(s-x)(s+x)=s^2-x^2\lt{}s^2</me>
        but its perimeter is still <m>4s</m>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Thus the <m>s\times s</m> square has a larger area than the  <m>(s-x) \times (s+x)</m> rectangle with the same
        perimeter. Moreover, since we didn<rsq/>t specify a value for <m>x</m> our
        conclusion holds for all possible values of <m>x</m>. That is, every
        rectangle with perimeter <m>4s</m> has a smaller area than the square
        with perimeter <m>4s</m>.

        It is easy to have the impression that using a letter, like
        <m>s</m>, to represent quantity automatically means that the
        quantity can vary <mdash/> that it is <q>variable.</q> This is
        not true.  There are three situations in which a letter is
        used to represent a given quantity.

              <idx><h>Vocabulary</h><h>variable</h></idx>
              For example, the area of a square is given by
              <m>A=x^2,</m> where <m>x</m> is the length of one side.
              If we think of <m>x</m> as a <term>variable</term> <mdash/>
              if it can take on any positive value <mdash/> then this
              expression gives us the area of all possible squares.

              Sometimes letters are used to designate unchanging
              quantities <mdash/> <term>constants</term> (also called
              <term>parameters</term>) <mdash/> when the actual value of
              the constant is irrelevant. For example, the area of all
              rectangles where one side is some fixed value, say
              <m>c</m>, but the other varies is given by <m>A = c\cdot
              x,</m> where <m>x</m> is variable as before. Since we
              don<rsq/>t care what the size of the fixed side is we don<rsq/>t
              choose a specific length for it. We just let <m>c</m>
              represent that fixed size, whatever it is.  The crucial
              fact here is that we have a rectangle, not what size the
              rectangle is.

              The difference between <term>variables</term> and
              <term>constants</term> is mostly in the way we think about
              them. Constants are fixed, but unknown. Variables are not
              fixed.

              Sometimes a varying quantity depends on the values
              of one or more other varying quantities. In that case the
              dependent variable is said to be a <term>function</term> of the
              independent variable. We saw this above when we said the area of a
              rectangle with a fixed side length, <m>c</m>, was
              <me>
                A=c\cdot x.
              </me>
              Most often we would write this as
              <me>
                A(x)=c\cdot x.
              </me>
              The <q><m>(x)</m></q> part of <q><m>A(x)</m></q> just tells
              us that that the dependent variable <m>A</m> depends on
              is the independent variable <m>x</m>. 
            </p>
            
            <p>
              If you are inclined to be persnickety, you can make a
              reasonable argument that if <m>A(x)=cx</m> then
              <m>A</m> depends on both <m>c</m> and <m>x</m>. And
              you<rsq/>d be right. But the tradition is to only put
              variables inside the parentheses, not parameters.

        These are simple distinctions now, but it will be useful for you to
        get in the habit of making sure it is clear in your mind what is
        variable, what is constant, and which variables are functions of
        other variables. As the problems get more complex and we need
        several variables, parameters, and functions, just untangling all of
        this can become problematic. Keep in mind that the distinction is
        purely in how we choose to
        <q>think about</q> a given symbol, not in
        how we manipulate it algebraically.

        The following problem is a variation on
        <xref ref="EXAMPLEFixedPerimeter">Example</xref> and can be solved similarly.

        As we mentioned above, <xref
        ref="PROBLEMScienceBeforeCalc1">Problem</xref> can be done in a
        manner similar to <xref ref="EXAMPLEFixedPerimeter">Example</xref>.
        But what about the following?
      </p>
      
      <example xml:id="EXAMPLEScienceBeforeCalc2">
        
        <p>
          Consider all square based boxes with a fixed surface area
          <m>S</m>. Does the cube enclose the largest volume?
        </p>
        <p>
          
          To do this problem in the same manner as <xref
          ref="EXAMPLEFixedPerimeter">Example</xref>, observe that a cube
          with side <m>s</m> would have a volume of <m>s^3</m> and a
          surface area of <m>6s^2</m>. Suppose we change the lengths on
          the base from <m>s</m> to <m>s+x</m>.  Notice that if
          <m>x\gt0</m> then we will be increasing the lengths on the
          base and if <m>x\lt0</m> then we will be decreasing the
          lengths.  The only restriction is that <m>0\lt s+x</m> so as
          to be a length.  This says that <m>-s\lt x\lt\infty</m>. (In
          theory, we can make the lengths of the base as long as we
          wish.)  To maintain a surface area of <m>6s^2</m>, we will
          need to adjust our height appropriately.  Let’s call this new
          height <m>h</m>.

      In its simplest form an <term>Optimization Problem</term> can be described
      as follows: Given that <m>y</m> depends on <m>x</m>, find the value of <m>x</m> that
      makes <m>y</m> as large (or as small) as it can possibly be.
    </p>
    <p>
      
      For example, if <m>y=x^2-\frac{29}{21}x+\frac{10}{21}</m> then <m>y</m> will be
      as small as it can possibly be when <m>x=\frac{29}{42}</m>. The question
      is, how did we find <m>x=\frac{29}{42}</m>?

      One of the mathematicians who developed techniques for solving

      de Fermat</url> (1601<ndash/>1665) who created what has been called the
      <em>Method of Adequalty</em>. (The Latin root 
<foreign>adequāre</foreign> means to equalize.  When
      something is adequate, then it is equal to the need.) Fermat<rsq/>s method was based on the simple
      observation that if the maximum value of <m>y</m> occurs when <m>x</m> is equal
      to say, <m>6</m>, then when <m>x</m> is very near <m>6</m>, <m>y</m> will almost be equal

      <p>
        Since there is only one number associated with each day of the
        year this should be a discrete graph, but we<rsq/>re more
        interested in continuous functions so we<rsq/>ve connected the
        dots to create a continuous approximation.
      </p>
    </aside>
    <p>
      You can see this in the graph above.  Notice that the maximum
      number of daylight hours (about <m>14.5</m>) occurs just after
      <m>169</m> days (in fact, at day <m>172</m>) and that for
      several days before or after we have about the same number of
      hours of daylight.  This is also true near the minimum which
      occurs at day <m>356</m>. Regardless of what the variables
      represent if the graph of a function, <m>f(x)</m>, is continuous
      then <m>f(x+h)\approx f(x)</m> near a maximum or minimum: as
      long as <m>h</m> is not too big.
    </p>
    

    <p>
      Fermat<rsq/>s simple idea was to purposely make the mistake of
      setting <m>f(x+h)</m> actually equal  to
      <m>f(x)</m>.  He then rearranged the formulas algebraically and
      at the crucial point he would set <m>h=0</m> to <q>make it
      correct.</q> An example will make this clearer.
    </p>


    <example xml:id="EXAMPLESquareMinimalPerimeter">
      <p>
        In <xref ref="EXAMPLEFixedPerimeter">Example</xref>, we showed
        that out of all rectangles with a fixed perimeter, the one
        with the largest area is a square. Next we will use Fermat<rsq/>s
        Method of Adequality to examine the related question: Out of
        all rectangles with a fixed area, does a square have the
        smallest perimeter?
      </p>
      <p>
        
        Consider a rectangle whose length is given by <m>x</m> and width is given
        by <m>y</m>. The area of the rectangle is given by <m>A=xy</m> and the
        perimeter is given by <m>P=2x+2y</m>.
      </p>
      <image source="DC/GenericRectangle.png" width="50%"/>
        
      <p>
        The problem is to minimize <m>P</m> while holding <m>A</m> constant. More
        precisely, our objective is to minimize the function <m>P=2x+2y</m>,
        subject to the constraint that the area, <m>A=xy</m>, is fixed. First, we
        will use our constraint <m>A=xy</m> to eliminate one of the variables and
        substitute into <m>P</m>. Solving for <m>y,</m> we get <m>y=A/x</m>. Then,
        <me>
          P=P(x) = 2x+\frac{2A}{x}.
        </me>
        We have used function notation for <m>P(x)</m> to emphasize that <m>P</m> is a
        function of <m>x</m> alone.  (Remember that <m>A</m> is constant or
        
        <q>fixed.</q>)
      </p>
      <p>
        
        Fermat<rsq/>s method says to first set
        <me>
          P(x+h)=P(x).
        </me>
        This gives:
        
        <mdn>
          <mrow  xml:id="equationFermAd1">
            2(\textcolor{red}{x}+h)+\frac{2A}{x+h}=2\textcolor{red}{x}+\frac{2A}{x}.
          </mrow>
        </mdn>
        Rearranging a bit, we get
        <md>
          <mrow>
            \textcolor{red}{2x}+\textcolor{blue}{2}h+\frac{\textcolor{blue}{2}A}{x+h}\amp{}=\textcolor{red}{2x}+\frac{\textcolor{blue}{2}A}{x}
          </mrow>
        </md>
        so that 
        <md>
          <mrow>
            h\amp{}=\frac{A}{x}-\frac{A}{x+h}.
          </mrow>
        </md>
        Adding the fractions gives
        <mdn>
          <mrow  xml:id="EQUATIONFermAd6">
            h\amp{}=\frac{A(x+h)-Ax}{x(x+h)}=\frac{Ah}{x(x+h)}. 
          </mrow>
        </mdn>
        Finally, and crucially, dividing both sides   by <m>h,</m> gives
        <mdn>
          <mrow  xml:id="EQUATIONFermAd7">
            1\amp{}=\frac{A}{x(x+h)}.
          </mrow>
        </mdn>
        
      </p>
      
      <p>
        
        Earlier we had made the
        <q>mistake</q> of setting <m>P(x+h)=P(x)</m>
        (knowing that this is not true). Now we
        <q>make it correct</q> by
        setting <m>h=0</m>. This gives: <m> 1=\frac{A}{x^2}, \text{ or } x^2=A.  </m>
        Substituting this into <m>y=\frac{A}{x},</m> we get
        <m>y=\frac{A}{x}=\frac{x^2}{x}=x</m>.
      </p>
      <p>
        
        Thus <m>P</m> is minimum when <m>y=x,</m> which is to say, when the rectangle
        is actually a square. A moment<rsq/>s thought should make it clear that
        there is no maximum value for <m>P</m>.
      </p>
      <p>
        
        
        Fermat<rsq/>s method is very slick.  However it contains an inherent
        logical flaw.  We begin by setting <m>P(x+h)</m> equal to <m>P(x)</m>, even
        though we know we are making an error. This seems like it might be a
        flaw but it really isn<rsq/>t. When we set <m>P(x+h)=P(x)</m> we are asking,
        
        <q>What happens if they are equal?</q> The computations leading up to
        <xref ref="EQUATIONFermAd7">equation</xref> are the answer to that question.
      </p>
      <p>
        
        But notice that we got from <xref ref="EQUATIONFermAd6">equation</xref> to
        <xref ref="EQUATIONFermAd7">equation</xref> by dividing by <m>h</m>. But we know  that we can only divide by <m>h</m> if <m>h</m> is not
        zero. Fortunately it is clear that <m>h\ne0</m> since the whole point of
        introducing <m>h</m> is for <m>x+h</m> and <m>x</m> to be two different values.
        However, in the final step, after <xref ref="EQUATIONFermAd7">equation</xref>,
        we took <m>h=0</m> to
        <q>make it correct</q> but if <m>h</m> is zero then we
        couldn<rsq/>t have divided by <m>h</m>. We seem to be chasing our tails. We
        need for <m>h</m> to be equal to zero and not be equal to zero at the
        same time!
      </p>
      <p>

      <xref ref="DRILLMethAdeq"></xref> shows that Fermat<rsq/>s method does not
      indicate whether the computed value of <m>x</m> is at a maximum or a
      minimum. Often the context of the problem provides the additional
      information needed to make that
      determination. <xref ref="EXAMPLESquareMinimalPerimeter">Example</xref> and

    <exercise  xml:id="PROBLEMRectSolid">
      <introduction>
        <p>
          Consider a rectangular box with a square base, as seen here.
        </p>
        
        <image source="DC/RectSolid.png" width="25%"/>

      <task>
        <statement>
          <p>
            Find a formula for the volume, <m>V</m>, and the surface area, <m>S</m>,

          <p>
            Suppose we want to determine which box has the least surface
            area, given a fixed volume. What is our objective and what is our
            constraint? Use Fermat<rsq/>s Method of Adequality to find the
            dimensions of the box that solves this problem. Is the minimal box
            a cube?
          </p>
        </statement>
      </task>
</exercise>
    
    <p>
      
      A few minutes of thought should convince you that what makes Fermat<rsq/>s
      method work is the fact that near a maximum or minimum, the curve is
      practically horizontal. That is, its slope is nearly zero.
    </p>
    <p>
      
      Fermat recognized that finding a maximum or minimum by his method was
      a special case of finding the slope of (the line tangent to) the curve
      and he modified his method to determine the slope of a curve even when
      it is not horizontal.
    </p>
    <p>
      
      Before we pursue Fermat<rsq/>s modification, it might be a good time to
      brush up on some basics regarding the slopes of lines.  No doubt you
      are already familiar with all of the following formulas for the
      equation of a line:
    </p>
    
    <p>
      <dl>
        <li>
          <title>Slope-Intercept formula:</title>
          <p><m>y=mx+b</m></p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <title>Point-Slope formula:</title>
          <p>  <m>y-y_0=m(x-x_0)</m></p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <title>Two-Point, or Point-Point formula:</title>
          <p>  <m>y-y_0=\dfrac{y_1-y_0}{x_1-x_0}(x-x_0)</m></p>
        </li>
      </dl>
    </p>
    
    <p>
      
      These formulas are all really just rearrangements of one another. We
      use three different rearrangements because in different contexts one
      of them is usually simpler to use than the others. Through most of
      Calculus you will probably find the Point-Slope version to be the
      most convenient to use.

      Now that you<rsq/>ve had a chance to brush up on slopes, let<rsq/>s see how
      Fermat modified his method to determine the slope of a
      curve.  We will start by determining the slope of the graph of
      <m>y=x^2</m> at the point <m>(1,1)</m>.
    </p>


    <aside>
      <title>Comment</title>
      <p>
        That is to say, the slope of the line tangent to the graph of
        <m>y=x^2</m> at the point <m>(1,1)</m>..
      </p>
    </aside>
    

    <p>

      We need two points to determine the slope of a line, so with Fermat<rsq/>s
      method in mind, we choose another point on the curve <m>y=x^2</m> very
      close to <m>(1,1)</m>. Since we don<rsq/>t really care which point we take as
      long as it is close to <m>(1,1)</m> we introduce the parameter, <m>h,</m> which
      we think of as very small. The points <m>(1,1)</m> and <m>(1+h,(1+h)^2)</m> are
      thus very close together. This is represented in the sketch below.
    </p>
    <image source="DC/Aedequality1.png" width="30%"/>

    <p>

      The slope of secant line joining <m>(1,1)</m> and <m>(1+h,(1+h)^2)</m> is given
      by
      <md>
        <mrow>\frac{(1+h)^2-1}{(1+h)-1}\amp{}=\frac{1+2h+h^2-1}{h}</mrow>
        <mrow>\amp{}=2+h</mrow>
        </md>.
        As before we set <m>h=0</m>. Thus the slope of the line tangent to the
        graph of <m>y=x^2</m> at <m>(1,1 )</m> is <m>2</m>.

      As we noted earlier, while Fermat<rsq/>s Method of Adequality seems to work
      it has a fundamental logical flaw. Fermat<rsq/>s

        The
        English word,
        <q>normal</q> comes from the Latin word <foreign>norma</foreign>
        which literally means a carpenter<rsq/>s square. In construction, it is
        important that vertical posts be perpendicular to the horizontal
        ground, so a vertical post is normal.

      Descartes<rsq/>s method is often called the Method of Normals  because what he actually
      finds is the line normal to (perpendicular to) a curve.  Once the line
      normal to the curve at a point is obtained, the line perpendicular to
      the normal line will be tangent to the curve.  Descartes<rsq/> Method
      relies solely on the fact (from  Geometry) that at each point of
      a circle the radius and tangent line through the point are
      perpendicular.  We<rsq/>ll illustrate Descartes<rsq/> idea with the following
      example.
    </p>

    <example xml:id="EXAMPLEDescartesNormal1">
      
      
      <p>
        To find the slope of the normal (and, eventually the tangent) line
        to the graph of the curve <m>y=\sqrt{2x}</m> at the point <m>(2,2)</m>
        Descartes<rsq/> approach was to look at the family of circles with
        centers on the <m>x</m>-axis and passing through the point <m>(2,2)</m>. The
        sketch below displays several members of of that family of
        circles.  
      </p>
      <image source="DC/DescartesCircle.png" width="70%"/>
      <p>
        Notice that each circle crosses the parabola at the point
        <m>(2,2)</m>. We are searching for the center of the solid black circle
        which touches (is tangent to) the parabola at <m>(2,2)</m>. If we can
        find the center of the black circle then the radial line through the
        point <m>(2,2)</m> will be normal to the parabola at <m>(2,2)</m> and the
        slope of the tangent line will be the negative reciprocal of the
        slope of the normal.
      </p>
      <aside>
        <title>Historical Context</title>
        <p>
          Descartes and Fermat are generally credited with the invention of
          Analytic Geometry which is a technique that allows us to move
          problems from Algebra to Geometry or, as in this problem, from
          Geometry to Algebra.
        </p>
      </aside>
      
      <p>
        We now want to turn the geometric problem of finding the
        intersection of our circle and parabola into an algebraic problem.
        Let <m>(a,0)</m> denote the coordinates of the center of a circle in that
        family, then the equation of the circle with center <m>(a,0)</m> is
        <m>(x-a)^2+y^2=r^2</m> where <m>r</m> is the length of the radius of the
        circle and <m>a</m> is a parameter. Since we require our circle to pass
        through the point <m>(2,2)</m> the length of this radius will be the
        distance from <m>(2,2)</m> to <m>(a,0)</m>, <m>r=\sqrt{(2-a)^2+2^2}</m>. Thus we
        have
        <men  xml:id="EQDescartes1">(x-a)^2+y^2=(2-a)^2+2^2</men>.
      </p>
      <p>
        
        Since we are looking for the point where <m>y=\sqrt{2x}</m> and the
        circle intersect, we substitute <m>y=\sqrt{2x}</m> into
        <xref ref="EQDescartes1">equation</xref>) to get
        <mdn>
          <mrow number="no">  (x-a)^2+2x\amp{}=(2-a)^2+4</mrow>
          <mrow number="no">  x^2-2ax+a^2+2x\amp{}=4-4a+a^2+4 </mrow>
          <mrow xml:id="EQNormQuad">         x^2+(2-2a)x+(4a-8)\amp{}=0</mrow>
          </mdn>.
      </p>
      <p>
        
        At this point it is tempting to use the Quadratic Formula to solve
        for <m>x</m> and get (typically) two distinct solutions for <m>x</m> in terms
        of <m>a</m>. But the fact is we really don<rsq/>t care about the variable
        <m>x</m>. We want to find the value of <m>a</m> which ensures that the circle
        and the curve intersect exactly once.
      </p>
      <p>
        
        Think about this for a moment. When we use the Quadratic
        Formula to solve this equation we get a single solution
        precisely when the discriminant (the part under the square
        root) is zero.
      </p>
    </example>


    <exercise xml:id="DRILLHuddeDiscriminant">
      <statement>
        <p>
          Use the Quadratic Formula to show that the discriminant of
          <xref ref="EQNormQuad">equation</xref> is
          <m>(2-2a)^2-4(4a-8)</m>.  Setting this equal to zero and
          solving, we get

          <md>
            <mrow>
              4-8a+4a^2-16a+32\amp{}=0
            </mrow>
            <mrow> 4(a^2-6a+9)\amp{}=0</mrow>
            <mrow> 4(a-3)^2\amp{}=0</mrow>
            <mrow> a\amp{}=3,</mrow>
          </md>
          So the center of the circle touching the curve only once is at
          <m>(3, 0)</m> and the line segment from <m>(3,0)</m> to <m>(2,2)</m> is normal
          (perpendicular) to the graph of <m>y=\sqrt{2x}</m>.

      <statement>
        <p>
          Descartes would not have approached this problem using the idea of
          a discriminant as we just did.  He knew that the only way the
          circle and the parabola could be tangent at <m>x=2</m> is if <m>2</m> is a
          double root of <xref ref="EQNormQuad">equation</xref>.  Since a quadratic
          polynomial only has two roots, this means that
          <xref ref="EQNormQuad">equation</xref> must be

          <mdn>
            <mrow xml:id="EQUATIONDoubleRoot1">  (x-2)^2=0=x^2-4x+4</mrow>
            </mdn>.
            By comparing the coefficients of <xref ref="EQNormQuad">equation</xref>) and
            the right side of <xref ref="EQUATIONDoubleRoot1">equation</xref> show that <m>a=3</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </exercise>
    <p>
      Like any powerful tool, Analytic Geometry must be used
      carefully. Sometimes, as in this problem, the transition from
      Geometry to Algebra can generate algebraic solutions that have no
      corresponding geometric solution. An extraneous root is the most
      common example of this.

          <xref ref="EXAMPLEDescartesNormal1">Example</xref>).  When <m>a\lt{}2</m> we get one
          positive and one negative root, but the parabola and the circle

      <xref ref="EXAMPLEDescartesNormal1">Example</xref> illustrates that there is a
      significant difference between curves touching (curves that are
      tangent) and curves crossing (curves that intersect). Finding the
      line tangent to a curve is actually much more subtle than you would
      expect at first. But this is not the appropriate place to start that
      conversation so we will hold off until we reach

      But it is algebraically cumbersome because it requires that we find

      <q>double root</q> of a polynomial. Double roots of quadratic
      functions like the one in <xref ref="EXAMPLEDescartesNormal1">Example</xref> are

      this problem is almost insurmountable without Calculus.

        Descartes and Fermat were co-creators of Analytic Geometry <mdash/> the use
        of Algebra to solve geometric problems <mdash/> so their methods are
        simultaneously algebraic and geometric in nature. That is, their
        methods are static. There is no motion involved.  But at it<rsq/>s heart,
        Calculus gives us a way of dealing with the properties of objects as
        they change. It is the mathematics of motion. So we will need to think
        more dynamically.
      </p>
      <p>
        <idx><h>Vocabulary</h><h>with respect to</h></idx>
        If quantity <m>A</m> changes by <m>\Delta A</m> each time quantity <m>B</m> changes
        by <m>\Delta B</m> we say that the rate of change of <m>A</m> <term>with respect
        to</term> <m>B</m> is <m>\frac{\Delta A}{\Delta B}</m>.
      </p>
      <p>
        For example, in a video game if your character gains one hundred hit
        points whenever you cast a certain spell we would say that the rate of
        change of your hit points is one hundred points per spell, denoted
        <m>100 \frac{\text{points}}{\text{spell}}</m>. If you gain fifty hit points
        every second time you quaff a potion we write
        <m>\frac{50\ \text{points}}{2\ \text{quaffs}}</m> or, equivalently,
        <m>25 \frac{\text{points}}{\text{quaff}}</m> and we say that the rate of
        change of hit points with respect to quaffs is twenty-five. Notice how
        naturally the properties of fractions come into play:
        <m>\frac{50\ \text{points}}{2\ \text{quaffs}} = 25
        \frac{\text{points}}{\text{quaff}}</m>.
      </p>
      <p>
        On the other hand if you lose <m>15</m> hit points each time an enemy
        strikes you three times with a sword then your hit points are
        decreasing at a rate of
        <m>\frac{15\ \text{points}}{3\ \text{strikes}} = 5
        \frac{\text{points}}{\text{strike}}</m>. 
        It is inconvenient to specify whether <m>A</m> is increasing or decreasing
        verbally so we adopt the convention that a negative rate of change is
        decreasing and a positive rate of change is increasing.

      <p>
        <idx><h>Vocabulary</h><h>rate of change</h></idx>
        Speed is the rate of change we are most familiar with in daily life.
        If you are driving on a flat, straight, road your speed is the
        <term>rate of change</term> of your position, <m>\Delta x</m>, <term>with respect
        to</term> the passage (change) of time, <m>\Delta t</m>.  If your speedometer
        reads <m>60</m> we say your speed is sixty miles per hour:
        <m>60 \frac{\text{miles}}{\text{hour}}</m>, meaning of course that in one
        hour you will travel sixty miles. This is often abbreviated to <m>60</m>
        mph. We will model a flat, straight, road as the <m>x</m>-axis with the
        positive direction to the right, as is customary. Of course, on this
        flat, straight, road we could be going
        <m>60 \frac{\text{miles}}{\text{hour}}</m> to the right or to the
        left. Since there are only two directions possible, we can again use
        negative numbers to indicate the direction of travel as depicted in
        the sketch below.

      <aside>
        <title>Comment</title>
        <p>
          At least that<rsq/>s what we say in the United States. In most of the
          rest of the world it would mean your speed is <m>60

        but in different directions. That is, the <term>speed</term>
        of each car is <m>60 \frac{\text{miles}}{\text{hour}}</m>. But
        it should be clear that a single number is not adequate to
        fully describe the motion of these cars. We also need to
        specify the direction of travel and simply using plus or minus
        is no longer sufficient.

        When we specify the speed and direction of motion of some
        object we are stating its <term>velocity</term>. This can be
        difficult at first because in casual conversation we use the
        words speed and velocity interchangeably, so we tend to think
        of them as synonyms.  But in a technical setting speed and
        velocity, while related, have different
        meanings. <term>Speed</term> is how fast we<rsq/>re going. In <xref ref="FIGUREVector1"></xref> the speed of all of the cars is <m>60
        \frac{\text{miles}}{\text{hour}}</m>. But their
        <term>velocities</term> are all different. The velocity of one
        car is <m>60 \frac{\text{miles}}{\text{hour}}</m> to the
        north, the velocity of another is <m>60
        \frac{\text{miles}}{\text{hour}}</m> to the west, the velocity
        of a third is <m>60 \frac{\text{miles}}{\text{hour}}</m> to
        the southeast, and so on.

        A contemporary of Fermat and Descartes, <url

        visual="https://mathshistory.st-andrews.ac.uk/Biographies/Roberval/">Gilles
        Personne de Roberval</url> (1602<ndash/>1675), used arrows to
        indicate the velocity of moving objects just as we have. The
        length of the arrow represents the speed of the object and the
        direction of travel is the direction that the arrow
        points. This works well in the kind of geometric arguments he
        used as it enabled him to develop a method for constructing
        tangents which is dynamic in nature.

        Of course, if you turn around and walk against the sidewalk, then
        your speed  would be <m>1 \frac{\text{foot}}{\text{second}}</m>.

      <p>
        If you are walking against the sidewalk but slower than the sidewalk
        is moving, say at <m>2 \frac{\text{feet}}{\text{second}}</m>, then you are
        again moving at
        <m>1 \frac{\text{foot}}{\text{second}}</m> but in the other direction.

        Since there are only two possible directions all this could have been
        done without arrows by just adding signed numbers where the sign
        indicates the direction: <m>3+ 4=7</m>, <m>3+(-4)=-1</m>, <m>3+(-2) =1</m>, but what
        if there are more directions available?
      </p>
      <p>

        Using arrows allows us to bring this discussion into a more general
        setting. In the examples above notice that the resulting velocity (the
        black arrow) was always obtained by attaching the tail of the green or
        red arrow to the head of the blue arrow.
      </p>
      <p>
        This works equally well if more directions are available, like when we
        are moving in a plane instead of on a straight line.
      </p>
      <p>

        For example, suppose we are swimming across a river at a speed of
        <m> 2 \frac{\text{feet}}{\text{second}} </m> and the river is flowing at
        <m>3 \frac{\text{feet}}{\text{second}}</m>.  Assuming that we are swimming
        perpendicular to the current, we have the situation depicted in <xref ref="EXERCISEVectorAddition"></xref> below.

        In general you can think of the velocity of an object moving
        in a plane as being compounded of a horizontal velocity (the
        blue arrow in <xref ref="EXERCISEVectorAddition"></xref>)
        and a vertical velocity (the red arrow in <xref
        ref="EXERCISEVectorAddition"></xref>).  This is easiest to
        think about when the component velocities are perpendicular
        but this isn<rsq/>t strictly necessary. For example, you don<rsq/>t need
        to be swimming perpendicular to the current. As seen in  <xref ref="FIGUREVectorAddition"></xref> below to find the result of two
        non-perpendicular velocities (the solid red and blue arrows)
        we need only form the parallelogram as shown. The resulting
        velocity is then represented by the black diagonal arrow.

        Roberval assumed that a curve in the plane is generated by a point
        whose motion is an aggregate of two known motions, which can be
        represented as arrows. The arrows are then
        <q>added</q> by finding the
        diagonal of the parallelogram generated by them. This
        diagonal will point in the direction of motion at that point on the
        curve. And it will point tangent to the curve.

          Suppose a point is moving in the plane so that its horizontal speed
          is <m>1</m> unit per second and its vertical velocity is <m>2</m> units per
          second as in the diagram below.

 Clearly our point is moving
          along the line <m>y=2x</m>.
          If <m>t</m> represents time in seconds and if the point
          starts at the origin, then its coordinates are given by
          <m>x(t)=t</m> and <m>y(t)=2t</m>.  Since both <m>x</m> and
          <m>y</m> are needed to locate the point we will join them
          together notationally like this:
          <me>
            P(t)=
            \ParamEqTwo{x(t)}{y(t)}
            =\ParamEqTwo{t}{2t}

            Observe that <m>x(t) = t</m> is the algebraic representation
            of a horizontal arrow with length <m>t</m>, and <m>y(t) =
            2t</m> is the algebraic representation of a vertical arrow
            with length <m>2t</m>. Translating statements and concepts
            between Algebra and Geometry is the essence of Analytic
            Geometry.

          You might quite reasonably ask why we<rsq/>ve gone to all
          this bother just to have two different ways to represent a
          particular line: <m>y=2x</m>, and
          <m>P(t)=\ParamEqTwo{t}{2t}</m> The difference is in how we
          <q>think about</q> the graph. When we write <m>y=2x</m> we
          are thinking of the entire graph. When we write <m> P(t)=
          \ParamEqTwo{x(t)}{y(t)} </m> there is an implicit
          understanding that (<m>t</m>)ime is passing and we are
          thinking about the motion of the point.  Thus when
          <m>t=1</m> the point is at <m>(1,2)</m> when <m>t=2</m>
          it<rsq/>s at <m>(2,4)</m>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Think of the line as a road. The formula <m>y=2x</m> describes
          the entire road, whereas the expression <m> P(t)=
          \ParamEqTwo{x(t)}{y(t)} = \ParamEqTwo{t}{2t} </m> tells us the
          point<rsq/>s location on the road at any given time, <m>t</m>.

          The idea of representing velocities with arrows is quite a
          powerful and common technique for representing non-linear
          motion. Roberval used this technique to find the tangent lines
          of the conic sections (as we will soon see) as well as more
          general curves. Since Roberval<rsq/>s time this idea has been
          developed considerably beyond what Roberval did. In fact we
          are skirting the edge of some very deep ideas here. In modern
          terms these arrows would be called <term>vectors</term>.
          Using this terminology <term>Vector Addition</term> is then done by the
          <term>Parallelogram Rule</term>, which is essentially what we
          did in <xref ref="FIGUREVectorAddition"></xref>: Form the parallelogram and find its
          diagonal.  The full force of vector analysis was not available
          to Roberval, and we won<rsq/>t need it either so we will not take you any
          further down this path but we encourage you visualize
          velocities, and any other directed quantity, as composed of
          horizontal and vertical components whenever you can. You will
          see this representation in more detail later in your education
          and it will help if you have already begun thinking in these
          terms.

        <p>
          Parabolas, ellipses, and hyperbolas are called conic sections, or just
          conics, because they were originally defined as the intersection of a
          cone with planes situated at various angles, as shown in the sketches
below.
        </p>
   <image source="DC/ConicSections.png" width="50%"/>
        <p>
          While interesting, the original geometric definitions won<rsq/>t do for our
          purposes because they are entirely static. There is
          no motion involved.

        <aside>
          <title>Historical Context</title>
          <p>
            This is primarily because we depend very heavily on our
            modern algebraic notation, not because of any inherent flaw in the
            definition. Without any notation at all ancient Greek scholars
            understood the nature of parabolas at least as well as we do
            today. Possibly better.
          </p>

          That <m>\alpha</m> and <m>\beta</m>  are congruent in <xref
          ref="PROBLEMparall-rhombus"></xref> has an
          interesting consequence in optics. Imagine that the inside of our
          parabola is a mirror, and that a light source has been placed at the
          point <m>F</m>. As we have seen when light reflects off of a flat mirror
          the angle of incidence is equal to the angle of reflection. Since this
          mirror isn<rsq/>t flat the angles of incidence and reflection are measured
          from the line tangent to the parabola at the point where the light
          strikes the mirror. Thus the angle of incidence of a beam emerging
          from <m>F</m> and striking the parabola at <m>P</m> will be <m>\alpha</m> in our
          diagram and the angle of reflection will be <m>\beta (=\alpha)</m>. It
          follows that a light beam emerging from <m>F</m> and reflecting from the
          parabola at any point will follow a path parallel to the axis of
          symmetry of the parabola after reflecting from the interior of the
          parabola.
        </p>
        <image source="DC/Roberval7.png" width="25%"/>

        <p>
          You can see this in action with your car headlights or a
          flashlight. The reflector is cast in the shape of a parabola and the
          light emitting filament is placed at the focus, so all of the light
          which strikes the reflector gets reflected in that direction.
        </p>
        

        
        <p>
          Now turn this around. Any light beam coming parallel to axis of
          symmetry and striking the parabolic mirror will pass through the focal
          point <m>F</m>. The light is thus focused and the image appears larger.
          This fact was used by Isaac Newton in the seventeenth century to
          design a new, and better, telescope than the one used by Galileo a
          generation earlier. Galileo<rsq/>s telescope was based on the refraction of
          light as it passes through shaped lenses.  Through his study of optics
          Newton learned that the magnification effect could also be achieved
          via reflection.  It was his invention of the reflecting telescope that
          first brought Newton into scientific prominence.
        </p>
        <image source="DC/Satellite1.png" width="50%"/>
        <p>
          Newton used the reflective property of parabolas to design
          his telescope and it is still the fundamental optical
          principle that is used today to design all reflective
          telescopes, large and small.
        </p>
        <p>
          In fact, you use this every day. Since radio waves are a form of
          electromagnetic radiation, just like visible light, this is also a
          fundamental design point for both radar antennas, satellite cable TV
          dishes, and the antennas at the tops of cell phone towers.

        <title>The Tangent to an Ellipse</title>
        
        <p>
          Geometrically, an ellipse is the set of points in a plane,
          where the sum of the distances from two fixed points (foci)
          is a constant. Following Roberval we can generate an ellipse
          by combining two motions: one away from one focus
          (<m>F_1P</m>) and one toward the other focus (<m>PF_2</m>)
          as in the sketch below.
        </p>

        <image source="DC/Ellipse.png" width="50%"/>

        <p>
          If we set <m>d_1</m> equal to the length of <m>F_1P</m> and
          <m>d_2</m> equal to the length of <m>PF_2</m>, then
          <m>d_1+d_2</m> is constant.
        </p>
        <p>
          Because <m>d_1+d_2</m> is constant it should be clear that the rate at
          which <m>d_1</m> lengthens is related to the rate at which <m>d_2</m> shortens.
          These rates of change are represented by the red arrows in our sketch.

          From <xref ref="PROBLEMEllipseRhombus">Problem</xref> we see that any light ray,
          sound wave, etc., emanating from one focus of an ellipse will reflect
          off of the interior of the ellipse to the other focus.

          A playful example of the reflective properties of an ellipse are
          the so-called <q>whisper galleries.</q> If you and a friend
          stand at the foci of a room in the shape of an ellipse you will
          be able to converse in whispers even if you are very far
          apart. This is because the sound waves from your friend<rsq/>s voice
          will spread out to the walls and then reflect back to the other
          focus, where you are standing. Naturally, the volume of sound
          from any single location in the interior of the ellipse will
          have dropped considerably in transit. However, since all of them
          travel the same distance to get to you they arrive at the same
          time and the volume you hear is the sum of all of the individual
          reflected volumes.

          and the young man at the column at the right in the

          quietly, but no one else in the corridor can hear them..

          There is another whisper gallery in Statuary Hall in the Capitol
          building in Washington DC. This room was originally the meeting hall
          for the House of Representatives. It is said that when John Quincy
          Adams was a representative he would eavesdrop on his political enemies
          by placing himself at one focus of the room whenever he saw them
          talking quietly at the other.

          it works by generating shock waves at one focus of a reflecting
          ellipse. The reflective property of the ellipse then
          concentrate the waves at the other focus. Placing the stone,
          which is inside the patient<rsq/>s body, at the second focus allows

          The hyperbola also has interesting reflective properties. If a beam of
          light is aimed at one focus it will reflect off of the hyperbola
          toward the other focus. This property can be used to further refine
          the design of reflecting telescopes and antennae. The figure below shows the design of Cassegrain antenna.

<p>
The large, primary
          mirror on the left is parabolic and shares a focus with the smaller,
          secondary, hyperbolic mirror on the right. Light reflecting off of the
          primary mirror is directed at the shared focus on the right where it
          is reflected to the other focus at the primary mirror. A detection
          device is then placed at the secondary focus to collect the amplified
          signal.

          Roberval<rsq/>s use of arrows to represent velocities provides an intuitive
          way to understand the reflective properties of the conic

          gives us a dynamical way of looking at curves. This was a viewpoint
          that Newton adopted in his version of the Calculus.

    <title>Snell<rsq/>s Law and the Limitations of Adequality: </title>

    <p>
      When light passes from one medium to another, say from air to
      water, it bends. This property is called refraction.  The physical
      law governing refraction is known as Snell<rsq/>s Law, named after the
      Dutch Astronomer <url
      href="https://mathshistory.st-andrews.ac.uk/Biographies/Snell/"
      visual="https://mathshistory.st-andrews.ac.uk/Biographies/Snell/">Willebrord
      Snell</url> (1580<ndash/>1626) though it was accurately described
      before that time.  In modern terms, Snell<rsq/>s Law can be stated as
      follows.
    </p>

    <theorem xml:id="SnellsLaw">
      <title>Snell<rsq/>s Law of Refraction</title>
      <idx><h>Theorem</h><h>Snell<rsq/>s Law of Refraction</h></idx>
      <p>
        Suppose that
        light travels with a velocity of <m>v_1</m> in the first medium and
        velocity <m>v_2</m> in second medium, and that <m>\theta_1</m> and
        <m>\theta_2</m> are as seen in the diagram below.
      </p>
      <image source="DC/Refraction2.png" width="50%" />
      <p>
        Then the path that light follows satisfies
        <me>
          \frac{\sin(\theta_1)}{v_1} = \frac{\sin(\theta_2)}{v_2 }.
          </me> Notice that if <m>v_1=v_2</m> this says that
          <m>\sin(\theta_1)=\sin(\theta_2)</m> and the path of the line
          would be a straight line.
      </p>
    </theorem>

    <p>
      A number of mathematicians, including both Snell and Fermat,
      gave derivations of Snell<rsq/>s Law, but we will focus on Fermat<rsq/>s
      method.  To attack this problem, Fermat refined the <em>Nature
      is Lazy</em> assumption a bit. Instead of assuming that that
      light would follow the shortest path, he assumed that light
      would follow the path that takes the least time.
    </p>

    <p>
      Notice that this is consistent with our observations concerning
      reflections from a mirror.  In that case, the speed of light was
      constant so the shortest path was, in fact, the fastest
      path. But refraction occurs because the velocity of light
      changes when the surrounding medium changes.
    </p>

    <p>
      Let<rsq/>s see what happens when we try to use Fermat<rsq/>s Method of
      Adequality to find this fastest path.
    </p>


    <exercise xml:id="PROBLEMFermatSnell">
      <statement>

          Assuming that the velocity of light is <m>v_1</m> in the
          first medium and <m>v_2</m> in the second, use the following
          diagram to show the time, <m>t</m>, for light to travel

      <p>
        Is it clear to you that we<rsq/>ve used velocity in <xref
        ref="PROBLEMFermatSnell"></xref> when we really mean speed?
        If not, think about it for a moment. We<rsq/>re really only
        interested in how fast light travels in either medium, not in the
        direction it is going. This was the language used in the
        seventeenth century so it is accurate historically, but not
        mathematically.  Unfortunately, it is still common to use
        these words interchangeably, even among folks who know
        better. This can be quite confusing for the beginner but there
        isn<rsq/>t much that can be done except be aware of the
        problem. Whenever you encounter either word pause of a moment,
        and ask yourself if the speaker or author means velocity,
        which includes the direction of travel, or speed, which does
        not. It should always be clear from the context.
      </p>
    </aside>

    <p>
      Of course the next step would be to use Fermat<rsq/>s Method of
      Adequality to minimize <m>t</m>, but the square roots involved
      make the Algebra daunting to say the least. Despite these
      difficulties Fermat was able to show that <m>t</m> is minimized
      precisely when Snell<rsq/>s Law holds.
    </p>
    <p>

      Although it is possible to derive Snell<rsq/>s Law with the tools we
      now have it is very difficult so we won<rsq/>t attempt it
      here. Instead we will return to this problem in <xref
      ref="CHAPTERwhat-deriv-tells">Chapter</xref> where we will complete
      the derivation of Snell<rsq/>s Law using the rules of Calculus. That
      will be much simpler.

      It seems that our efforts to solve optimization problems using
      pre-Calculus techniques has hit an impasse. To be sure those
      techniques, and others of a similar nature, were very clever
      and it must be admitted that they yielded interesting and
      correct results. However for the most part they were
      <foreign>ad hoc</foreign> methods and quite limited in their
      applicability. We need a way to overcome these limitations.
    </p>

    <p>
      This is exactly what the invention of Calculus in the
      mid-seventeenth century did. The title of Leibniz<rsq/> first
      published work on Calculus makes this very clear:
