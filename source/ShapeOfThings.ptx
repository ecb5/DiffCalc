        Mankind invented a system to cope with the fact that we
        are so intrinsically lousy at manipulating numbers. It<rsq/>s called a

      In an age when everyone can open their cell phone and graph, for example, the function
      <men  xml:id="EQUATIONHolyGrail">
        
        y(x) =x^4 - 400.5 x^3 + 40099.49 x^2 + 4.005 x - 400.995,
      </men>
      literally in seconds it may not seem important to understand the
      nature of functions at any deeper level. After all, if you have a
      formula you know everything there is to know about a function, right?
    </p>
    <p>

      Well, yes  . . . and no.
    </p>


    <p>

      In a sense, obtaining a formula that describes whatever real-world
      phenomena you might be investigating is the
      <url href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holy_Grail" visual="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holy_Grail">Holy Grail</url>, of
      science. And for exactly the reason you would expect.  Formulas can
      tell us a great deal about the phenomenon. But they don<rsq/>t tell us
      everything.
    </p>
    <p>

      For example, suppose <xref ref="EQUATIONHolyGrail">equation</xref>)
      describes some real world phenomenon. Does reading the formula give
      you any sense of the essential qualities of <m>y(x)</m>? No, of course
      not.  Because pictures are easier to understand than formulas we
      usually look at the graph of a function to get a sense of it. We used
      one of the many graphing systems available to generate the graph of
      <m>y(x)</m> seen in <xref ref="FIGUREUnusableGraph"></xref>
      below. Impressive, isn<rsq/>t it?
    </p>
    <figure xml:id="FIGUREUnusableGraph">
      <caption>
        A useless graph of <m>y(x) =x^4 - 400.5 x^3 + 40099.49 x^2 + 4.005 x - 400.995</m>
      </caption>
      <image source="DC/HolyGrail1.png" width="50%"/>
    </figure>

    <p>
      Because we simply  used the default settings of our
      graphing tool this picture  doesn<rsq/>t really help much
      either. We<rsq/>ll have to modify the viewing window to see anything
      useful. Take out your favorite graphing utility and adjust the
      settings until you find  settings that give you a more useful display
      like the one in <xref ref="FIGUREUsaableGraph"></xref> below.
    </p>

    <figure xml:id="FIGUREUsaableGraph">
      <caption>
        A more useful graph of <m>y(x) =x^4 - 400.5 x^3 + 40099.49 x^2 + 4.005 x - 400.995</m>
      </caption>
      <image source="DC/HolyGrail3.png" width="50%"/>
    </figure>

    <p>

      To be sure, this graph does tell us great deal about the
      qualitative behavior of <m>y(x)</m>.  Visualizing the graph in this
      way is a good thing. But getting more detailed information can be
      tricky. For example, what are the exact values of the <m>x</m> coordinates
      of the two places where the graph appears to graze the <m>x</m> axis? One
      appears to be <m>x=0</m> and the other appears to be <m>x=200</m>, but is that
      right? Notice the horizontal and vertical scales. Can we be sure that
      at these scales all of the important bumps an wiggles on the graph are
      visible? When the top of the graph is at <m>y=</m> ten million can we tell,
      just by looking, if <m>y(0)=y(200)=0</m>?
    </p>
    <p>

      You might well ask, <q>Obviously when <m>x=0</m> and <m>x=200</m> <m>y</m> is near
      zero. Is it really important to know whether or not it is exactly
      zero?</q>
    </p>


    <exercise xml:id="DRILLHolyGrail1">
      <statement>
        <p>
          Compute <m>y(0)</m> and <m>y(200)</m> to see if they are really near
          zero.

      The fact is that it is hard to get good quantitative information from
      anything but very simple graphs.  But does that matter? From the graph
      above we can see very plainly what is happening over a very large
      interval. Isn<rsq/>t that enough?
    </p>
    <p>

      Well, that  depends.
    </p>
    <p>

      Suppose you are a nuclear engineer and you<rsq/>ve invented a simple
      process that requires an external source of energy. Suppose further
      that the graph above shows the rate of energy consumption, <m>y</m>, of
      your process as a function of the ambient temperature, <m>x</m>. Then
      any temperature at which <m>y\lt 0</m> is a temperature where the process is
      producing energy, not consuming it. Depending on rate of
      production and how simple the process is, being able to identify the
      temperature range where <m>y(x)\lt 0</m> could be the difference between
      winning the <url href="https://www.nobelprize.org/" visual="https://www.nobelprize.org/">Nobel Prize</url>, and
      becoming a laughing stock.

      In <xref ref="CHAPTERwhat-deriv-tells">Chapter</xref> we saw that the
      First and Second Derivative Tests are exactly the tools necessary to
      answer each of the following questions:
      <ol>
        <li>
          <p>
            On what intervals is the function increasing and on what  intervals is it decreasing?
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Where are the local extrema located?
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            What are the values of the local extrema?
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Where does the inflection of the graph transition between   concave up and concave down?
          </p>
        </li>
      </ol>
    </p>

    <example>
      <p>
        For example consider the following function.  <m>y=\frac{x}{1+x^2}</m>.
        Differentiating <m>y</m> we see that
        <me>
          \dfdx{y}{x}= \frac{(1+x^2)-2x^2}{(1+x^2)^2} =
        \frac{1-x^2}{(1+x^2)^2}.</me>
        
        This tells us that <m>y(x)</m> will have POTPs at <m>x=1,</m> and <m>x=-1.</m>
        Testing a single point in each of the intervals between POTPs we see
        that
        <me>
          \dfdxat{y}{x}{-2} =  \frac{-3}{25},\ \ \ 
          \dfdxat{y}{x}{0} =   1,
          \text{  and }
          \dfdxat{y}{x}{2} =  \frac{-3}{25},
        </me>
        and conclude that the graph is decreasing on the interval
        <m>\left(-\infty,-1\right)</m>, increasing on the interval <m>(-1,1)</m>, and
        decreasing again on <m>\left(-2,-\infty\right)</m>.
        
        
        Computing the second derivative gives:
        <me>
          \dfdxn{y}{x}{2}= \frac{-2x(3-x^2)}{(1+x^2)^3}.
        </me>
        This tells us that  <m>y(x)</m> will have PITPs at
        <m>x=-\sqrt{3}</m>, <m>x=0</m>, and <m>x= \sqrt{3}</m>.
        Testing a single point in each of these intervals between PITPs we
        see that
        <me>
          \eval{\dfdxn{y}{x}{2}}{x}{-2} \lt0,\ \ \ 
          \eval{\dfdxn{y}{x}{2}}{x}{-1}  \gt0,\ \ \ 
          \eval{\dfdxn{y}{x}{2}}{x}{1} \lt0,\ \ \ 
          \text{  and }
          \eval{\dfdxn{y}{x}{2}}{x}{2} \gt0,
        </me>
        and conclude that the graph is concave downward on the interval
        <m>\left(-\infty,-\sqrt{3}\right)</m>, concave upward on the interval
        <m>(-\sqrt{3},0)</m>, concave downward on the interval
        <m>\left(0,-\sqrt{3}\right)</m>, and concave downward on the interval
        <m>\left(\sqrt{3}, \infty\right)</m>.

    <exercise>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Use your favorite graphing tool to graph <m>y=\frac{x}{1+x^2}</m> and
          confirm our conclusions.

      <p>
        
        The previous example was
        fairly simple so it was easy to keep all of the important
        information in mind at the same time. This will not always be the
        case so we will need ways to organize the data we collect. This will
        ensure that it is not overwhelming.  Below we demonstrate one way to
        do this. It is not the only way.
        
        Let<rsq/>s sketch the graph of <me>y=\frac{2+2x^2+2x^4}{1+x^4}</me> using
        Calculus.   To use the First Derivative Test
        we<rsq/>ll need  the derivative     <m>
        \dfdx{y}{x} =y^\prime(x)= \frac{4x(1-x^4)}{(1+x^4)^2}
        </m>.
      </p>

      <p>
        Setting the first derivative equal to zero and solving we see that
        we have a POTP at <m>x=-1</m>, <m>x=0</m>, and at <m>x=1</m>.  To make all of this
        easier to see we arrange this data in the following table.  Notice
        that we have organized our POTPs (and hence the intervals that we
        are testing) from left to right, just as they would appear on a
        number line.
      </p>

      </table>


      <p>
        From the table above we see that we have a local maximum
        at <m>x=-1</m> and <m>x=1</m> and a local minimum at
        <m>x=0</m>. Based on this information we could reasonably infer that
        the graph might might have the shape shown below.
      </p> 

      <image source="DC/GraphingWith11.png" width="50%"/>

      <p> 
        The next step is to locate this graph on the <m>x</m>-<m>y</m>
        plane. From our table above we see that the local minimum is at
        <m>y(0)=2</m>, and the two local maxima are at <m>y(-1)=y(1)=3</m>.

        Thus we can, again reasonably, infer that the graph of <m>y(x)</m> is
        located on the plane as shown below.
      </p>
      <image source="DC/GraphingWith12.png" width="40%"/>

      <p>
        Unfortunately, we don<rsq/>t know that our graph is correct (in
        fact, it is not) because we<rsq/>ve
        made assumptions regarding its concavity that we haven<rsq/>t
        justified. This is the same error we made in the discussion
        following <xref ref="EXAMPLEMaxTriangle"></xref>, back in
        <xref ref="CHAPTERproblem-solving"></xref> when we drew a right triangle
        because it <q>seemed to be</q> correct. It is very easy to make this
        sort of mistake. Be careful.

        We can analyze the concavity of the graph using the second
        derivative in a manner very similar to what we did earlier with
        first derivative.

      Next we  set up a table to analyze the concavity of

      Combining the data in this table with the data in our previous table
      it would seem reasonable to infer that the graph of our function looks

      Does this graph above seem complete to you now?  Obviously it is not,
      or we would not have asked, but do you see what is missing?  What
      happens to <m>y(x)</m> as <m>x</m> is very far from zero either the positive or
      the negative direction? Does <m>y(x)</m> continue to drop? Or does it

      We<rsq/>re not quite ready to talk about this yet, so give it some thought

    <title>Graphing Without Formulas</title>

    <p>
      At it<rsq/>s most fundamental a function is just a rule for
      associating a given input with its unique output. For example, we
      could specify a particular function by writing <q>take two copies of the
      input, multiply them together and return the result as output.</q>  This
      is a complete and valid description but it is cumbersome to use.  This
      is why we<rsq/>ve  invented notation that allows us to write
      the description succinctly as the formula <m>f(x)=x^2</m>. It is easy
      to sketch an accurate graph of a function that is given as a formula,
      especially using modern technology, because the formula tells you the
      steps for finding the output for any given input.
    </p>
    <p>

      As mentioned earlier, formulas are the Holy Grail of modern science
      and business.  But, despite what you have seen in your mathematics
      education so far, very often we don<rsq/>t have such a formula. This is the
      usual situation. If you own a trout fishery business for example, you
      would love to have a formula that tells you how many trout your
      fishery will have on any given day of the year. With such a formula
      you could make plans for your business well into the future.  We will
      talk about this in more detail in the next section.
    </p>

    <example  xml:id="EXAMPLEGraphWOFormula">
      <p>
        For example, suppose we have the following information about a
        certain function.  Can we sketch a reasonable graph of the function?
        <ul cols="3">
          <li> <m>y(1)=2 </m></li>
          <li>       <m>\dfdxat{y}{x}{1}=0</m></li>
          <li>                 <m>\dfdxat{y}{x}{5}=0</m></li>
          <li>     <m>\eval{\dfdxn{y}{x}{2}}{x=3}{}=0</m></li>
          <li>     <m>\eval{\dfdxn{y}{x}{2}}{x=5}{}=0</m></li>
          <li> <p>    <m>\dfdx{y}{x}\gt0</m></p>
          <p>      for all <m>x\lt1</m></p>
          </li>
          <li>          <p> <m> \dfdx{y}{x}\lt0</m></p>
          <p>      for <m>1\lt x\lt 5</m></p>
          <p> and <m>x\gt5</m></p>
          </li>
          <li><p>     <m>\dfdxn{y}{x}{2}\gt0</m></p>
          <p>      for <m>3\lt x\lt5</m></p>
          </li>
          <li> <p>    <m>\dfdxn{y}{x}{2}\lt0</m></p>
          <p>      for <m>x\lt3</m></p>
          <p>      and <m>x\gt5</m></p>
          </li>
        </ul>
        
        In a sense this is easier than the previous problems, since intervals
        of increase, decrease, concave up, and concave down have already been
        determined for us.  For example, here are the tables for each.

        <m>y</m> is increasing or <m>y</m> is decreasing is just a
        matter of determining where the derivative is positive (above
        the <m>x</m> axis) or negative (below the <m>x</m>
        axis). Similarly the concavity of the graph of <m>y(x)</m> can
        be determined by finding where <m>\dfdx{y}{x}</m> is
        increasing (concave upward) and decreasing (concave
        downward). Equivalently, we find where <m>\dfdxn{y}{x}{2} </m>
        is positive and where it is negative. Given the graph of
        <m>\dfdx{y}{x}</m> above, we can produce the following
        tables.

      <example>
        <p>
          Consider the IVP,
          <md>
            <mrow>  \dfdx{y}{t}=t(4-t), \amp{}\amp{}         y(0)=0.</mrow>
          </md>
          In Integral Calculus (probably your next math course) you will learn
          how to find <m>y(t)</m> explicitly. For now we will be satisfied
          with sketching an approximate graph of <m>y(t)</m>.

          Setting <m>\dfdx{y}{t}=0</m> and solving we see that <m>t=0</m> and
          <m>t=4</m> are the POTPs for <m>y(t)</m>.  Thus on each of the
          intervals <m>(-\infty,0)</m>, <m>(0,4)</m>, and <m>(4,\infty)</m>
          the graph of <m>y(t)</m> is either always increasing or always
          decreasing. We tabulate this information as follows:

        <p>

          Based on this table, we can see that
          <m>y(0)=0</m> is a local minimum and <m>y(4)</m> is a local
          maximum. Observe that we do not know the value of <m>y(4)</m>, only
          that it must be a local maximum. Nor do we have any way to determine
          the value of <m>y(4)</m> in this problem.
        </p>
        <p>
          We  proceed in a similar fashion to determine concavity. The second
          derivative is
          <me>
            \dfdxn{y}{t}{2}=\dfdx{(t(4-t))}{t}=4-2t.
          </me>
          Setting <m>\dfdxn{y}{t}{2}=0</m> and solving, we see that <m>t=2</m> is a PITP
          for <m>y(t)</m>.  Making a table as before we have

        <p>

          Based on the table we see that the point <m>(2,y(2))</m> is an inflection point.
          
          We want to make a reasonable sketch of the graph of <m>y=y(t)</m> based
          on this information. But there is a lot of information in <xref ref="TABLEIVPPOTP1"></xref> and <xref ref="TABLEIVPPITP1"></xref>
          and our graph needs to be consistent with all of it.  So we first
          organize all of our conclusions by plotting the transition points
          (both optimal and inflective) on the <m>t</m> axis and identifying the
          intervals where <m>y</m> is increasing, decreasing,
          concave up, or concave down.

        <image source="DC/IncDecChart1.png" width="100%" />


        
        <p>

          This information, along with the initial value, <m>y(0)=0</m>
          allows us to provide a reasonable graph of <m>y(t)</m>.

        <p>
          From the initial condition in the IVP we know that <m>y(0)=0</m> but
          we have no information about the vertical coordinate of any other
          point on the graph. Thus, from the information given the scale of
          this graph is unknowable. But we know that the graph above is
          reasonable because it is consistent with the data given in the
          IVP. This sort of graphical, qualitative analysis is the best we can
          do with the information we have but, as you see, we can glean a
          great deal of information about the <q>shape</q> of the graph of a
          function from its derivative alone.

      <p>

        Consider the IVP
        <mdn>
          
          <mrow  xml:id="EQUATIONExpIVP2">  \dfdx{y}{t}=y,\amp{}\amp{} y(0)=1.</mrow>
        </mdn>
        This is the same IVP we approximated in
        <xref ref="SECTIONEulersMethod"></xref>. The analysis we will do here is
        related so you may find it useful to review that section before
        proceeding.
      </p>
      <p>


        As we<rsq/>ve seen every IVP has two parts: a differential equation (in
        this case, <m>\dfdx{y}{t}=y</m>, and an
        initial value (in this case, <m>y(0)=1</m> or equivalently, <m>(0,1)</m>).
      </p>

      <p>
        We will focus on the differential equation first.  The differential
        equation <m>\dfdx{y}{t}=y</m> says that at each point on the graph
        of <m>y(t)</m> the slope of the graph is equal to the vertical
        coordinate at that point.  For example if <m>(0,1)</m> is a point on
        the graph of <m>y(t)</m>, then nearby the graph of <m>y(t)</m> will
        look like the orange part of the sketch below.  On the other
        hand, if <m>(1,1)</m> is a point on the graph of <m>y(t)</m> then
        near the point <m>(1,1)</m>, graph of <m>y(t)</m> will look like the
        red graph in the sketch below.
      </p>
      <image source="DC/DEGraph2.png" width="30%"/>

      <p>

        In fact, for any value of <m>t</m>, we know that if <m>(t,1)</m> is a point on
        the graph of <m>y(t)</m> then the slope of the graph which passes through
        that point will be parallel to the orange and red lines above (that
        is, if a solution of the differential equation passes through a point
        <m>(t,1)</m> then its slope will be equal to <m>1</m> at <m>(t,1)</m>).
      </p>

      <p>

        This is seen in the figure below where each black dot represents a
        point with vertical coordinate equal to <m>1</m> and each orange segment
        represents the graph of the curve that both satisfies the differential
        equation from <xref ref="EQUATIONExpIVP2">IVP</xref>, and
        passes through that point. 
      </p>
      <image source="DC/DEGraph5.png" width="90%"/>

      
      <p>
        Similarly, if we know that <m>(t,2)</m> is a point on the graph of <m>y(t)</m>,
        where <m>y(t)</m> both solves the differential equation from
        <xref ref="EQUATIONExpIVP2">IVP</xref> and passes through that point, then the slope
        at <m>(t,2)</m> will be <m>2</m>, as seen in the following sketch.

        A sketch like this is called a <term>slope field</term>. The short
        line segment at each point, <m>(a,b)</m>, is a short section of the
        graph of the function which satisfies the differential equation
        <m>\dfdx{y}{t}=y</m>.
      </p>
      <p>
        If we know where
        to start (i.e., if we have an initial condition) the slope field
        allows us to determine the shape of the entire graph.
      </p>

      <p>
        For example to  sketch the graph of <m>y(t)</m> if it passes through the
        point <m>(2,3)</m>,
        we simply follow the line segments in our slope field starting at that
        point. This is the black graph in the sketch below. The graph of the
        <m>y(t)</m> that passes through the point <m>(5,5)</m> is shown in red below,
        and the graph that passes through the point <m>(-1,-1.25)</m> is shown in
        blue.

        To sketch the graph of the solution of a given  IVP  begin by
        drawing  the <term>slope field</term> for the differential equation. Then
        plot the  value and follow the slope field to sketch the graph.

              It is simplest to begin by sketching slopes at integer coordinate
              points and then to fill in between them to get a clearer sense of
              the graphs.}

      <title>When  <m>\dfdx{y}{t}</m> Depends on <m>y</m> and <m>t</m></title>

      <p>
        So far we<rsq/>ve examined the situation when <m>\dfdx{y}{t}</m> depends on <m>t</m>
        alone: <me>\dfdx{y}{t}=f(t)</me> and when <m>\dfdx{y}{t}</m> depends on <m>y</m> alone:
        <me>\dfdx{y}{t}=f(y)</me>. But, of course, it could happen at <m>\dfdx{y}{t}</m>
        depends on both <m>y</m> and <m>t</m>:<me>\dfdx{y}{t}=f(t,y)</me>. Analytically, this
        is a more complex situation. However it is possible, and quite useful,
        to get a qualitative sketch of the solution of an IVP from the slope
        field.
