    <p>
      As we observed in <xref ref="SECsome-rules-diff">Chapter</xref> Newton, Leibniz,
      and their contemporaries extended the Principle of Local Linearity to
      its logical limit. They said if you cut out an infinitely small
      section of a curve then the section actually is an infinitely short
      straight line segment. Of course we are quite familiar with infinitely
      short line segments. We call them differentials.

      Leibniz called a triangle whose sides are differentials, like the blue
      triangle in the figure at the right, a <term>differential triangle</term>

      In the figure <m>\dx{y}</m> and <m>\dx{x}</m> are differentials in
      the vertical and horizontal directions, respectively. But
      <m>\dx{s}</m> is a differential at the point <m>(a, a^2)</m> in the
      direction of the curve or, what comes to the same thing, in the
      direction tangent to the curve. Thus <m>\dx{s}</m> is a differential
      along the curve, and simultaneously along the line tangent to the
      curve
    </p>

    <aside>
      <title>Comment</title>

      <p>
        The idea that <m>\dx{s}</m>
        is a
        straight line segment on the curve and also on its tangent
        line is a bit  troubling. It is one of many bizarre consequences
        of  the notion of differentials.

      Notice that from the Pythagorean Theorem we have
      <me>

        \label{eq:PythTheorDiff}
        (\dx{s})^2=(\dx{x})^2+(\dx{y})^2.

    <p>
      The differentials <m>\dx{x}</m>, and <m>\dx{y}</m>, don't really tell us much
      about the graph of <m>y=x^2</m>, but the <term>differential ratio</term>,
      <m>\dfdx{y}{x}</m>, does. At each point, <m>(a, a^2)</m>, <m>\dfdx{y}{x}</m> gives us
      the slope of <m>\d{s}</m> and the line tangent to the curve at that point.
      Loosely speaking, the differential ratio <m>\dfdx{y}{x}</m> gives the slope
      of the curve at each point.
    </p>
    <p>
      If we want to find the slope of the curve <m>y=x^2</m> at the point
      <m>(a,a^2)</m> we simply find <m>\d{y}</m>  as usual:<m> \dx{y}=2x\dx{x}</m>.  Then
      we take the extra step of dividing through by <m>\dx{x}</m> to get
      <m>\dfdx{y}{x}=2x</m>.  Evaluating this at the point <m>x=a</m>, <m>y=a^2</m>, and
      <m>\dfdx{y}{x}=2a</m> which will give us
      the slope of the line tangent to the graph of <m>y=x^2</m> at the point
      <m>(a,a^2)</m>.

    <!-- \begin{Digression}[Evaluation Notation] -->
    <!--   We will frequently need to evaluate the expression <m>\dfdx{y}{x}</m> at -->
    <!--   different points. This can quickly become very confusing unless we -->

    <!--   be in play. In that case we write  -->

    <!--   evaluating <m>\dfdx{y}{x}</m> at the point <m>x=a</m>. -->
    <!-- \end{Digression} -->

    <example xml:id="EXAMPLEEvaluationNotation">
      <introduction> 
        <p>   For example to compute the slope of the graph of <m>y=3x^2-5x</m> at
        <m>(3,12)</m> we use the following three-step process.
        </p>
      </introduction> 
      <!-- \begin{enumerate} -->
      <task>
        <statement>
          <p>
            First  differentiate <m>y=3x^2-5x</m> to obtain the
            differential equation <m>\dx{y}=(6x-5)\dx{x}</m>. This
            relates <m>\dx{y}</m> and <m>\dx{x}</m>.
          </p>
        </statement>
      </task>
      <task>
        <statement>
          <p>
            Second, from this differential equation we
            find the ratio  <m>\dfdx{y}{x}=6x-5.</m> This
            differential ratio tells us the slope of the curve at
            every point on the curve.
          </p>
        </statement>
      </task>
      <task>
        <statement>
          <p>
            Third, if we need the value of <m>\dfdx{y}{x}</m> at a single
            point like <m>(3,12)</m>, for example
            we compute
            <me>\eval{\dfdx{y}{x}}{(x,y)}{(3,12)}=\bigeval{6
            x-5}{(x,y)}{(3,12)}=6\cdot3-5=13.</me>

          </p>
          <aside>
            <title>Mathematical Notation</title>

            <p>
              Obviously this makes no
              sense if the point <m>(3,12)</m> is not a point on the curve. You
              should always make sure the problem makes sense before you
              try to solve it.
            </p>
          </aside>
          <p>

            In this case we
            could just write: <m>\eval{\dfdx{y}{x}}{x}{3}=13</m>, since the <m>y</m>
            coordinate never comes into play.

          </p>
          <p>

            Finally, we emphasize that Leibniz' notation is
            <em>deliberately</em> evocative of the notion of slope because when
            we evaluate the differential ratio at a point it tells us the
            slope of the curve at that point.  In view of the <alert>Principle
            of Local Linearity</alert>, this is equivalent to finding the slope of
            the line tangent to the curve at that point.

    </example>
    <p>

      This notation probably seems unnecessarily cumbersome and honestly, in
      some ways it is. But be assured we have not made this choice
      lightly, and this notation has certain advantages that will become
      apparent later.
    </p>
    <p>

      It can be easy to get careless or simply confused and write <m>\dfdx{y}{x}</m>
      when you mean <m>\eval{\dfdx{y}{x}}{x}{a}</m>, and <foreign>vice versa</foreign>,
      so it is important that you have the distinction between them clear
      in your mind.

      There is real temptation at this point to cut corners and compute the
      differential ratio
      <m>\dfdx{y}{x}</m> all in one step. On purely practical grounds, we urge you to
      differentiate first and then divide by <m>\dx{x}</m> in two separate
      steps. Our reasons are two-fold.  First, the rules we've learned are
      <em>differentiation</em> rules. They were designed to compute
      differentials, not differential ratios.  Second, in applications
      to come we will see that dividing by <m>\dx{x}</m> will not always move the
      solution process forward. It can sometimes even get in the way,
      depending on the problem.
    </p>
    <p>

      Nonetheless, as you gain more experience and a deeper understanding
      you will find yourself gravitating toward the differential ratio more
      and more. This is a normal progression. As we have said before
      differentials are an intermediate step, a convenient fiction. You
      don't want to become tied to them for life.

    <title>Defining the Tangent Line</title>


    <image source="images/TangentLineDef6.png" width="50%"/>


    <p>
      The word tangent comes from the Latin word <foreign>tangere</foreign> (to
      touch).  So you'd think it would be easy to define what we mean by
      <q>tangent line.</q> When asked, most people will come up with something
      like, <q>The line tangent to a curve is the line that touches the curve
      at exactly one point.</q> Does this seem like a reasonable definition to
      you? Stop and think about it for a few minutes. We're obviously
      offering a plausible sounding definition that we know won't work. Do
      you see the problem?
    </p>

    <p>
      It certainly <em>seems</em> OK, and if we check it with a few simple
      examples everything looks reasonable.
      But consider a small segment of the graph of <m>y=x^3</m>
      at the point <m>(1,1)</m> and its corresponding tangent line as seen at
      the left.
    </p>
    <image source="images/TangentLineDef7.png" width="50%"/>
    <p>

      While this certainly fits our notion of a tangent line touching a
      curve only once, look what happens if we zoom out (see the sketch at
      the right).  This supposed tangent line will cross (touch) the
      graph of the curve a second time.  In fact, there is only one point on
      the graph of <m>y=x^3</m> where the tangent line touches the graph only
      once. Do you see which point that is?  Give this a few minutes
      thought.
    </p>
    <p>

      In view of what we've just seen, what do you think the definition of a
      tangent line
      <em>ought</em> to be?
    </p>
    <p>

      In the figure at the right it is clear that the <q>touching</q> is
      different at the two points. At <m>(1,1)</m> the blue tangent line
      <q>grazes</q> the graph of <m>y=x^3</m> at <m>(1,1)</m> exactly as we would
      expect. But at the other point it actually cuts through the graph.
    </p>
    <p>

      The difficulty seems to be that we said <q>touch</q> when we meant
      <q>graze</q>.  How about this definition instead: <q>The line tangent to a
      curve is the line that <em>grazes</em> the curve at exactly one point.</q>
    </p>
    <p>

      If it is not possible for a line to <q>graze</q> a curve at more than one
      point this could be a workable definition. Unfortunately the next
      drill shows that this is not true.
    </p>


    <exercise>
      <statement>
        <image source="images/TangentLineDef4.png" width="50%"/>
        <p>
          Show that <m> y=\frac12x+\frac14</m> is the equation of the
          line tangent to the graph of
          <me>
            y=\frac12x+\frac14 + (x-1)^2(x-2)^2(x-3)^2(x-4)^2.
          </me>
          at   <m>x=1, 2, 3, </m> and <m>x=4</m>  as seen in the
          sketch above.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </exercise>


    <image source="images/DifferentialTriangle3.png" width="50%"/>

    <p>

      It appears that clearly defining what we mean by <q>tangent line</q> is
      not as simple as it seemed to be at first. This is frustrating because
      we all have a pretty clear intuitive idea of what we mean. The difficulty seems to be capturing in
      words the mental image we all share.
    </p>
    <p>


      Recall that we have informally stated   the <term>Principle of Local
      Linearity</term> as: <q>Locally any curve is indistinguishable from a straight line.</q>
    </p>
    <p>

      But which straight line?
    </p>
    <p>

      The answer to that question is visible in the differential triangle at
      the left. It is clear that, <em>locally</em> (near a given point <m>(x,y)</m>
      on the curve) a curve will look like the hypotenuse of the
      differential triangle <m>\d{s}</m> at the point <m>(x,y)</m>.  So we make the
      following definition.
    </p>


    <definition xml:id="DEFINITIONdef:TangentLine">
      <title>The Line Tangent to a Curve  at a Point</title>
      <statement>
        <p>
          <!-- \label{def:TangentLine} -->
          The <term>line tangent to a curve</term>, at the point
          <m>(a,b)</m> is the line which passes through the point <m>(a,b)</m>
          with slope <m>m=\eval{\dfdx{y}{x}}{(x,y)}{(a,b)}</m>.

        </p>
      </statement>
    </definition>
    <p>

      Do you  see what we did here? Intuitively we know what properties we want a
      tangent line to have. We want it to <q>touch</q> or <q>graze</q> our
      curve at a particular point but we've seen that neither of those words
      quite captures everything we need. And what we need is for the tangent
      line to pass through the tangent point and have the same slope as the
      function at that point. So we've removed the words <q>touch</q> and
      <q>graze</q> in favor of the more precise, quantifiable language of Calculus.
    </p>
    <p>


      Since we <em>defined</em> the tangent line to be the extension of
      <m>\dx{s}</m> to the finite scale we have essentially defined it to have
      exactly that property we will need to make Differential Calculus
      useful.  Moreover with this definition in place the <term>Principle of
      Local Linearity</term> can be formalized a bit more.
    </p>

    <definition xml:id="DEFINITIONdef:LocalLinearity">
      <title>The Principle of Local Linearity</title>
      <statement>
        <p>
          <!-- \label{def:LocalLinearity} -->
          Sufficiently close to a given point every smooth curve is
          indistinguishable from the line tangent at that point.

        </p>
      </statement>
    </definition>
    <p>

      The history of mathematics is riddled with this sort of backward
      looking definition and we will see it again. For example Newton and
      Leibniz both knew what they wanted their <foreign>Calculus
      Differentialus</foreign> (Leibniz) and <em>Method of Fluxions</em> (Newton) to
      do. They worked out their computational procedures intuitively -- just
      as we started with an intuitive understanding of <q>tangent line.</q> But
      coming up with precise definitions and a solid logical foundation was
      harder. It took about <m>200</m> years for the mathematical community to
      devise definitions that gave back what intuition had led us to. This
      is part of why we are not yet overly concerned about our inability to
      precisely define a differential. When we finally address this issue in
      <xref ref="CHAPTwhats-wrong-with">Chapter</xref> we will not be devising any new
      differentiation techniques. We will be providing logical underpinnings
      for the techniques our intuition has led us to and that our experience
      has shown to be useful.

          Show that the only point on the graph of <m>y=x^3</m> where the tangent
          line touches the curve <em>only</em> at the point of tangency is the
          point <m>(0, 0)</m> and that the tangent is horizontal.

          Now graph the curve and the line tangent at <m>(0,0)</m> on the same
          set of axes. Does this <em>look</em> like a tangent line to you?
        </p>
      </statement>
    </problem>

    <p>
      
      Does the graph help you see the significance of
      <xref ref="PROBLEMtanlinedef">Problem~\</xref>? The line tangent to the graph of
      <m>y=x^3</m> at the point <m>(0,0)</m> actually crosses the graph at that
      point.  This is weird. And it is exactly counter to our original
      understanding of what it means for a line to be tangent to a curve
      isn't it?
    </p>
    <p>

      The next problem will probably strike you as equally weird. But in
      both problems the weirdness is a logical consequence of our definition
      of tangent line, so we will accept it as long as it doesn't lead to
      inconsistencies.
    </p>
    <p>

      Weirdness is acceptable. It is inconsistency that we need to avoid.

    <!-- Solving this gives <m>x=\pm1</m>. It is plainly -->

    <!-- when <m>x=-1</m>. -->
    <!-- But notice that there is no point on the graph where <m>x=1</m>!  -->
    <!-- Obviously it is meaningless to ask for the slope of a curve at a point that -->
    <!-- isn't on the curve. -->

    <!-- Even if we didn't have the graph to look at we could still tell that -->
    <!-- at <m>x=1</m> there is no tangent line.  Setting <m>x=1</m> and trying to solve for -->
    <!-- the corresponding <m>y</m> values we get <m>y^2=1-3+1=-1</m>. Since there is no -->
    <!-- real number that satisfies the equation <m>y^2=-1</m> we conclude that -->
    <!-- there is no point on the graph with <m>x</m>-coordinate equal to <m>1</m>. -->

    <!-- On the other hand, there are three values of <m>x</m> that correspond to -->
    <!-- <m>y=0</m>.  These would be difficult to compute but from the graph we can -->
    <!-- see that the tangent line is most likely vertical at all three points. -->
    <!-- To compute <m>\dfdx{y}{x}=\frac{3x^2-3}{2y}</m> at each of these points -->
    <!-- we would have to divide by <m>y=0</m>. -->

    <!-- Obviously when we divide a number by -->
    <!-- zero we get infinity, and just as obviously the slope of a vertical -->
    <!-- line is also infinity so everything fits. Right? -->
    <!-- No, of course not. This is just a very deceptive coincidence. -->

    <!-- Many -->
    <!-- students come into a Calculus with the impression that -->
    <!-- dividing by zero results in either zero or infinity. -->
    <!--   It does not. Division by zero is not meaningful. -->

    <!--   Mathematicians say that division by zero is an <term>undefined -->
    <!--     operation</term> or simply that it is <term>undefined</term>. At first it is -->
    <!--   not at all clear why this is, so let's take look at this -->
    <!--   question. -->

    <!--   What does it mean to divide by any number? To take a very concrete -->
    <!--   example, what does it mean to divide a length of five -->
    <!--   units -->

    <!-- <aside> -->
    <!-- <p> -->
    <!-- The units could be inches, picometers, or -->
    <!--     light-years. We don't care. -->
    <!-- </p> -->
    <!-- </aside> -->

    <!-- by seventeen? It means we want to -->
    <!--   divide the length into seventeen equally sized pieces, right?  But -->
    <!--   if we want to divided <m>5</m> units by zero, obviously we can't divide -->
    <!--   five into zero pieces. So in this very concrete example the phrase -->
    <!--   <q>five divided by zero</q> is simply and utterly without meaning. -->

    <!--   From a slightly more abstract viewpoint we could ask for the length -->
    <!--   of each piece when we divide a length of five into seventeen pieces. -->
    <!--   We get <m>\frac{5}{17}</m> of course. That's what the fraction notation -->
    <!--   means -->

    <!-- <aside> -->
    <!-- <p> -->
    <!-- Just as  <m>\frac12</m> is the number we get when we -->
    <!--   divide one into two pieces. -->
    <!-- </p> -->
    <!-- </aside> -->

    <!--  But what number do we get when we divide -->
    <!--   five into zero pieces. Once again the idea has no meaning. -->

    <!--   Taking an even more abstract point of view,  observe that multiplication and division are inverse -->
    <!--   operations (they undo each other). Twelve divided by three is four -->
    <!--   <m>\left(\frac{12}{3}=4\right)</m> precisely because when we -->
    <!--   multiply three times four we get twelve (<m>3\times 4 =12</m>). -->

    <!--   Now don't think of five as a length to be divided, think of it -->
    <!--   instead as simply a number. So what number can we multiply -->
    <!--   by zero to get five? Obviously there isn't any such number so this -->
    <!--   is a meaningless question. -->

    <!--   No matter what we try or how we look at it we cannot find any -->
    <!--   way to make  division by zero meaningful. -->
    

    <!--         \end{Digression} -->
    <p>

      Since we can't divide by zero we will need to be a bit more careful
      about how we interpret the symbol <m>\dfdx{y}{x}</m>. It will give us the
      slope of the curve (equivalently, the slope of the tangent line) as
      long as <m>\dfdx{y}{x}</m> has meaning. But when <m>y</m> is zero
      <m>\dfdx{y}{x}=\frac{3x^2-3}{2y}</m> is meaningless.  Thus it appears that
      for this particular curve we can draw no conclusions whatsoever from
      our formula about the tangent line when <m>y=0</m>. In this case we say
      that the differential quotient is <term>undefined</term>. In general, the
      differential quotient is <term>undefined</term> at any point where
      evaluating <m>\dfdx{y}{x}</m> requires a division by zero.
    </p>
    <p>

      Does this mean we can draw no conclusions at all? Certainly not. In
      fact those values of <m>x</m> or <m>y</m> where <m>\dfdx{y}{x}</m> is undefined will
      often turn out to be the most useful. But we are not yet quite prepared to
      see how to deal with them properly so we will defer this discussion
      until a later point.
    </p>
    <p>

      At the very least this warns us that there are subtleties that must be
      dealt with when using a powerful tool like Calculus. We will avoid
      these subtleties for a bit longer, but you need to know that they
      exist. Don't try to force matters by, for example, blindly dividing by
      zero as if it is meaningful. We will return to these matters when we
      have a better understanding of the underlying principles.

    <p>

      These last three problems illustrate that while many otherwise
      difficult computations can be done <q>in these lines, as if by magic</q> (to
      quote Leibniz) there are still a great many subtleties to be
      accounted for. There is still plenty of room for creative, analytical
      problem solving.
    </p>
    <p>

      We will come back to some of these subtleties later. For now keep in
      mind that while Calculus is a very powerful tool it does not allow us
      to solve all problems blindly, by simply moving the pebbles.

      To acclimate astronaut train\-ees to the effects of weightlessness,
      NASA uses the following training regimen: It has an airplane perform a
      series of steep climbs and sharp dives.  At the top of
      each climb passengers will experience weightlessness for about <m>25</m>
      seconds.  During a training flight the pilot will repeat this maneuver
      about <m>40</m>
      times.

      It is well known that the path of an object moving only under the
      influence of the Earth's gravity
      at the surface of the earth is parabolic. To simulate
      weightlessness
      inside the plane the Vomit Comet is flown so that its flight path
      matches such a parabolic flight. That is, its shape will be the graph
      of a curve having the form
      <me>
        y=Ax^2+Bx+C.

      We'd like to find the values of the unknown parameters <m>A</m>, <m>B</m>, and
      <m>C</m> that match the path of an object moving under the influence of
      Earth's gravity.  Once these are known we will also be able to
      determine the peak altitude of the flight and how far (horizontally)
      it will go before coming back to the altitude where the maneuver
      began. That is, we can find the point where the pilot should pull out of the
      dive. Finally we'd like to confirm the claim that this maneuver takes
      about <m>25</m> seconds.

      Ultimately to find <m>A</m>, we'll need to have a better model of the motion.
      Fortunately, Calculus is exactly the right tool for building such a
      model but we don't yet have all of the pieces we need.  We will

      The pilot of a Vomit Comet seeks to simulate weightlessness, but the
      pilot of a commercial airliner works hard to avoid subjecting
      its passengers to extreme effects like weightlessness or, at the other
      end, of extreme gravity so it must descend more gradually.  This
      situation is a little easier to understand so we will explore it in
      the next couple of problems and examples before returning to the Vomit
      Comet.

      <!-- \label{example:FlightPath} -->
      <p>
        We want to model the flight path of a plane as it lands and
        determine the distance from the runway the plane should be when it
        starts its descent.

        A fundamental tenet of mathematically modeling real world phenomena
        is to keep things as simple as possible. So, the first thing we'd be
        likely to try for is a parabolic descent path:
        <me>y=Ax^2+Bx+C.</me>
        But it is pretty clear that this won't work because the
        plane should be traveling horizontally at the beginning and at the end
        of its descent. At the end, because at that point it should be on
        the ground, and at the beginning because we don't want to terrify
        the passengers.

  We've taken our analysis of the flight paths of both the Vomit Comet
  and our airliner as far as we can using slopes alone. The problem is
  that a flight path is like a road. A road doesn't go anywhere. It just
  sits there. But an object traveling along a road (or a flight path) is
  moving. It has a velocity and an acceleration.
</p>
<p>

  Analyzing a static path does not allow us to model either the velocity
  or the acceleration of an object moving along that path. Fortunately
  for us, Newton's formulation of Calculus is just what we need to do
  attack these problems.
</p>
<p>

  But since the Vomit Comet aims to replicate the path of a body falling
  freely under the influence of gravity  we will also
  need to consider the influence of  gravity.

    In the previous section we asserted -- with no justification

    parabolic. Then, in <xref ref="PROBLEMFlightPath2">Problem</xref>, we gave you the
    task of finding the constants <m>B</m>, and <m>C</m> for which the graph of
    the curve <me>y=Ax^2+Bx+C</me> is the flight path of the Vomit Comet with

    Inside the airplane, we want what is called <term>neutral buoyancy</term>.
    This means that we don't want any forces pushing us up or down, side
    to side, or back and forth relative to the
    airplane
  </p>
  <aside  xml:id="ASIDENeutralBuoyancy">
    <title>Comment</title>

    <p>
      Naturally, if the plane and everything in it are
      falling towards the earth then the force of gravity is in play. But
      if everything falls together there is no force inside
      (relative to) the plane.
    </p>
  </aside>
  <p>
    The way to assure this is to force the 
    airplane to fly along the same path it would take if it were unpowered
    and falling freely.  At first it might seem like all we have to do is
    shut down the engine, but that won't work because air resistance will
    prevent the plane from falling freely.  The engines must be
    engaged to force the plane along the path it would follow naturally if
    there were no atmosphere
    and thus, no
    resistive forces.  In this section we'll see why this path must be
    in the shape of a parabola.

    Newton very famously said, <q>If I have been able to see further, it is
    by standing on the shoulders of giants,</q>
    and, in his <m>1684</m> paper on Calculus, Leibniz remarked that <q>Other
    very learned men have sought in many devious ways what someone versed
    in this calculus can accomplish in these lines as by magic.</q>
  </p>
  <p>

    As we've seen Fermat, Descartes, and Roberval were three of the
    learned giants Newton and Leibniz were indebted to.  Another was
    Professor Galilei (1564-1642) of the University of Pisa, who is
    universally known and referred to by his first name,
    <url href="https://mathshistory.st-andrews.ac.uk/Biographies/Galileo/" visual="https://mathshistory.st-andrews.ac.uk/Biographies/Galileo/">Galileo</url>. As
    a professor of mathematics at Pisa, Galileo studied, among other
    things, how objects moved under the influence of gravity.
  </p>
  <p>
    We will be following Galileo's lead to address such questions as:
    <ol>
      <li>
        <p>
          Suppose you throw a ball straight up into the air. How high will     the ball go?
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          How long will it take for it to hit the ground and  what will its velocity be at impact?
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          If you throw the ball up  twice as hard. Will it go twice as high?
        </p>
      </li>
    </ol>

    Since Galileo had neither the technology nor the mathematics to
    account for air resistance he ignored it.  For the moment we will ignore
    it too.

  <p>

    The accepted theory of motion in Galileo's time
    was <url href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aristotle" visual="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aristotle">Aristotle</url>'s
    assertion that a heavier object would fall faster than a lighter
    object. Our common experience is that a hammer falls faster than a
    feather so this was an entirely reasonable thing to believe at the
    time. But we now know that this is because the resistance of the air
    slows the feather more than it does the hammer.
  </p>
  <p>

    In <m>1971</m>, Apollo Astronaut David Scott confirmed this
    experimentally (see the video at the right) by dropping both a
    hammer and a feather on the surface of the moon. Because there is no
    air on the surface of the moon there is no air resistance, so the
    hammer and feather hit the surface of the moon at the same time.
  </p>
  <p>

    Since he didn't have access to the moon Galileo had to be clever
    instead.  But Galileo was one of the group of new scientists who
    gathered experimental data and applied mathematical principles to
    theories. As a result of his experimental investigations Galileo
    proposed that in the absence of air all objects would fall at the
    same rate
  </p>

  <aside  xml:id="ASIDEGalileoExcom">
    <title>Historical Note</title>

    <p>
      Galileo could be quite argumentative and this
      eventually got him into hot water with the Vatican. In the last
      years of his long life he was threatened with excommunication and
      and risked execution for espousing

    How did he surmise that all objects would fall at the same rate?
  </p>
  <p>

    Well actually, he didn't.  We need to be very careful in our use of
    language here. To say that <q>all objects fall at the same rate</q> is a
    bit sloppy. Since velocity is the rate of change of position it seems
    to say that all objects fall at the same velocity.
  </p>
  <p>

    But we know that's not true because the velocity of a falling object
    depends on how long it has been falling. At the moment  you drop a ball its
    velocity is zero. Thereafter it gains
    velocity -- it accelerates. Thus an object that has just been
    dropped is moving slowly while an object that has been falling for a
    while is moving at a faster rate.
  </p>
  <p> 


    What Galileo actually proposed was that the rate of change of 
    the velocity -- the <term>acceleration</term> -- of all falling bodies is 
    constant. But an object falling freely under the influence of Earth's gravity 
    gets moving pretty quickly and in Galileo's day the tools available 
    for measurement were very limited. So he slowed things down by letting 
    small balls roll down a ramp as shown below.

    Galileo assumed (correctly) that friction with
    the ramp would not significantly influence his measurements. When he
    did this he noticed that the balls always seemed to accelerate at a
    constant rate which depended only on the steepness of the ramp. More
    precisely, the acceleration of the rolling ball varied with the angle
    of descent. In modern terms we would say that the acceleration is a
    function of the angle of descent.

    Referring to the diagram above, it is clear that when
    <m>\theta=\pi/2</m> -->
    the ball won't move at all. So its acceleration is zero. When
    <m>\theta=0</m> the ball accelerates downward freely under the influence of
    gravity with no resistance
    Galileo
    measured the acceleration associated with steeper and steeper ramps
    (that is for <m>\theta</m> closer and closer to zero) obtaining a table of
    values similar to the one at the left.

  <aside>
    <p>
      Notice
      that we are using radians to measure the angle. If you are unsure
      what a radian is we have a brief review of Trigonometry in
      <xref ref="SECTIONsubsec:trig-interl"></xref>.
    </p>
  </aside>

  <p> 
    For scientific computation radian measure is usually simplest, so we
    will use fairly consistently throughout this text. But degree

  <p>

    From the table it is clear that as <m>\theta</m> gets closer and closer to
    zero the acceleration is getting closer and closer to <m>9.8.</m> Thus
    Galileo  deduced that when there is no ramp (when
    <m>\theta =0</m>) the velocity will increase each second by
    <m>9.8\frac{\text{meters}}{\text{second}}.</m>
  </p>
  <p>

    That is, the velocity of an object falling under the influence
    of the earth's gravity increases by <m>9.8</m> meters per second, each
    second. This is usually abbreviated as <m>9.8\frac{\text{meters}}{\text{second}^2}</m>, is commonly
    denoted by <m>g</m>, and is called the <term>constant of acceleration due
    to gravity</term>
  </p>

  <exercise>
    <statement>
      <p>
        With a little Trigonometry you can deduce that
        <m>g=9.8\frac{\text{meters}}{\text{second}^2}</m>
        with only one measurement.  Use the diagram and the first line of the
        table above to deduce that <m>g=9.8.</m>
      </p>
    </statement>
    <hint>
      <p>
        <m>\cos\left(\pi/3\right)=1/2</m>.
      </p>
    </hint>
  </exercise>

  <p>

    If we drop the object from some height, then its initial velocity is
    zero.  After one second it will be falling at a rate of
    <m>9.8\frac{\text{meters}}{\text{second}}</m>, after two seconds, its velocity will be
    <m>9.8\times2=19.6\frac{\text{meters}}{\text{second}}</m>, etc.  That is, as an object falls, its
    velocity increases at the constant rate of
    <m>9.8 \frac{\text{meters}}{\text{second}}</m> every second: <m>v=9.8t.</m>
  </p>
  <p>

    The specific number that Galileo found,
    <m>9.8\frac{\text{meters}}{\text{second}^2}</m>, is an artifact of the units
    we use to measure distance (meters) and time (seconds) and the fact
    that we are on the surface of a particular planet.  If we measure
    distance in feet instead then at the surface of the earth a falling
    object will accelerate at <m>32 \frac{\text{feet}}{\text{second}^2}</m>. If
    we go to the surface of the moon, it will accelerate at <m>1.6
    \frac{\text{meters}}{\text{second}^2}</m>.
  </p>


  <exercise>
    <statement>
      <p>
        Show that if we measure distance in feet, the acceleration constant
        on the moon is approximately
        <m>5.2\frac{\text{feet}}{\text{second}^2}.</m>
      </p>
    </statement>
  </exercise>
  <p>  
    The general situation is this: If a falling object's velocity, in meters per second
    (<m>\frac{\text{meters}}{\text{second}}</m>), is changing at a constant rate of <m>r</m> meters per second per
    second (<m>\frac{\text{meters}}{\text{second}^2}</m>), and <m>t</m> is the number of elapsed seconds then
    <m> v=rt.</m> From Galileo's work we know that at the surface of the Earth
    <m>r=g=9.8</m> so
    <men  xml:id="EQUATIONVelocity">

      v=9.8t
      \label{eq:Velocity}

    </men>
  </p>

  <p>
    We can check that this is reasonable by looking at the units of
    measurement. Since the acceleration <m>r,</m> is measured in
    <m>\frac{\text{meters}}{\text{seconds}^2}</m> and time is measured in
    seconds, when they are multiplied a symbolic cancellation gives
    <me>
      \frac{\text{meters}}{\text{second}^2}\cdot \text{second} = \frac{\text{meters}}{\text{second}\cdot \cancel{\text{second}}}\cdot \cancel{\text{second}} = \frac{\text{meters}}{\text{second}}
    </me>
    or meters per second; the units used to measure velocity. Notice that
    <xref ref="EQVelocity">Equation</xref> is independent of the weight of the falling
    object. Under the influence of gravity alone all objects accelerate
    downward at the same rate.
  </p>


  <p>
    Galileo's hypothesis that all objects falling solely under the
    influence of Earth's gravity accelerate at the same rate came from
    both his experimental evidence and a famous thought experiment he
    described in his book <pubtitle>On Motion</pubtitle>~(1590).  The experiment
    runs as follows:

    Imagine that two objects, one light and one heavy,
    are connected to each other by a string and we drop them from  a great
    height, say the top
    of the Tower of Pisa.
    If we assume heavier objects do indeed fall
    faster than lighter ones the string will soon pull taut as the lighter
    object retards the fall of the heavier object.
  </p>
  <p>

    So, the system  taken as a whole will fall more slowly than the
    heavier object alone.
    But the system as a whole is heavier than either individual object.
    So, the system taken as a whole
    will fall faster than the heavier object.
  </p>
  <p>

    This contradiction leads inexorably to the conclusion that our initial
    assumption -- that heavier objects accelerate faster -- must be false.
  </p>
  <p>

    According to legend Galileo tested his hypothesis by dropping balls of
    different weights from the top of the Tower of Pisa, but that is
    almost certainly pure legend. He never actually did this.  Probably.
  </p>
  <p>

    Galileo set out his ideas about falling objects in his last book
    <foreign>Discorsi e Dimostrazioni Matematiche intorno à due nuoue
    Scienze</foreign> (Discourses and Mathematical Demonstrations Concerning Two
    New Sciences) (1638). This was the last of Galileo's many scientific
    works
  </p>

  <aside>
    <p>
      Toward the end of his life the Inquisition of the Catholic
      Church placed Galileo under house arrest in his home. His crime what
      that he had openly supported Copernicus's theory that the earth
      revolves around the sun. Rather than remain idle during his
      imprisonment he revisited his unpublished research from when he was
      younger and used that as a foundation for his final opus.
    </p>
  </aside>
  <p>

    The two
    sciences referred to in the title were the science of motion, which
    became the foundation of modern physics, and the science of materials
    and construction, an important contribution to engineering.
  </p>
  <p>

    Suppose an object falls <m>56</m> meters from the top of the Tower of Pisa to the
    ground. Can we determine how fast it is moving when it strikes the ground?
  </p>
  <p>

    Recall that the formula <m>v=gt</m> tells us the ball's velocity at any
    time <m>t</m>. So if <m>t_g</m> is the amount of time it takes for the ball to
    reach the ground then the velocity at the end would be <m>v=gt_g</m>. But
    how do we find out exactly when the ball strikes the ground?
  </p>
  <p>

    To see the difficulty, suppose we dropped the ball from
    a height of <m>9.8</m> meters.  Would it take <m>1</m> second for the ball to
    hit the ground?
  </p>
  <p>

    Clearly not.
  </p>
  <p>

    To reach the ground after <m>1</m> second the ball would have to
    average <m>9.8\frac{\text{meters}}{\text{second}}</m> during the entirety of that first second.
    But at first it is not moving at all (velocity <m>=0</m>). After one second
    its velocity has increased to <m>9.8 \frac{\text{meters}}{\text{second}}</m>. So for the entire duration of
    that first second the ball's velocity is less than <m>9.8
    \frac{\text{meters}}{\text{second}}</m>. Thus after <m>1</m> second it has not yet hit the ground because it
    was never going fast enough to do so.  Exactly how far it has fallen
    isn't clear.
</p>
<p>

  Reasoning similarly, at the beginning of the next second the ball is
  already falling at <m>9.8\frac{\text{meters}}{\text{second}}</m> and thereafter it's velocity increases,
  so it falls at least <m>9.8</m> meters during the next second, in addition
  to the distance it fell during the first. So, while we cannot yet tell
  exactly how far it falls during either second, we can say that,
  (1) it will not hit the ground during the first  second, and (2)  it
  definitely  will hit the ground sometime during
  the next second.
</p>
<p>


  If we had an expression for the ball's position, <m>p</m>, similar
  to <xref ref="EQVelocity">Equation~</xref>), we would be in much better shape.
  Galileo was able to determine the distance the ball fell without the
  tools of Calculus, but since learning to use those tools is why we're
  here, we will use them.

  Let <m>p(t)</m> represent the position at time <m>t</m> of a ball under the
influence of gravity. That is, <m>p(t)</m>
tells us how far the ball has moved from its starting position,
<m>p(0)</m>, after <m>t</m> seconds.  Our goal is to use Galileo's discovery
that <m>g=9.8\frac{m}{s^2}</m> to find a formula for <m>p(t)</m>.
</p>
<p>
  During an (infinitesimal) instant of time <m>\dx{t}</m>, the velocity is
  virtually constant so during that instant of time, <m>\dx{t}</m>, the
  infinitesimal change in position, <m>\dx{p}</m> is given by
<me>\dx{p}=\text{velocity }\times\text{ change in time} =v\dx{t}.</me>
But from <xref ref="EQVelocity">Equation~</xref>) we also know that <m>v=9.8t</m>, so
<m> \dx{p}=9.8t\dx{t}</m>.

  <introduction>
    <p>
      <!-- \label{problem:PositionVelocityAcceleration} -->
      Thus finding the position of the ball at any

<p>
  To summarize the results of
  <xref ref="PROBLEMPositionVelocityAcceleration">Problem~\</xref> we see that if
  <m>p = p(t)=\frac{g}{2}t^2</m> denotes the position of a dropped ball at
  time <m>t</m>, the following statements are true.
  <ol>
    <li>
      <p>
        The velocity of the ball is given by <m>v  =\dfdx{p}{t}(=gt)</m>,
</p>
</li>
<li>
  <p>
    The rate of change of the  velocity (acceleration)
    is then.
    <me>

      \label{eq:AccelerationAsSecondDerivative}
      \dfdx{v}{t}=\dfdx{\left(\dfdx{p}{t}\right)}{t}=g.

</me>
</p>
</li>
</ol>
</p>

<p>

  Notice that in our diagram we also introduced
  the variable <m>h</m> which represents the height of the ball from the
  ground. The way we choose to define our variables can have a
  considerable impact on the way we understand a given problem. Here
  for example both <m>p</m> and <m>h</m> give us the position of the ball but
  if <m>p(t)=4.9t^2</m>, then <m>p=0</m> represents the top of the tower and the
positive direction is down. Conversely, if  <m>h(t)=56-4.9t^2</m>, then <m>h=0</m>
represents ground level and the positive direction is up.
</p>
<p>

  Our examination of Galileo's work affords us the opportunity to
  broaden our understanding of the meaning and use of differentials
  and differential notation.  In
<xref ref="PROBLEMPositionVelocityAcceleration">Problem~\</xref> we used <m>p(t)</m>
to represent the distance that the ball has fallen at time <m>t</m>. In
that case it turned out that <m>\dfdx{p}{t}</m> represents the velocity
with which the ball is falling at time <m>t</m>. This is at once mundane
and profound.
</p>
<p>

  It is mundane because velocity has always been defined as distance
  (<m>\dx{p}</m>) divided by elapsed time (<m>\dx{t}</m>), and this remains true
  even when the distance and the time are infinitesimals.
</p>
<p>

  It is profound because the (instantaneous) velocity <m>v(t)</m>, of the
  ball is always some finite quantity, but we compute it using the
  quotient of two differentials, <m>\dfdx{p}{t}</m> in this case.
</p>
<p>

  This <term>differential ratio</term> is a fundamental concept.  In general
if some quantity, say <m>y</m> is changing in time then <m>\dfdx{y}{t}</m>
represents the (instantaneous) rate of change of <m>y</m>.
</p>
<p>  
  In <xref ref="PROBLEMPositionVelocityAcceleration">Problem~\</xref> we saw that
  the velocity of the falling ball is also changing in time, just like
  its position.  Thus we can turn around and compute the instantaneous
  change in velocity (the acceleration) by computing the differential
  of the velocity <m>\dx{\left(\dfdx{p}{t}\right)}</m>, and dividing by
  <m>\dx{t}</m>, giving <m>\dfdx{\left(\dfdx{p}{t}\right)}{t}</m>. This very
  awkward notation is often abbreviated as <m>\dfdxn{p}{t}{2}</m>. Notice
  that the acceleration is the result of the following set of
  computational steps:
  <ol>
    <li>
      <p>
        Differentiate <m>p</m>.
</p>
</li>
<li>
  <p>
    Divide by <m>\dx{t}</m>.
</p>
</li>
<li>
  <p>
    Differentiate <m>\dfdx{p}{t}</m>.
</p>
</li>
<li>
  <p>
    Divide by <m>\dx{t}</m> again.
</p>
</li>
</ol>
</p>
<p>    
  As you become more fluent with these computations you will
  inevitably begin to combine these steps. Your teacher probably
  already does. However, the computation of a differential ratio
always involves finding the differential of some <em>finite</em>
quantity and then dividing by another differential. If your
instructor computes a differential ratio and you don't see how it
was done, ask them to show you each differentiation and division.

If we read the  abbreviated notation <m>\dfdxn{p}{t}{2}</m> literally it seems to suggest that
<m>\dx^2p=\dx(\dx{p})</m> is meaningful but it is not. The notion of
taking the differential of a differential is fraught with logical
difficulties which we will address in
<xref ref="CHAPTwhats-wrong-with">Chapter</xref>. For now we can avoid pitfalls
by recognizing that the expression <m>\dfdxn{y}{x}{n}</m> is the result
of differentiating and dividing by <m>\dx{x}</m> <m>n</m> times. We will
explore this bit further in the next section.

  Differentials are helpful for learning and using the differentiation
  rules, but otherwise they are not very useful. Moreover as we have
  frequently pointed out, using differentials brings up certain logical
  and philosophical questions (Like, <q>What are they?</q>) that are
  very difficult to address. When we come
  back to these matters in
  <xref ref="CHAPTwhats-wrong-with">Chapter</xref> you'll see what we mean. For all
  of these reasons and more the concept of differentials should be
  regarded as a convenient fiction and nothing more.
</p>
<p>

  On the other hand as we've just seen the <em>ratio</em> of
  differentials, <m>\dfdx{y}{x}</m>, is extremely useful as it can be used to represent
  either the slope of a graph or the velocity of a moving object,
  depending on the context. Moreover the differential ratio is an
  ordinary real number.
</p>
<p>

  Because of concerns regarding the validity of differentials,
  mathematicians in the <m>18</m>th and <m>19</m>th centuries, had a strong
  motivation to skip over the differential concept and jump immediately
  to the more useful, and finite, differential ratio.
</p>
<p>

In his <m>1797</m>
work
<url href="https://www.maa.org/press/periodicals/convergence/mathematical-treasure-lagrange-on-calculus" visual="https://www.maa.org/press/periodicals/convergence/mathematical-treasure-lagrange-on-calculus">\foreign{Th\'{e</url>orie
des Fonctions Analytiques}} (<pubtitle>The Theory of Analytic
Functions</pubtitle>),
<url href="https://mathshistory.st-andrews.ac.uk/Biographies/Lagrange/" visual="https://mathshistory.st-andrews.ac.uk/Biographies/Lagrange/">Joseph
Louis Lagrange</url> (<m>1736-1813</m>) attempted to make Calculus more
rigorous.  He even coined a new term for the differential
ratio. He called it the <foreign>fonction d\'{e</foreign>riv\'{e}e} (meaning a
function <em>derived</em> from another function). He also replaced the
differential ratio <m>\dfdx{y}{x}</m> with the more modern
<term>function</term> notation <m>y^\prime(x)</m> (read <q><m>y</m> prime of <m>x</m></q>).
</p>
<p>

  Lagrange's attempt to make Calculus rigorous was very clever, but
  ultimately unsuccessful. Full rigor had to wait for another hundred
  years, so we will not say much about Lagrange's efforts here.  But we
  will adopt his terminology and his notation.

<!-- \begin{Digression}[Function Notation, and Prime Notation] -->
<!--   \label{digress:VarConFun2} -->
<!-- The French phrase <foreign>fonction d\'{e</foreign>riv\'{e}e} has come into -->
<!-- English as <q>derived function,</q> the <term>derivative function</term>, or -->
<!-- (most commonly)  just the <term>derivative</term>. -->

<!--   Suppose that <m>y=x^3</m>. It is clear that <m>y</m> depends on -->
<!--   <m>x</m>, so we denote this functional dependence with the notation -->
<!--   <me> -->
<!--   y(x)=x^3. -->
<!--   </me> -->

<!--   Lagrange called the differential ratio <m>\dfdx{y}{x}</m>, a -->
<!--   <term>derived function</term>. -->
<!--   The <q>derived</q> part seems clear enough. After all, if <m>y=x^3</m> -->
<!--   them <m>\dfdx{y}{x}</m> is obtained (derived) from <m>y</m> as -->
<!--   follows: -->
<!--   \begin{align*} -->
<!--     y\amp =x^3 -->
<!--     \dx{y}\amp =3x^2\dx{x} -->
<!--     \dfdx{y}{x}\amp =3x^2. -->
<!--   \end{align*} -->

<!--   Since  <m>\dfdx{y}{x}</m> depends on <m>3x^2</m> as a -->
<!--   function it would not be wrong  to denote this functional -->
<!--   dependence as  -->
<!--   <me> -->
<!--   \dfdx{y}{x}(x) = 3x^2 -->
<!--   </me> -->
<!--   but it would be awkward. Moreover, Lagrange was trying to get away -->
<!--   from the use of differentials so instead he used -->
<!--   <me> -->
<!--   y^\prime(x)=3x^2 -->
<!--   </me> -->
<!--   and called <m>y^\prime(x)</m> the  <term>derivative</term> (derived function) of <m>y(x)</m>. -->

<!-- In some contexts Lagrange's prime notation has several advantages over -->
<!-- the differential notation we've been using. Over time it has become -->
<!-- the most common notation for the <term>derivative</term> in mathematics. But the -->
<!-- fact that it took over <m>100</m> years to develop suggests that something -->
<!-- more than mere notation is in play here. -->

<!-- Our current task is to master the differentiation rules so we will -->
<!-- stick to Leibniz's differential notation as much as possible because -->
<!-- using multiple equivalent notations can be very confusing.  But there -->
<!-- will come a time when Lagrange's prime notation will be much more -->
<!-- convenient.  At that point we will casually use the two expressions -->
<!-- <m>\dfdx{y}{x}</m> and <m>y^\prime(x)</m> interchangeably and we will think of -->
<!-- them both as a function <em>derived from</em> the function <m>y(x)</m>. -->

<!-- When we do this the differential notation we're currently emphasizing -->
<!-- will take on two distinct <q>personalities.</q>  On the one hand -->
<!-- <m>\dfdx{y}{x}</m> represents a ratio of the differentials <m>\dx{y}</m>, and -->
<!-- <m>\dx{x}</m> which are distinct infinitesimal quantities. On the other hand -->
<!-- <m>\dfdx{y}{x}</m> is the name of a function -\- it is all one symbol. You -->
<!-- cannot detach the pieces of <m>\dfdx{y}{x}</m> any more than you can delete -->
<!-- the letter <q>n</q> from <m>\sin(x)</m> because si<m>(x)</m> has no meaning. -->

<!-- Eventually the differentials we've been using so casually will become -->
<!-- a guilty secret. Given <m>y=y(x)</m> we'll use them as a helpful aid while -->
<!-- we <em>compute</em>. But as soon as we have <m>\dfdx{y}{x}</m> in hand we -->
<!-- will view it as a single, complete symbol representing the (finite) -->
<!-- derivative function. Often we will simply replace it with -->
<!-- <m>y^\prime(x)</m> as if we are ashamed of having used differentials at -->
<!-- all. -->

<p>

  The bottom line is that we will adopt the name <term>derivative</term> to
  indicate the result of  dividing one differential by another. So the
  expression <m>\dfdx{y}{x}</m> is <q>the derivative of <m>y</m> with respect to
  <m>x</m>.</q>
</p>
<p>

  When computing a derivative you will eventually become sufficiently
  proficient that you will jump directly to the derivatives. But for
  now we urge you to go through the two-step process of
  differentiating to obtain a differential and then dividing by
  another differential to obtain a derivative because the
  computational rules you've learned are differentiation rules, not
  derivative rules.  If you do this, you will avoid some difficulties
  created by trying compute too much too soon. This can be illustrated
  in the following example, where we purposely use prime notation to
  highlight the difficulties involved in the computation.
</p>

<example xml:id="example:DerivVSDiff">

  <!-- \label{example:DerivVSDiff} -->
  <p> 
    Given <m>y(x)=(1+x^2)^\frac12</m> we wish to compute
    <m>y\prime(x)</m>. Setting <m>z=1+x^2</m> we see that
    <me>
      y(x)=z^\frac12.
</me> 
By the Power Rule we have
<me>
  <!-- \label{eq:PrimeVSDiff} -->
  y^\prime(x)=\frac12z^{-\frac12}.
</me>
This would seem to be correct but it is not. Do you see the
problem?
</p>
<p> 
  The left side of <xref ref="EQPrimeVSDiff">equation~</xref>) indicates that
  the variable is <m>x</m> but there is no <m>x</m> on the right side, only
  <m>z</m>. So this can't be right. But what went wrong?

  We can  avoid problems like this by using differentials:
  <me>

    \label{eq:PrimeVSDiff2}
    \dx{y}=\frac12z^{-\frac12}\dx{z}.
    
</me>
At this point if we divide by <m>\dx{z}</m> we recover
<xref ref="EQPrimeVSDiff">equation~</xref> in the form:
<me>
  \dfdx{y}{z}=\frac12z^{-\frac12}.
</me>
Thus we see  the left side of
<xref ref="EQPrimeVSDiff">equation~</xref>) should have been <m>y^\prime(z)</m>
not  <m>y^\prime(x)</m>.
</p>
</example>
<exercise>
  <statement>
    <p>
      Starting with <xref ref="EQPrimeVSDiff">equation~</xref>) complete the
      computation of <m>y^\prime(x)</m>.
    </p>
</statement>
</exercise>


<example>
  <p>
    Of course, using differentials does not address all of the
    difficulties.
    For example,
    let <m>y= x^3</m>. Then
    <me>
      \dx{y}= \dx{(x^3)}= 3x^2\dx{x}
      \left(\text{First Derivative:}\dfdx{y}{x}=3x^2\right)
</me>
So far, so good. Next we apply the Product Rule,

<me>
  \dx{(\dx{y})}= \dx(3x^2\dx{x}) = 3x^2\underbrace{\dx{(\dx{x})}}_{=0} +
  6x\dx{x}\dx{x}
</me>
so
<men  xml:id="EQUATIONPRNotation">
  \dx{(\dx{y})} =    6x\dx{x}\dx{x} \left(\text{Second Derivative: }\frac{\d(\d{y})}{\d{x}\d{x}}=6x=\dfdxn{y}{x}{2}.\right)
  \label{eq:PRNotation}
</men>
</p>

<aside>
  <p>
    To see why <m>\dx(\dx{x})=0</m> we need to know that Leibniz always
    considered the differential <m>\dx{x}</m> to be a constant. And the
    differential of any constant is zero, by the Constant Rule.
</p>
</aside>

<p>

  The glaring question here is why is <m>\dx(\dx{x})</m> equal to zero but
  <m>\dx(\dx{y})</m> is not equal to zero? Or, at a more fundamental level,
  what do we mean by <q>the infinitely small change of an infinitely
  small change?</q> As we will see in
  <xref ref="CHAPTwhats-wrong-with">Chapter</xref> the early critics of Calculus
  cited this question specifically to argue that Calculus was invalid.
</p>
<p>

  We will address these issues beginning in
  <xref ref="CHAPTwhats-wrong-with">Chapter</xref>. For now we will make the
  following compromise: We will only differentiate finite quantities,
  be they functions, or derivatives.  Since our ultimate goal is to
  compute some derivative
  this will suit our needs without getting
  caught up in the very problematic question of the nature of higher
  order differentials.  So for this example we have
  <md>
    <mrow>
      y\amp =x^3
</mrow>
<mrow>
  \dx{y}\amp =3x^2\dx{x}
</mrow>
<mrow>
  \text{ (First Derivative) }    \dfdx{y}{x}\amp =3x^2
</mrow>
<mrow>
  \dx\left(\dfdx{y}{x}\right)\amp =6x\dx{x}
</mrow>
<mrow>
  \text{(Second Derivative) }    \dfdxn{y}{x}{2}\amp =\dfdx{\left(\dfdx{y}{x}\right)}{x}=6x
</mrow>
<mrow>
  \text{(Third Derivative) }\dfdxn{y}{x}{3}\amp =\dfdx{\left(\dfdxn{y}{x}{2}\right)}{x}=6.
</mrow>
</md>

</p>
</example>


<example xml:id="example:HighOrderDerivs">
  <p>

    <!-- \label{example:HighOrderDerivs}  -->
    Consider the expression <m>y=\frac1x =x^{-1}</m>. Differentiating we have
    <md>
      <mrow>
        \dfdx{y}{x}\amp =(-1)x^{-2},
</mrow>
<mrow>
  \dfdxn{y}{x}{2} \amp = (-1)(-2)x^{-3},

</mrow> 
<mrow>      
  \dfdxn{y}{x}{4} \amp = (-1)(-2)(-3)(-4)x^{-5}
</mrow>
</md>

You've probably been taught all of your life to <q>simplify</q> complex
looking expressions like <m>(-1)(-2)(-3)(-4)</m> and  you
probably do it  without thinking. So you may be wondering why
we left the coefficients above in the form we did.
</p>
<p>

  The reason is simple. We were looking for patterns not numbers.
Writing the above formulas as <m>\dfdxn{y}{x}{2} = 2x^{-3},</m>
<m>\dfdxn{y}{x}{3} = -6x^{-4}</m>, and <m>\dfdxn{y}{x}{4} = 24x^{-5}</m>
obscures the pattern.
Keep this in mind as you proceed.  Algebraic or arithmetical
<q>simplifications</q> often  get in the way of recognizing patterns. Don't do them until
there is a compelling reason to.

  If <m>s(t)</m> represents the position of an object moving in a straight
  line we have seen that its velocity is given by <m>\dfdx{s}{t}</m>. When
  the object is falling vertically we will use <m>y(t)</m> to represent its
  vertical position, so that <m>\dfdx{y}{t}</m> is its vertical
velocity. Similarly if it is moving horizontally we will use <m>x(t)</m>
and <m>\dfdx{x}{t}</m>.
</p>


<image source="images/Helicopter3.png" width="50%"/>
<!-- <!-\- \begin{wrapfigure}[12]{r}{1.in} -\-> -->

<p>

  Recall that in
  <xref ref="PROBLEMHelicopterFall">Problem</xref> we imagined releasing an object from
  a helicopter which is flying horizontally horizontally
  with a speed of <m>\dfdx{x}{t}=1\frac{\text{meter}}{\text{second}}</m>.
  From Galileo's work we now know that its vertical velocity will be
  <m>\dfdx{y}{t}=9.8 t\, \frac{\text{meters}}{\text{second}}</m>.
</p>
<p>

  After its release the ball will fall neither horizontally, nor
  vertically. It won't even fall along a straight line. If we ignore air
  resistance then combination of the ball's horizontal velocity
  (inherited from the helicopter) and its vertical velocity (due to the
  force of gravity) will cause the flight path, <m>s(t)</m>, to curve into an
  arc similar to that shown in the figure at the right.
</p>

<exercise>
  <statement>
    <p>
      Since <m>\dfdx{x}{t}=1</m> we have <m>x=t</m>. Since  <m>\dfdx{y}{t}=-9.8t</m> and we know that <m>y=-4.9t^2.</m> Use this to find a formula
      for <m>y=y(x)</m> and confirm that the arc is a parabola.
</p>
</statement>
</exercise>
<p>
  <!-- As the ball falls there are three distinct quantities we are -->
  <!-- interested in: the horizontal velocity of the ball, <m>\dfdx{x}{t}</m>, the vertical -->
  <!-- velocity of the ball, <m>\dfdx{y}{t}</m>, and its speed in the direction of travel. -->

</p>
<p> 
  We'd like to find the <em>speed</em> of the object in the direction it
  is moving.  Referring to the differential triangle in our sketch it is
  clear that this will be
  <m>\abs{\dfdx{s}{t}}</m>.  But how do we
  find <m>\dfdx{s}{t}</m>?
</p>

<aside>
<title>Mathematical Notation</title>

<p>
  The absolute value bars here are
  correct.  This has more to do with our vocabulary (speed
  vs. velocity) than with this physical problem. In general speed is
  always a positive number, while velocity can be negative or
  positive. We will discuss this in more depth in
  <xref ref="CHAPTERcha:calc-trig">~</xref>
</p>
</aside>
<p>
  Since <m>\dx{x}</m> and <m>\dx{y}</m> are perpendicular (they are displacements
  in the horizontal and vertical directions, respectively)  by
  the Pythagorean Theorem  we have
  <me>
    (\dx{s})^2=(\dx{x})^2+(\dx{y})^2.
</me>
Thus the displacement of <m>s(t)</m>, in the direction of travel is
<me>
  \abs{\dx{s}}=\sqrt{(\dx{x})^2+(\dx{y})^2}.
</me>
Dividing by <m>\abs{\dx{t}}</m> we see that the speed in the direction of travel
at any time <m>t</m> is

<md>
  <mrow>
    \abs{\dfdx{s}{t}}\amp =\frac{\sqrt{(\dx{x})^2+(\dx{y})^2}}{\dx{t}}
</mrow>
<mrow>
  \amp =\sqrt{\left(\dfdx{x}{t}\right)^2+\left(\dfdx{y}{t}\right)^2}
</mrow>
<mrow>
  \amp = \sqrt{1+(9.8t)^2}.
</mrow>
</md>

<p>
Recall that we stopped analyzing in <xref ref="PROBLEMFlightPath1">Problem</xref>
because we needed  to be able to account for both the velocity and the
acceleration of the craft. We now have everything we need to finish
the analysis of the flight path of the commercial airliner which we

  Through experimentation Galileo had accurately described the motion of

  Kepler</url> (<m>1571-1630</m>) had accurately described the motion of the

  Brahe</url> (<m>1546-1601</m>).  But these two descriptions of motion did not
  appear to be related.
</p>

<p>  It was left to Newton to unify them, but the mathematics for this did
not exist at the time. So he invented Calculus, which he called
<pubtitle>\href{https://www.maa.org/press/periodicals/convergence/mathematical-treasure-newtons-method-of-fluxions</pubtitle>{The
Method of Fluxions}}.  Galileo studied motion on the surface of
the Earth.  Kepler studied the motion of the planets, but the
underlying theme for both was motion.

</p>
<p>
  For Newton everything was in motion.  When he used the variable <m>x</m> he
  thought of it as representing something <q>flowing in time</q>
  (moving). Such quantities he called <term>fluents</term>, from
  <foreign>fluere</foreign>, the Latin word which means <q>to flow.</q>  As he put
  it himself in his book
  <url href="https://www.maa.org/press/periodicals/convergence/mathematical-treasure-newton-on-quadrature-of-curves" visual="https://www.maa.org/press/periodicals/convergence/mathematical-treasure-newton-on-quadrature-of-curves">\foreign{Quadratura
  Curvarum</url>} (On the Quadrature of Curves),
  <em>    I sought a method of determining quantities from the velocities
  of the motions or [of the] increments, with which they are
  generated; and calling these velocities of the motions, or [of
  the] increments, \emph{fluxions</em>, and generated quantities
  <em>fluents</em>, I fell by degrees, in the years <m>1665</m> and
  <m>1666</m>, upon the method of fluxions, which I have made use of
  here in the quadrature of curves.}
</p>
<p>

  For a given fluent <m>x</m>, Newton used the <q>dotted letter,</q>
  <m>\dot{x}</m>, to refer to its <em>instantaneous velocity</em> or
  <term>fluxion</term>. Whereas for Leibniz the static differential was the
  fundamental concept, for Newton the dynamic fluxion (velocity) was
  fundamental.  On the surface fluxions seem quite different from
  differentials.
</p>
<p>

  In Newton's view the only independent variable is time. So all
  fluxions were velocities, or rates of change with respect to time. To
  see how fluxions are connected to the differential ratios we've been
  using,  we need only ask ourselves how Leibniz would express the
  fluxion, <m>\dot{x}</m>, of the fluent, <m>x</m>. In Leibniz' notation the rate
  of change of <m>x</m> <em>with respect to</em> <m>t</m> is the differential ratio
  <m>\dfdx{x}{t}</m>.  Since Newton <em>defines</em> <m>\dot{x}</m> to be the rate
  of change of <m>x</m> with respect to (<m>t</m>)ime (velocity),
  <me>
    \dot{x} = \dfdx{x}{t}.
</me>
</p>
<p>



From Newton's point of view differentiating the spatial coordinate <m>y</m>
with respect to the spatial coordinate <m>x</m> to get <m>\dfdx{y}{x}</m> is
simply not meaningful.  On the
other hand, if <m>P=(x,y)</m> is a point moving along some curve in the
plane then both <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> are fluents with corresponding fluxions
<m>\dot{y}</m> and <m>\dot{x}</m>.
</p>
<p>

  What Leibniz's notation expresses as
  <m>\dfdx{y}{x}</m> Newton's notation expresses as
  <m>\frac{\dot{y}}{\dot{x}}</m>. But they are the same thing.
  since
  <me>
    \frac{\dot{y}}{\dot{x}} = \frac{\dfdx{y}{t}}{\dfdx{x}{t}}=
    \frac{\dx{y}}{\cancel{\dx{t}}}\frac{\cancel{\dx{t}}}{\dx{x}}=\dfdx{y}{x}.
</me>
</p>
<p>

  
  Although the two formulations are equivalent Leibniz' notation has
  become dominant in mathematics. But  in fields where velocity is a
  fundamental concept, like physics and engineering, Newton's dot
  notation is often still used.
  For example, suppose we are considering a point <m>P</m> on the curve
  <m>y=x^2</m> and we want
  the slope of the curve at <m>P</m>.  Using our
  differentiation rules, we have
  <me>
    \dx{y}=2x\dx{x}.
</me>
To get the slope, we divide by <m>d{x}</m> to get
<me>
  \dfdx{y}{x}=2x.
</me>
</p>
<p>

Using his Method of Fluxions, Newton would have considered both <m>x</m>
and <m>y</m> to be fluents and <m>P=(x,y)</m> to be a point moving along a
curve.  His version of Calculus would have started with the same
governing equation <m>y=x^2</m> and determined that their fluxions were
related by the equation
<me>
  \dot{y}=2x\dot{x}.
</me>
</p>
<p>

  To get the slope of the curve <m>y=x^2</m>, we simply  need to recognize
  that this is the same as
<me>\frac{\dot{y}}{\dot{x}}=2x=\frac{\dfdx{y}{t}}{\dfdx{x}{t}}=\dfdx{y}{x}.</me>
</p>
<p>


  Although Newton's dot notation has fallen out of favor in
  mathematics you
  will likely see it being used in your physics or engineering courses
  (if you take any). We would be remiss if we failed to recognize this
  fact.
  So when appropriate, we will sometimes couch our problems in the
  dynamical language and dot notation of Newton. We will even
  sometimes refer to the derivatives <m>\dfdx{y}{t}</m>, or <m>\dfdx{x}{t}</m> as
fluxions. After all when  <m>t</m>
represents time that's what they are. Only the notation has changed.
</p>
<p>

  If you prefer the Leibnizian terms and notation it is easy to
  translate between Newton and Leibniz. If <m>x</m> is changing in time then
  <m>\dot{x}=\dfdx{x}{t}</m> is the fluxion of <m>x</m>.

      It is reasonable to assume that the rate at which the volume of a

    <!-- \label{sec:self-inters-curv} -->
    In <xref ref="PROBLEMClassicalCurves1">Problem~\</xref> we asked  you to find the line
    tangent to several interesting curves.  However, we were careful to ask
    only about relatively simple curves. In particular, none of the curves
    in <xref ref="PROBLEMClassicalCurves1">Problem~\</xref> intersected themselves. We
    avoided self-intersecting curves earlier because we didn't have the
    techniques necessary to address the problem of tangent lines at points
    where a curve crosses itself. We do now.

    But we need to broaden our thinking a bit.

<p>

  If we try to compute <m>\eval{\dfdx{y}{x}}{(x,y)}{(0,0)}</m> for the Folium
  of Descartes we find that
  <m>\eval{\dfdx{y}{x}}{(x,y)}{(0,0)}=\frac{0}{0}</m> which is very strange.
  We can see in the graph that at <m>(0,0)</m> there is both a horizontal
  and a vertical tangent line, so it seems to make some sort of
  sense.
</p>
<p>

  You might be thinking that we have stumbled upon a new rule about tangent
  lines: If we ever obtain <m>\dfdx{y}{x}=\frac{0}{0}</m>, at some point then
  the curve has both a vertical and horizontal tangent at that point.
  It would be nice if things were that simple, but they aren't.
</p>
<p>

  But now consider the Tschirnhausen Cubic at the self-intersection
  point <m>(-8,0)</m>.  As long as we stay away from the self-intersection
  point there are no difficulties. But from the graph we can see that
  any sort of tangent line at the point of self-intersection would be
  neither vertical nor horizontal despite the fact that once again we
have <me>\eval{\dfdx{y}{x}}{(x,y)}{(-8,0)}=\frac{0}{0}.</me>
</p>
<p>

  If nothing else, these examples illustrate that using Calculus is much
  more subtle than simply computing a derivative. A cavalier attitude
  can lead to some very strange anomalies.  As is true of any powerful
  tool, to avoid disaster we must be careful.
</p>
<p>

  The safest approach is to avoid points of self-intersection and
  fractions such as <m>\frac00</m>. But we won't be able to avoid them
  forever so we might as well address the issue now.  Adopting Newton's
  dynamic approach will give us the crucial insight.  Think of the
  horizontal and vertical coordinates as Newton's fluents; things
  changing in time.
</p>
<p>


  Using the static approach to find a tangent line at a
  self-intersection point is very much like standing in the center of
  the intersection of two roads and trying to decide if the road goes
  north-south or east-west. Obviously the road doesn't go anywhere. It
  just sits there. Likewise, a curve is not dynamic. It just sits there,
  like a road.
</p>
<p>

  It is the travelers on the road and the point that traces a curve
  which move.
</p>
<p>

  If instead we ask, <q>Which way are we going as we
  <em>pass through the intersection</em>?</q> there is only one answer. We're
  going in the direction we were traveling when we entered the
  intersection.  If we think about the situation dynamically rather than
  statically, we always have both a position on the curve and a
  direction we are traveling.
</p>
<p>

  So if we adopt Newton's viewpoint and think of the curve as being
  generated by the motion of a point things change.
</p>
<p>

  If we are traveling along a curve our direction of travel is always
  tangent to the curve. By changing our question from <q>What is the
  tangent line at this point?</q> to <q>What is the tangent line at this
  time?</q> the concept of two (or more) tangent lines at a single point
  in space becomes meaningful. Each tangent is obtained by passing
  through the point of tangency at distinct moments in time.

  What comes along with this change in interpretation is this: We no
  longer want to think of a differential ratio <em>only</em> as a
  slope.  If <m>y</m> and <m>x</m> happen to represent the vertical
  and horizontal coordinates of a graph, then the change of <m>y</m> with
  respect to <m>x</m>, <m>\dfdx{y}{x}</m>, will be the slope of the curve
  <m>y=y(x)</m>.
</p>
<p>

If <m>y</m> represents the vertical position of an object and <m>t</m>
represents the time when the object is at position <m>y(t)</m>, then the
change of <m>y</m> with respect to <m>t</m>, <m>\dfdx{y}{t}=\dot{y}</m>, is the
vertical velocity of the object as it passes through <m>y</m>.  Likewise,
if <m>x(t)</m> represents the horizontal position of an object then
<m>\dfdx{x}{t}=\dot{x}</m> is the horizontal velocity of the object as it
passes through <m>x</m>.
</p>
<p>

  In general, if <m>\alpha</m> and <m>\beta</m> are two related quantities  then
  <m>\dfdx{\alpha}{\beta}</m> is the <term>rate of change of <m>\alpha</m> with respect to
  <m>\beta</m>.</term> The physical (or geometric) interpretation of
  <m>\dfdx{\alpha}{\beta}</m> will necessarily depend on what <m>\alpha</m> and
  <m>\beta</m> represent physically (or geometrically).
</p>
</introduction>

<subsection xml:id="SUBSECTIONParametricFunctions">
<title>Parametric Functions</title>
<p>

  When we switched to Newton's dynamical viewpoint, we changed the nature of
  our representations of the curves. For example the Folium of Descartes
  can be represented by the formula as
<me>x^3+y^3=3xy.</me>
This formula is complex and can be hard to work with, mainly because
the relationship between <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> is difficult to see and understand.
</p>
<p>

  In the representation
  <me>
    x(t)=\frac{3t}{1+t^3}, \ \  \
    y(t)=\frac{3t^2}{1+t^3}
</me>
the relationship between <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> is still difficult but since
<m>x(t)</m> and <m>y(t)</m> are both functions the relationship between <m>x</m>
and <m>t</m> and between <m>y</m> and <m>t</m> is a bit simpler. We know how to
work with functions.
</p>
<p>

  This second representation is usually called the <term>parametric
  functions</term> or <term>parametric equation</term> representation, because the
  <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> coordinates are given in terms of a parameter. In this
  case the parameter <m>t</m> represents time. This is common but by no means
  required. The parameter might represent anything, just as any variable
  might.
</p>
<p>

  In fact, you might be wondering where we got the parameterization for
  the Folium.  It may not seem obvious, but as long as <m>(x,y)\neq(0,0)</m>, the
  parameter <m>t</m> actually represents the slope of the line joining the
  origin to the point <m>(x,y)</m> on the Folium.
</p>


<problem>
  <statement>
    <p>
      Let <m>(x,y)</m> represent any point on the Folium
      <m>x^3+y^3=3xy</m> which is not the origin.  Let <m>t</m> represent
      the slope of the line joining the origin to <m>(x,y)</m>; that is,
      <m>\frac{y}{x}=t</m> or <m>y=tx</m>.  Use this to show that
      <me>
        x=\frac{3t}{1+t^3},\text{ and } y=\frac{3t^2}{1+t^3}.
</me>
</p>


<p>
  The difference between this problem and
  <xref ref="PROBLEMproblem:FoliumOfDescartes1">~</xref> is this: In
  <xref ref="PROBLEMFoliumOfDescartes1">Problem</xref> we gave you <m>x(t)</m> and
  <m>y(t)</m> and asked you to show that it satisfies the equation of the
  Folium. Here we start with the equation of the Folium and you need
  to find <m>x(t)</m> and <m>y(t)</m>. 
</p>

</statement>

</problem>
<p>

  Of course, it is not wrong to also think of this parameter as time.
  We are just stipulating that the point is moving so that its
  position at time <m>t</m> is such that the slope of the line joining the
  origin to the point matches <m>t</m>.  Mathematically, what the parameter
  represents is usually not at issue. It is just a parameter.
</p>
<p>


  Recall that when we looked at Roberval's treatment of the conic
  sections in <xref ref="SECroberv-conic-sect">Section</xref> we found it handy
  to think of our curves as being traced out by the motion of a
  point and we created the notation
  <m>
    \begin{ParamEq}
    {x(t)}{y(t)}
    \end{ParamEq}
    </m> to reflect that point of view. With one slight modification this notation suits our current
    needs as well.
</p>
<p>

  First, since the coordinates of our point are, individually,
functions of <m>t</m> it follows that the position of the point <m>P</m>
itself depends on (is a function of) <m>t</m> as well:
<me>P(t)=
\begin{ParamEq}
{x(t)}{y(t)} .
\end{ParamEq}
</me>
</p>
<p>
  Second, it is useful for us to have a convenient way to specify
  the domain of the function. So we add a third component to do
  that. For example, if the domain of our function is all
  values of <m>t</m> strictly between zero and one we would write.
  <me>
    P(t)=
    \begin{ParamEq}
    {x(t)}{y(t)}{0\lt t\lt1}.
    \end{ParamEq}
</me>
</p>

<p>

  <q>Dynamic</q> and
  <q>static</q> are only words we use to describe the way we're thinking
  about a problem. There is nothing inherently dynamic or static in either representation
  so there is no <foreign>a priori</foreign> reason to prefer one over the
  other. They describe the same set of points in the plane.
</p>
<p>

  For example if <m>y=x^2</m> then <m>\dx{y}=2x\dx{x}</m>. Time (<m>t</m>) does not

  statically. However if we want to think of them dynamically we divide
  by <m>\dx{t}</m> to get <m>\dfdx{y}{t}=2x\dfdx{x}{t}</m> and interpret this to
  say that at any given time <m>t</m>, the position of a point is
  <m>
    \begin{ParamEq}
    {x(t)}
    {y(t)}
    \end{ParamEq}
    </m> and the vertical velocity, <m>\dfdx{y}{t}</m> is twice the
    value of the <m>x</m> coordinate times the horizontal velocity,
    <m>\dfdx{x}{t}</m>.

<example>
  <p>

    Moving between the equation and parametric forms can be very hard to
    do depending on the complexity of the equation.  The simplest
    situation is when you have <m>y</m> as a function of <m>x</m>; for example
    <m>y(x)=x^2</m>. To find a parametric representation we observe that we
    need to specify both <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> as functions of a third parameter,
    <m>t</m>. This can be puzzling until we realize that <m>x</m> is completely
    free. All we need to do is ensure that <m>y=x^2</m>.  So if we take
    <m>x(t)=t</m> and <m>y=x^2=t^2</m> we <em>almost</em> have our
    parameterization.
</p>
<p>

  When faced with a formula like <m>y=x^2</m> you have learned to always
  assume that <m>x</m> could be any real number that makes sense in the
  formula. But with parametric equations this assumption can lead to
  problems. We'll need to specify the allowable values of the
  parameter <m>t</m> explicitly. This is why we said we <em>almost</em> have
  our parameterization. A complete parameterization must specify the
  values of <m>t</m> that are available to us, so in this case
  <me> P(t)= \begin{ParamEq} { x(t)= t} { y(t)= t^2} {
  -\infty\lt t\lt \infty}.
  \end{ParamEq}
</me>
</p>
<p>

  We can <em>always</em> parameterize the graph of a function the same
  way we just parameterized <m>y=x^2</m>. A parameterization of <m>y=y(x)</m>,
  with domain <m>a\le x\le b</m> is
  <me>
    P(t)=
    \begin{ParamEq}
    {  x(t)=t}
    {  y(t)=y(t)}
    {  t\in [a,b]}
    \end{ParamEq}.
</me>
</p>
<p>

  This parameterization is  equivalent to working with the function
  <m>y=y(x)</m> so it may or may not be particularly useful, but
  it can always be done.

As we've seen we can always parameterize the graph of a function, but
the reverse is not true.  A parameterized curve will not always be the
graph of some function.  For example the curves in
<xref ref="PROBLEMClassicalCurves1">Problem~\</xref> are not  graphs of  functions,
but all of these curves can be parameterized.
</p>
<p>

Because  it can't always be accomplished there is no general strategy for
expressing a parameterized curve as the graph of a function. One
strategy that sometimes works
is to find <m>\dfdx{y}{x}</m> and <q>undifferentiate</q>  as in the
following example.

<title>Bridges</title>


<p>

In the previous section all of the quantities we were looking at were
time dependent -- they were in motion -- so it was useful to think of
the derivative, <m>\dfdx{y}{t}</m>, as a velocity (fluxion). In other
applications, where the quantities involved are not time dependent,
the derivative is still a useful tool but thinking of it as a velocity
may not be as useful.
</p>
<p>

For example, consider the shape of the support cable on a stable
suspension bridge as seen in the picture below. The shape of the suspension cable appears to be parabolic, but
how can we be sure of this?
</p>

<image source="images/GoldenGatebyModestosUrbanos1.png" width="60%" />
<!-- \centerline{\includegraphics*[height=2.3in,width=4in]{../Figures/GoldenGatebyModestosUrbanos1}} -->

<p>
At any given moment there are a lot of forces acting on a bridge, but
most  are insignificant most of the time. The mantra of
mathematical modeling is to keep things as simple as possible (at
least in the beginning) by focusing on the dominant parameter
first.
</p>

<aside>
<title>Comment</title>

<p>
Or, equivalently, we set the secondary parameters equal to zero.  In
this case the dominant force involved is clearly the weight of the
bridge itself.
</p>
</aside>

<p>
We assume that the weight density of the deck of the bridge is <m>W</m>
newtons per meter. The cable adds to the weight of the bridge as
well, but  it is relatively small compared to the weight of the
deck. So we will ignore it to keep the model simple.  Assuming the deck
is horizontal, we can take it to be the <m>x</m> axis
</p>

<aside>
<title>Terminology</title>
<p>
A <term>newton</term> is a unit of force named, obviously, after Isaac
Newton.
</p>
</aside>

<p>

Now suppose the graph of <m>y=y(x)</m> represents the cable between two
upright towers located at <m>x=-U</m> and <m>x=U.</m> Remember, though we
suspect that <m>y(x)</m> is a parabola we don't yet know if this
is true.
\centerline{\includegraphics*[height=1in,width=5in]{../Figures/Bridge1}}
We choose an arbitrary point <m>(x,y)</m> on the curve with
<m>0\lt x\lt U</m> and
focus on the portion of the bridge between <m>(-x,y)</m> and <m>(x,y)</m>.
\centerline{\includegraphics*[height=1in,width=5in]{../Figures/Bridge2}}
These are the two points that are holding up the section of the bridge
on the interval from <m>-x</m> to <m>x</m>.  The arrows represent the tangential
forces felt on the cable at the points.
</p>
<p>

We'll examine the the horizontal and vertical components of the
tangential force at various points on the bridge.
\centerline{\includegraphics*[height=1.7in,width=6in]{../Figures/Bridge6}}
Since the curve is symmetric, we only draw the half where <m>x\ge
0</m>.
</p>
<p>

Notice the tangential force at <m>x=0</m>, which we have labeled <m>-T</m>, is
horizontal. This reflects the fact that at that point the vertical
force would be the weight for the deck from <m>x=0</m> to <m>x=0</m> which is
zero
 (You’ll see why we used negatives momentarily.)
Hence the tangential force is equal to the horizontal tension, <m>-H</m>.
</p>

<aside>
<title>Comment</title>
<p>
This is why it’s the lowest point, there is no vertical pull.
</p>
</aside>

<p>

As we move away from the center of the cable to some point <m>x_1</m>, there is more
of the deck to support. Since we are ignoring the weight of the cable,
the vertical force is equal to the weight of the deck from <m>x=0</m> to
<m>x_1</m> so the tangential tension gets larger as we move to the
right. The horizontal tension at every single point will be the same as
the tension at the origin. What varies is the vertical component of
the force.
</p>
<p>



The cumulative effect can also be thought of this way. The point on
the cable at <m>x = 20</m> meters must not only support the weight of the deck
from <m>x = 10</m> meters to <m>x = 20</m> meters, but must bear the brunt of the load at the
point <m>x = 10</m> meters as well. This leads to the vertical force at <m>x
= 20</m> meters
being <m>-10W \text{ newtons }- 10W \text{ newtons }= -20W</m> newtons. The
point at <m>x = 30</m> meters must support whatever
weight there is at <m>x = 20</m> meters along with the extra weight from <m>x
= 20</m> meters
to <m>x = 30</m> meters which totals <m>-20W \text{ newtons }- 10W \text{
  newtons }= -30W</m> newtons. If you were hoisting a
person carrying a bucket of sand, then you would be bearing the weight
of both the person and the sand even though that person is only bearing
the weight of the sand. This is the same idea.

<p>
The conclusion of this analysis is that at any point <m>(x, y)</m> on the
curve, the tangential force pulling against the cable has a horizontal
component of <m>-H</m> and a vertical component of <m>-Wx</m>. To stabilize the
bridge, we need the cable to be pulling with the same force in exactly
the opposite direction. This leads to the sketch at the right. (Now
you see why we used negatives before.)

<p>
With our simplifying assumptions in place it appears that  the cable on a
suspension bridge does indeed  hang in the shape of a parabola. But the
suspension bridge has to hold up the deck beneath it. After all,
that is its purpose.

What shape do you think a chain takes on if it is pinned at both ends,
and allowed to hang freely in between? Take your best guess and don’t
worry about guessing correctly. We'll solve this problem shortly.
</p>
<p>


If you guessed that the curve is a parabola, then you are in good
company.  Galileo also believed that a hanging chain assumed a
parabolic shape as we see in the following passage from
his book

    equal to the length of the prism. This chain will assume the form

<p>
    This problem is very similar to finding the shape of the
    suspension bridge cable.  The difference here is that since there
    is no deck to support, the only vertical force will be the weight
    of the chain itself, so we can't ignore the weight of the chain
    the way we ignored the weight of the cable in the suspension
    bridge.
</p>
<p>
    Let <m>w</m> represent the weight density of the chain in newtons per
    meter and <m>s</m> represent the length of the chain from the lowest
    point to a point <m>P=(x,y)</m> on the chain.  Show that the curve
    represented by the chain must satisfy the differential equation
    <me>
      \dfdx{y}{x}=\frac{ws}{H}.\label{eq:Catenary1}
</me>
</p>
</statement>
</problem>
<p>

  OK, but so what? All <xref ref="EQCatenary1">Equation~</xref>) says is that the
  proportion <m>\dfdx{y}{x}</m> is equal to the proportion <m>\frac{ws}{H}</m>.
</p>
<p>

  If we could <em>solve</em> this equation for <m>y(x)</m> then the graph of
  <m>y</m> would be the shape of the chain, but sadly we don't have the
  tools to do that (yet).
</p>
<p>

  So why did we bother writing down
  <xref ref="EQCatenary1">Equation~</xref>) at all? Does this tell us anything
  about the shape of the hanging chain?
</p>
<p>

  Yes. Actually it does.
</p>
<p>

  The fact is that in our attempts to describe the world around us
  using mathematics we can't actually solve <em>most</em> of the
  equations we write down. Real world phenomena are just too
  complex. But just writing them down is a step forward.
  Although we can't (yet) solve <xref ref="EQCatenary1">Equation~</xref>), and
  thereby find the shape of a hanging chain, we can use it to
  eliminate some shapes.  In particular, we can now show that Galileo
  was wrong about the shape of a hanging chain.

<p>
Galileo's brilliance is not at all diminished  by this error.
As we said in <xref ref="CHAproblem-solving">Chapter</xref>, smart people make
mistakes!  This is how they get to be smart. You should follow the
example of Galileo (and Newton, and Leibniz) by making and embracing
lots of mistakes. But don't forget to learn from them as well.
Also, in fairness to Galileo, he did not have access to  the Calculus tools that
make this problem tractable. We do.

<p>

 In <xref ref="PICcatenary">Problem\</xref> we saw that the shape of a hanging chain is not a
parabola as Galileo believed. But it actually shows much more than
that. It shows that the shape of a hanging chain is not the graph of
any polynomial regardless of its degree. (A parabola is the
graph of
a polynomial of degree <m>2</m>.) This result tell us   that the set of
polynomials is too small to model all of the phenomena we observe in
the world. The solution of the hanging chain problem  will require a larger class of
functions.
</p>
<p>

The curve which <em>does</em> satisfy
<xref ref="EQCatenary1">equation~</xref>), and thus is the shape of a hanging
chain is called the catenary. This is
not especially illuminating since
the word <q>catenary</q> is derived from the Latin word {\it catena}
which simply means chain.

<title>Telescopes</title>
<p>
     Though he didn't invent the telescope, Galileo is usually cited
     as the first
     person to use a telescope to discover, for example,
     craters and mountains on the surface of the Moon, the phases
     Venus, and the moons of Jupiter. This work helped convince
     Galileo of the validity
     of
     <url href="https://mathshistory.st-andrews.ac.uk/Biographies/Copernicus/" visual="https://mathshistory.st-andrews.ac.uk/Biographies/Copernicus/">Nicolaus Copernicus</url>'s heliocentric (sun-centered) model of the
     solar system, for which he (Galileo) was eventually condemned by
     the Inquisition.
</p>
<aside>

<xref ref="https://mathshistory.st-andrews.ac.uk/Biographies/Harriot/">Thomas

observations.

<p>
     All telescopes follow one of two basic designs, refractive and
     reflective. Refractive telescopes us the refractive property of
     light described by Snell's Law (see
     <xref ref="SECsnells-law-refr">Section</xref>) to reduce the large image
     entering the telescope to a smaller area, thus focusing the image
     for the observer. Galileo used a refractive telescope
</p>
<p>
  Refractive telescopes work well for relatively close objects, but
  since refraction separates light into its various color components
  (think of light passing through a prism) it tends to create little
  rainbows (usually called chromatic aberrations) in the image.
</p>

<!--     \label{fig:MountGraham} -->

<p>

  Because of his work in optics, Newton realized that he could use the
  reflective properties of the parabola to achieve greater
  magnification with a smaller physical device while simultaneously
  avoiding the chromatic aberrations.  All modern research telescopes
  are built on Newton's
  original design, which uses parabolic mirrors
  to reflect light toward the focus of the par\-a\-bo\-la, where a
  secondary mirror reflects it to the eyepiece.
</p>
<p>

  For example the each mirror of the two large mirrors required by the
  Large Binocular Telescope at Mt. Graham, Arizona is <m>8.4</m> meters in
  diameter.  The image below
  gives a sense of the size of one of these mirrors.
</p>
        
<image source="images/SpinCasting1.png" width="60%" />
<!-- \centerline{\includegraphics*[height=1.2in,width=2.5in]{../Figures/SpinCasting1}} -->

<p>

  To produce a large, perfectly parabolic mirror
  the <url href="https://mirrorlab.arizona.edu/" visual="https://mirrorlab.arizona.edu/">Richard F. Caris Mirror
    Laboratory</url> uses a process called spin casting, where
   high quality borosilicate glass is place into a revolving furnace.  As
  the furnace spins the glass liquefies and the rotational forces push
  the surface of the glass into a parabolic shape.
</p>
<p>


  As  the molten glass spins the middle goes down and the
  sides go up. As we will see momentarily the surface generated must
  be a parabola.  The shape of the mirror, and hence
its focal
  length, will be affected by the rotational speed of the glass. The
  question is, how fast must we spin the furnace to produce a
  particular focal length?
</p>
<p>

  To begin to answer that question we will need to think about a typical point
  mass at a point on the surface of the molten glass as shown below.
  Suppose the glass is spinning at an angular
velocity of <m>\omega</m>~<m>\frac{\text{radians}}{\text{second}}</m>.  Our task
is to find the function <m>y=y(x)</m> whose graph is shape of a
cross-section of the surface of the liquid glass.
</p>
  
<image source="images/Spincasting8.png" width="60%" />
<!-- \centerline{\includegraphics*[height=1.8in,width=4.2in]{../Figures/Spincasting8}} -->

<p>

The red arrow in the diagram depicts the force keeping
the point mass elevated and spinning in a circle. It will be
perpendicular to the surface of the liquid, as shown.  (Think about a
hose with a hole in it.  The water sprays out in a stream
perpendicular to the hose.)
</p>
<p>

If we separate that force into its vertical and horizontal components,
as shown in the diagram, the magnitude of the vertical component of the
force is <m>mg</m>, where <m>g</m> is the acceleration due to gravity.  This is
the force needed to counter the weight of the particle.  The only
horizontal force is the centripetal force due to the spinning of the
furnace, which is <m>mx\omega^2</m>.  (We will derive this formula
analytically in <xref ref="CHAcalc-trig">Chapte</xref> when we have extended the
scope of our differentiation rules.  For now we will assume this is
correct and proceed.)

  In antiquity the reflective properties of all of the conic sections

  geometric arguments. In <xref ref="CHAPTERScienceBeforeCalc">Chapter</xref> we
  saw that Roberval reestablished these properties using his more

  will reestablish the reflective property of the parabola once more
  using a combination of Geometry and Calculus.

  Recall from <xref ref="CHAPTERScienceBeforeCalc">Chapter</xref> that any light
  ray  parallel to the axis of a parabola will reflect to a
