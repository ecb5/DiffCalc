<!-- \label{sec:slopes-tangents} -->


As we observed in <xref ref="SECsome-rules-diff">Chapter</xref> Newton, Leibniz,
and their contemporaries extended the Principle of Local Linearity to
its logical limit. They said if you cut out an infinitely small
section of a curve then the section actually is an infinitely short
straight line segment. Of course we are quite familiar with infinitely
short line segments. We call them differentials.

Leibniz called a triangle whose sides are differentials, like the blue
triangle in the figure at the right, a \term{differential triangle}\aside{Because,
  what else would you call it?}.  In the figure $\dx{y}$ and
$\dx{x}$ are differentials in the vertical and horizontal directions,
respectively. But $\dx{s}$ is a differential at the point $(a, a^2)$ in the direction of the
curve  or, what comes to  the same thing, in the
direction tangent to the curve. Thus $\dx{s}$ is a differential
along the curve, and simultaneously  along the line
tangent to the curve\aside{The idea that $\dx{s}$ is a
  straight line segment on the curve and also on its tangent
    line is a bit  troubling. It is one of many bizarre consequences
    of  the notion of differentials.}.

  Notice that from the Pythagorean Theorem we have
  <me>

    \label{eq:PythTheorDiff}
    (\dx{s})^2=(\dx{x})^2+(\dx{y})^2.
  
</me>
  We will find Equation~\ref{eq:PythTheorDiff} very useful. 



The differentials $\dx{x}$, and $\dx{y}$, don't really tell us much
about the graph of $y=x^2$, but the \term{differential ratio},
$\dfdx{y}{x}$, does. At each point, $(a, a^2)$, $\dfdx{y}{x}$ gives us
the slope of $\d{s}$ and the line tangent to the curve at that point.
Loosely speaking, the differential ratio $\dfdx{y}{x}$ gives the slope
of the curve at each point.


If we want to find the slope of the curve $y=x^2$ at the point
$(a,a^2)$ we simply find $\d{y}$  as usual:$ \dx{y}=2x\dx{x}$.  Then
we take the extra step of dividing through by $\dx{x}$ to get
$\dfdx{y}{x}=2x$.  Evaluating this at the point $x=a$, $y=a^2$, and
$\dfdx{y}{x}=2a$ which will give us
the slope of the line tangent to the graph of $y=x^2$ at the point
$(a,a^2)$.

\begin{ProficiencyDrill}
  Find an equation of the line tangent to the graph of $y=x^2$ at
  each of the following points.
  \begin{enumerate}[label={  (\alph*)}]
    \begin{multicols}{5}
    \item $(-2,4)$
    \item $(-1,1)$
    \item $(0,0)$
    \item $(1,1)$
    \item $(2,4)$
    \end{multicols}
  \end{enumerate}
    Compare these results to those obtained using Fermat's Method in
  Problem~\#\ref{prob:ferm-meth-x2}
\end{ProficiencyDrill}

\begin{Digression}[Evaluation Notation]
  We will frequently need to evaluate the expression $\dfdx{y}{x}$ at
  different points. This can quickly become very confusing unless we
  have some way of indicating which point is under
  consideration. To avoid  confusion, we  use the notation \\
  \centerline{ $\eval{\dfdx{y}{x}}{(x,y)}{(a,b)}$ or
    $\geneval{\dfdx{y}{x}}{(a,b)}$.  } This notation is very
  flexible. Frequently the $y$ coordinate will not
  be in play. In that case we write \\
  \centerline{$\eval{\dfdx{y}{x}}{x}{a}$} to indicate that we are
  evaluating $\dfdx{y}{x}$ at the point $x=a$.
\end{Digression}
\begin{myexample}
    For example to compute the slope of the graph of $y=3x^2-5x$ at
    $(3,12)$ we use the following three-step process.
    \begin{enumerate}
    \item First  differentiate $y=3x^2-5x$ to obtain the
      differential equation $\dx{y}=(6x-5)\dx{x}$. This 
      relates $\dx{y}$ and $\dx{x}$.
    \item Second, from this differential equation we 
      find the ratio  $\dfdx{y}{x}=6x-5.$ This
      differential ratio tells us the slope of the curve at
      every point on the curve.
    \item Third, if we need the value of $\dfdx{y}{x}$ at a single
      point like $(3,12)$, for example\aside{Obviously this makes no
        sense if the point $(3,12)$ is not a point on the curve. You
        should always make sure the problem makes sense before you
        try to solve it.}, we compute
      $$\eval{\dfdx{y}{x}}{(x,y)}{(3,12)}=\bigeval{6
        x-5}{(x,y)}{(3,12)}=6\cdot3-5=13.$$

   In this case we
      could just write: $\eval{\dfdx{y}{x}}{x}{3}=13$, since the $y$
      coordinate never comes into play.
    \end{enumerate}
    Finally, we emphasize that Leibniz' notation is
    \emph{deliberately} evocative of the notion of slope because when
    we evaluate the differential ratio at a point it tells us the
    slope of the curve at that point.  In view of the \alert{Principle
      of Local Linearity}, this is equivalent to finding the slope of
    the line tangent to the curve at that point.
  \end{myexample}

  This notation probably seems unnecessarily cumbersome and honestly, in
  some ways it is. But be assured we have not made this choice
  lightly, and this notation has certain advantages that will become
  apparent later.

  It can be easy to get careless or simply confused and write $\dfdx{y}{x}$
  when you mean $\eval{\dfdx{y}{x}}{x}{a}$, and \foreign{vice versa},
  so it is important that you have the distinction between them clear
  in your mind.

\begin{embeddedproblem-enumerate}
  \begin{enumerate}[label={  (\alph*)}]
    \item Explain the difference between $\dfdx{y}{x}$ and
      $\eval{\dfdx{y}{x}}{x}{a}$ carefully and clearly.
    \item We (the authors) have sometimes had students assert that
      since $\dfdx{y}{x}=2x$, the equation of the line tangent to the
      graph of $y=x^2$ at the point $(a, a^2)$ is
      <me>

      y-a^2=2x(x-a).\label{eq:TanLineNoLine}
    
</me>
    Set $a=3$. Is this the equation of a line?
  \item Find the correct formula for line tangent to the graph of
    $y=x^2$ at the point $(a, a^2)$.  
  \end{enumerate}
\end{embeddedproblem-enumerate}

\begin{ProficiencyDrill}
  Find $\eval{\dfdx{y}{x}}{(x,y)}{(2,2)}$ if $y=\sqrt{2x}$ and compare this with the slope
  we obtained in Drill~\#\ref{prob:DescartesNormals2} using
  Descartes' Method of Normals.
\end{ProficiencyDrill}

\pagebreak[4]
  \begin{embeddedproblem}
    \label{embedded:Deri}
    Evaluate $\eval{\dfdx{y}{x}}{x}{a}$ for each of the following
    functions at each of the given values of $x$.
    \begin{enumerate}[label={  (\alph*)}] 
    \item $y=x^3$, $a=0,\pm1,\pm2$ (Compare with
      Problem~\#\ref{prob:ferm-meth-x2}.)
    \item $y=x^3+2x^2$, $a=0,\pm1,\pm2$ (Compare with
      Problem~\#\ref{prob:ferm-meth-aedeq-1}.)
    \item $y=\sqrt{x}$, $a=4$ (Compare with
      Problem~\#\ref{prob:DescartesNormals1}.)
    \end{enumerate}
                      \end{embeddedproblem}



There is real temptation at this point to cut corners and compute the
differential ratio
$\dfdx{y}{x}$ all in one step. On purely practical grounds, we urge you to
differentiate first and then divide by $\dx{x}$ in two separate
steps. Our reasons are two-fold.  First, the rules we've learned are
\emph{differentiation} rules. They were designed to compute
differentials, not differential ratios.  Second, in applications
to come we will see that dividing by $\dx{x}$ will not always move the
solution process forward. It can sometimes even get in the way,
depending on the problem.

Nonetheless, as you gain more experience and a deeper understanding
you will find yourself gravitating toward the differential ratio more
and more. This is a normal progression. As we have said before
differentials are an intermediate step, a convenient fiction. You
don't want to become tied to them for life.

\section{Defining the Tangent Line}
\label{sec:defin-tang-line}
\begin{wrapfigure}[9]{l}{1in}
  \vskip-6mm

  \centerline{\includegraphics*[height=1.5in,width=1in]{../Figures/TangentLineDef6}}
  \label{fig:TangentLineDef6}
\end{wrapfigure}
The word tangent comes from the Latin word \foreign{tangere} (to
touch).  So you'd think it would be easy to define what we mean by
``tangent line.'' When asked, most people will come up with something
like, ``The line tangent to a curve is the line that touches the curve
at exactly one point.'' Does this seem like a reasonable definition to
you? Stop and think about it for a few minutes. We're obviously
offering a plausible sounding definition that we know won't work. Do
you see the problem?

It certainly \emph{seems} OK, and if we check it with a few simple
examples everything looks reasonable. 
But consider a small segment of the graph of $y=x^3$
at the point $(1,1)$ and its corresponding tangent line as seen at
the left.

\begin{wrapfigure}[]{r}{1in}
  \vskip-3mm 
  \captionsetup{labelformat=empty}
  \centerline{\includegraphics*[height=1.7in,width=1in]{../Figures/TangentLineDef7}}
  \label{fig:TangentLineDef7}
\end{wrapfigure}
While this certainly fits our notion of a tangent line touching a
curve only once, look what happens if we zoom out (see the sketch at
the right).  This supposed tangent line will cross (touch) the
graph of the curve a second time.  In fact, there is only one point on
the graph of $y=x^3$ where the tangent line touches the graph only
once. Do you see which point that is?  Give this a few minutes
thought.

In view of what we've just seen, what do you think the definition of a
tangent line
\emph{ought} to be?

In the figure at the right it is clear that the ``touching'' is
different at the two points. At $(1,1)$ the blue tangent line
``grazes'' the graph of $y=x^3$ at $(1,1)$ exactly as we would
expect. But at the other point it actually cuts through the graph.

 The difficulty seems to be that we said ``touch'' when we meant
``graze''.  How about this definition instead: ``The line tangent to a
curve is the line that \emph{grazes} the curve at exactly one point.''

If it is not possible for a line to ``graze'' a curve at more than one
point this could be a workable definition. Unfortunately the next
drill shows that this is not true.


\begin{ProficiencyDrill}

  $$
  y=\frac12x+\frac14 + (x-1)^2(x-2)^2(x-3)^2(x-4)^2.
  $$
  at   $x=1, 2, 3, $ and $x=4$  as seen in the
  sketch at the right.% \\
  \end{ProficiencyDrill}

\end{wrapfigure}
It appears that clearly defining what we mean by ``tangent line'' is
not as simple as it seemed to be at first. This is frustrating because
we all have a pretty clear intuitive idea of what we mean. The difficulty seems to be capturing in
words the mental image we all share.

Recall that we have informally stated   the \term{Principle of Local
  Linearity} as: ``Locally any curve is indistinguishable from a straight line.''

But which straight line?

The answer to that question is visible in the differential triangle at
the left. It is clear that, \emph{locally} (near a given point $(x,y)$
on the curve) a curve will look like the hypotenuse of the
differential triangle $\d{s}$ at the point $(x,y)$.  So we make the
following definition.

\begin{mydefinition}[The Line Tangent to a Curve  at a Point]
  \label{def:TangentLine}
  The \term{line tangent to a curve}, at the point
  $(a,b)$ is the line which passes through the point $(a,b)$
  with slope $m=\eval{\dfdx{y}{x}}{(x,y)}{(a,b)}$.
\end{mydefinition}

Do you  see what we did here? Intuitively we know what properties we want a
tangent line to have. We want it to ``touch'' or ``graze'' our
curve at a particular point but we've seen that neither of those words
quite captures everything we need. And what we need is for the tangent
line to pass through the tangent point and have the same slope as the
function at that point. So we've removed the words ``touch'' and
``graze'' in favor of the more precise, quantifiable language of Calculus. 


Since we \emph{defined} the tangent line to be the extension of
$\dx{s}$ to the finite scale we have essentially defined it to have
exactly that property we will need to make Differential Calculus
useful.  Moreover with this definition in place the \term{Principle of
  Local Linearity} can be formalized a bit more.

\begin{mydefinition}[The Principle of Local Linearity]
  \label{def:LocalLinearity}
  Sufficiently close to a given point every smooth curve is
  indistinguishable from the line tangent at that point.
\end{mydefinition}

The history of mathematics is riddled with this sort of backward
looking definition and we will see it again. For example Newton and
Leibniz both knew what they wanted their \foreign{Calculus
  Differentialus} (Leibniz) and \emph{Method of Fluxions} (Newton) to
do. They worked out their computational procedures intuitively -- just
as we started with an intuitive understanding of ``tangent line.'' But
coming up with precise definitions and a solid logical foundation was
harder. It took about $200$ years for the mathematical community to
devise definitions that gave back what intuition had led us to. This
is part of why we are not yet overly concerned about our inability to
precisely define a differential. When we finally address this issue in
Chapter~\ref{chapt:whats-wrong-with} we will not be devising any new
differentiation techniques. We will be providing logical underpinnings
for the techniques our intuition has led us to and that our experience
has shown to be useful.

  \begin{embeddedproblem}
    \label{problem:tanlinedef}
    Show that the only point on the graph of $y=x^3$ where the tangent
    line touches the curve \emph{only} at the point of tangency is the
    point $(0, 0)$ and that the tangent is horizontal.

    Now graph the curve and the line tangent at $(0,0)$ on the same
    set of axes. Does this \emph{look} like a tangent line to you?
  \end{embeddedproblem}
  
  Does the graph help you see the significance of
  Problem~\#\ref{problem:tanlinedef}? The line tangent to the graph of
  $y=x^3$ at the point $(0,0)$ actually crosses the graph at that
  point.  This is weird. And it is exactly counter to our original
  understanding of what it means for a line to be tangent to a curve
  isn't it?

The next problem will probably strike you as equally weird. But in
both problems the weirdness is a logical consequence of our definition
of tangent line, so we will accept it as long as it doesn't lead to
inconsistencies.

Weirdness is acceptable. It is inconsistency that we need to avoid.

  Show that if  $y^2=x^3-3x+1$ then $\dfdx{y}{x}=\frac{3x^2-3}{2y}$.
\end{ProficiencyDrill-1line}


In Drill~\#\ref{drill:ZeroDenominator1} it is tempting to to say that
$\dfdx{y}{x}=\frac{3x^2-3}{2y}$ will give us the slope of the tangent
line tangent to the curve at \emph{any} point $(x,y).$ Typically this would
be correct.  But not always.
For example  the tangent line of this curve  is horizontal
(has slope equal to zero) when
$$
0=\dfdx{y}{x}=\frac{3x^2-3}{2y}.
$$

\begin{wrapfigure}[]{r}{1.2in}
  \vskip-4mm 
\captionsetup{labelformat=empty}
\centerline{\includegraphics*[height=1.2in,width=1.2in]{../Figures/EllipticCurve2}}
\label{fig:EllipticCurve2}
\end{wrapfigure}
Solving this gives $x=\pm1$. It is plainly
visible on the graph at the right that there is  a horizontal tangent line
when $x=-1$.
But notice that there is no point on the graph where $x=1$! 
Obviously it is meaningless to ask for the slope of a curve at a point that
isn't on the curve.

Even if we didn't have the graph to look at we could still tell that
at $x=1$ there is no tangent line.  Setting $x=1$ and trying to solve for
the corresponding $y$ values we get $y^2=1-3+1=-1$. Since there is no
real number that satisfies the equation $y^2=-1$ we conclude that
there is no point on the graph with $x$-coordinate equal to $1$.

On the other hand, there are three values of $x$ that correspond to
$y=0$.  These would be difficult to compute but from the graph we can
see that the tangent line is most likely vertical at all three points.
To compute $\dfdx{y}{x}=\frac{3x^2-3}{2y}$ at each of these points
we would have to divide by $y=0$.

Obviously when we divide a number by
zero we get infinity, and just as obviously the slope of a vertical
line is also infinity so everything fits. Right?
No, of course not. This is just a very deceptive coincidence.

Many
students come into a Calculus with the impression that
dividing by zero results in either zero or infinity.
  It does not. Division by zero is not meaningful.

  Mathematicians say that division by zero is an \term{undefined
    operation} or simply that it is \term{undefined}. At first it is
  not at all clear why this is, so let's take look at this
  question.

  What does it mean to divide by any number? To take a very concrete
  example, what does it mean to divide a length of five
  units\aside{The units could be inches, picometers, or
    light-years. We don't care.} by seventeen? It means we want to
  divide the length into seventeen equally sized pieces, right?  But
  if we want to divided $5$ units by zero, obviously we can't divide
  five into zero pieces. So in this very concrete example the phrase
  ``five divided by zero'' is simply and utterly without meaning.

  From a slightly more abstract viewpoint we could ask for the length
  of each piece when we divide a length of five into seventeen pieces.
  We get $\frac{5}{17}$ of course. That's what the fraction notation
  means\aside{Just as  $\frac12$ is the number we get when we
  divide one into two pieces.}. But what number do we get when we divide
  five into zero pieces. Once again the idea has no meaning.

  Taking an even more abstract point of view,  observe that multiplication and division are inverse
  operations (they undo each other). Twelve divided by three is four
  $\left(\frac{12}{3}=4\right)$ precisely because when we
  multiply three times four we get twelve ($3\times 4 =12$).

  Now don't think of five as a length to be divided, think of it
  instead as simply a number. So what number can we multiply
  by zero to get five? Obviously there isn't any such number so this
  is a meaningless question.

  No matter what we try or how we look at it we cannot find any
  way to make  division by zero meaningful.
  

        \end{Digression}

Since we can't divide by zero we will need to be a bit more careful
about how we interpret the symbol $\dfdx{y}{x}$. It will give us the
slope of the curve (equivalently, the slope of the tangent line) as
long as $\dfdx{y}{x}$ has meaning. But when $y$ is zero
$\dfdx{y}{x}=\frac{3x^2-3}{2y}$ is meaningless.  Thus it appears that
for this particular curve we can draw no conclusions whatsoever from
our formula about the tangent line when $y=0$. In this case we say
that the differential quotient is \term{undefined}. In general, the
differential quotient is \term{undefined} at any point where
evaluating $\dfdx{y}{x}$ requires a division by zero.

Does this mean we can draw no conclusions at all? Certainly not. In
fact those values of $x$ or $y$ where $\dfdx{y}{x}$ is undefined will
often turn out to be the most useful. But we are not yet quite prepared to
see how to deal with them properly so we will defer this discussion
until a later point.

At the very least this warns us that there are subtleties that must be
dealt with when using a powerful tool like Calculus. We will avoid
these subtleties for a bit longer, but you need to know that they
exist. Don't try to force matters by, for example, blindly dividing by
zero as if it is meaningful. We will return to these matters when we
have a better understanding of the underlying principles.

These last three problems illustrate that while many otherwise
difficult computations can be done ``in these lines, as if by magic'' (to
quote Leibniz) there are still a great many subtleties to be
accounted for. There is still plenty of room for creative, analytical
problem solving.

We will come back to some of these subtleties later. For now keep in
mind that while Calculus is a very powerful tool it does not allow us
to solve all problems blindly, by simply moving the pebbles.


\section{The Vomit Comet}
\label{sec:vomit-comet}
To acclimate astronaut train\-ees to the effects of weightlessness,
NASA uses the following training regimen: It has an airplane perform a
series of steep climbs and sharp dives.  At the top of
each climb passengers will experience weightlessness for about $25$
seconds.  During a training flight the pilot will repeat this maneuver
about $40$
times.

\begin{wrapfigure}[10]{r}{2.4in}
  \vskip-4mm 
  \captionsetup{labelformat=empty}
  \centerline{\href{https://historycollection.jsc.nasa.gov/JSCHistoryPortal/history/oral_histories/SlezakTR/gallery/pages/S85-44833.htm}{\includegraphics*[height=1.6in,width=2.4in]{../Figures/VomitComet1}}}
  \label{fig:VomitComet}
\end{wrapfigure}

Because this ``roller coast\-er'' ride sometimes causes nausea for the
passengers the planes used for the maneuver have been christened
``Vomit Comets.''  One of these airplanes was used to film the weightless
scenes in the $1995$ film
\href{https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0112384/}{Apollo 13}.

It is well known that the path of an object moving only under the
influence of the Earth's gravity\aside{That is, we're ignoring air
  resistance.} at the surface of the earth is parabolic. To simulate
weightlessness\aside{More precisely, to create neutral buoyancy.}
inside the plane the Vomit Comet is flown so that its flight path
matches such a parabolic flight. That is, its shape will be the graph
of a curve having the form
$$
y=Ax^2+Bx+C.
$$
We'd like to find the values of the unknown parameters $A$, $B$, and
$C$ that match the path of an object moving under the influence of
Earth's gravity.  Once these are known we will also be able to
determine the peak altitude of the flight and how far (horizontally)
it will go before coming back to the altitude where the maneuver
began. That is, we can find the point where the pilot should pull out of the
dive. Finally we'd like to confirm the claim that this maneuver takes
about $25$ seconds.

Can we find $A$, $B$, and $C$? No. Unfortunately we don't
yet have enough information to determine $A$, but we can find $B$ and
$C$.

\pagebreak[4]

\begin{embeddedproblem}
  \label{problem:FlightPath2}
  Suppose the following graph depicts the parabolic flight path
  followed by the Vomit Comet as it starts its maneuver at an altitude
  of $7000$ meters and an initial angle of elevation of $45^\circ$.\\
  \centerline{\includegraphics*[height=2in,width=2in]{../Figures/VomitComet2}}
  If the equation of this parabola is $ y=Ax^2+Bx+C,$ then  determine the values of $B$ and $C$.
\end{embeddedproblem}

Ultimately to find $A$, we'll need to have a better model of the motion.
Fortunately, Calculus is exactly the right tool for building such a
model but we don't yet have all of the pieces we need.  We will
return to the Vomit Comet problem once we have them.


The pilot of a Vomit Comet seeks to simulate weightlessness, but the
pilot of a commercial airliner works hard to avoid subjecting
its passengers to extreme effects like weightlessness or, at the other
end, of extreme gravity so it must descend more gradually.  This
situation is a little easier to understand so we will explore it in
the next couple of problems and examples before returning to the Vomit
Comet.


\begin{myexample}[Modeling the flight path of an airliner ]
  \label{example:FlightPath}
  We want to model the flight path of a plane as it lands and
  determine the distance from the runway the plane should be when it
  starts its descent. 

  A fundamental tenet of mathematically modeling real world phenomena
  is to keep things as simple as possible. So, the first thing we'd be
  likely to try for is a parabolic descent path:
  $$y=Ax^2+Bx+C.$$
  But it is pretty clear that this won't work because the
  plane should be traveling horizontally at the beginning and at the end
  of its descent. At the end, because at that point it should be on
  the ground, and at the beginning because we don't want to terrify
  the passengers.
  

    \begin{ProficiencyDrill}
      Show that there is only one point on any parabola where the line
      tangent to the curve is horizontal. Explain why this proves that the
      flight path of the airliner in Example \#\ref{example:FlightPath}
      cannot be parabolic. \\
      \hint{Wherever the flight path
        is horizontal its slope will be zero.}
    \end{ProficiencyDrill}

  
  The next simplest curve we could use would be a cubic polynomial
  <me>

    y=Ax^3+Bx^2+Cx+D.\label{eq:FlightPath}
  
</me>
  
  \begin{embeddedproblem}
    \label{problem:FlightPath1}
    Below is a section of a cubic polynomial depicting a flight path with the plane
    starting initially at the point $P(l,h)$ and ending at the airport
    $Q$ which we will
    arbitrarily designate as  the origin.\\
             \centerline{\includegraphics*[height=2in,width=4.5in]{../Figures/Descent1}}
    \begin{enumerate}[label={  (\alph*)}]
    \item Assuming that the flight path is the graph of
      Equation~\ref{eq:FlightPath}, compute $\dx{y}$. Then divide by
      $\dx{x}$ to obtain $\dfdx{y}{x}$.
    \item Show that $D=0$ in Equation~(\ref{eq:FlightPath}). \\
      \hint{The point $(0,0)$ is on the graph
        of Equation~\ref{eq:FlightPath}.}
    \item Show that $C=0$  in Equation~(\ref{eq:FlightPath}). \\
      \hint{The flight path is horizontal at
        $(0,0)$.}
    \item Determine the values of $A$ and $B$  in
      Equation~(\ref{eq:FlightPath}) in terms of $l$ and
      $h$. \\
      \hint{The point $P$ is on the flight path and the flight
        path is horizontal at $P$.}
    \end{enumerate}
  \end{embeddedproblem}
\end{myexample}



We've taken our analysis of the flight paths of both the Vomit Comet
and our airliner as far as we can using slopes alone. The problem is
that a flight path is like a road. A road doesn't go anywhere. It just
sits there. But an object traveling along a road (or a flight path) is
moving. It has a velocity and an acceleration.

Analyzing a static path does not allow us to model either the velocity
or the acceleration of an object moving along that path. Fortunately
for us, Newton's formulation of Calculus is just what we need to do
attack these problems.

But since the Vomit Comet aims to replicate the path of a body falling
freely under the influence of gravity  we will also 
need to consider the influence of  gravity.

In the previous section we asserted -- with no justification
whatsoever -- that the flight path of the Vomit Comet would be
parabolic. Then, in Problem~\ref{problem:FlightPath2}, we gave you the
task of finding the constants $B$, and $C$ for which the graph of
the curve $$y=Ax^2+Bx+C$$ is the flight path of the Vomit Comet with
an initial angle of elevation of $45^\circ$. You
should have obtained
$$
y=Ax^2+x+7000.
$$


Inside the airplane, we want what is called \term{neutral buoyancy}.
This means that we don't want any forces pushing us up or down, side
to side, or back and forth relative to the
airplane\aside{Naturally, if the plane and everything in it are
  falling towards the earth then the force of gravity is in play. But
  if everything falls together there is no force inside
  (relative to) the plane.}. The way to assure this is to force the
airplane to fly along the same path it would take if it were unpowered
and falling freely.  At first it might seem like all we have to do is
shut down the engine, but that won't work because air resistance will
prevent the plane from falling freely.  The engines must be
engaged to force the plane along the path it would follow naturally if
there were no atmosphere\aside{Also, it is incredibly dangerous to
  turn off the engines of an airplane while it is flying.}, and thus, no
resistive forces.  In this section we'll see why this path must be
in the shape of a parabola.



Newton very famously said, ``If I have been able to see further, it is
by standing on the shoulders of giants,''
and, in his $1684$ paper on Calculus, Leibniz remarked that ``Other
very learned men have sought in many devious ways what someone versed
in this calculus can accomplish in these lines as by magic.''

As we've seen Fermat, Descartes, and Roberval were three of the
learned giants Newton and Leibniz were indebted to.  Another was
Professor Galilei (1564-1642) of the University of Pisa, who is
universally known and referred to by his first name,
\href{https://mathshistory.st-andrews.ac.uk/Biographies/Galileo/}{Galileo}. As
a professor of mathematics at Pisa, Galileo studied, among other
things, how objects moved under the influence of gravity.

We will be following Galileo's lead to address such questions as:
\begin{itemize}  
\item Suppose you throw a ball straight up into the air. How high will
  the ball go?
\item How long will it take for it to hit the ground and  what will its velocity be at impact?
\item If you throw the ball up  twice as hard. Will it go twice as high?
\end{itemize}

Since Galileo had neither the technology nor the mathematics to
account for air resistance he ignored it.  For the moment we will ignore
it too.

\pagebreak[4]

  \begin{embeddedproblem}
    \label{prob:TossedBall1}
    We all know from experience that if you throw a ball straight up
    in the air, it will reach some maximum height. But suppose you
    throw the ball up twice as hard, would it go twice as high?\\

      wrong. Just take your best guess.}

    \label{fig:HammerFeather}
  \end{wrapfigure}
  The accepted theory of motion in Galileo's time
  was \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aristotle}{Aristotle}'s
  assertion that a heavier object would fall faster than a lighter
  object. Our common experience is that a hammer falls faster than a
  feather so this was an entirely reasonable thing to believe at the
  time. But we now know that this is because the resistance of the air
  slows the feather more than it does the hammer.

  In $1971$, Apollo Astronaut David Scott confirmed this
  experimentally (see the video at the right) by dropping both a
  hammer and a feather on the surface of the moon. Because there is no
  air on the surface of the moon there is no air resistance, so the
  hammer and feather hit the surface of the moon at the same time.

  Since he didn't have access to the moon Galileo had to be clever
  instead.  But Galileo was one of the group of new scientists who
  gathered experimental data and applied mathematical principles to
  theories. As a result of his experimental investigations Galileo
  proposed that in the absence of air all objects would fall at the
  same rate\aside{Galileo could be quite argumentative and this
    eventually got him into hot water with the Vatican. In the last
    years of his long life he was threatened with excommunication and
    and risked execution for espousing
    \href{https://mathshistory.st-andrews.ac.uk/Biographies/Copernicus/}{Copernicus'}
    heliocentric theory of planetary motion. It was only because he
    was well known and respected as a scientist that he was only
    confined to his home instead.}.
  
How did he surmise that all objects would fall at the same rate?

Well actually, he didn't.  We need to be very careful in our use of
language here. To say that ``all objects fall at the same rate'' is a
bit sloppy. Since velocity is the rate of change of position it seems
to say that all objects fall at the same velocity.

But we know that's not true because the velocity of a falling object
depends on how long it has been falling. At the moment  you drop a ball its
velocity is zero. Thereafter it gains
velocity -- it accelerates. Thus an object that has just been
dropped is moving slowly while an object that has been falling for a
while is moving at a faster rate.


What Galileo actually proposed was that the rate of change of
the velocity -- the \term{acceleration} -- of all falling bodies is
constant. But an object falling freely under the influence of Earth's gravity
gets moving pretty quickly and in Galileo's day the tools available
for measurement were very limited. So he slowed things down by letting
small balls roll down a ramp as shown below.\\
\centerline{\includegraphics*[height=1.2in,width=2.6in]{../Figures/GalileoRamp}}
Galileo assumed (correctly) that friction with
the ramp would not significantly influence his measurements. When he
did this he noticed that the balls always seemed to accelerate at a
constant rate which depended only on the steepness of the ramp. More
precisely, the acceleration of the rolling ball varied with the angle
of descent. In modern terms we would say that the acceleration is a
function of the angle of descent.

Referring to the diagram above, it is clear that when\aside{Notice
  that we are using radians to measure the angle. If you are unsure
  what a radian is we have a brief review of Trigonometry in
  Section~(\ref{subsec:trig-interl}).\\
  For scientific computation radian measure is usually simplest, so we
  will use fairly consistently throughout this text. But degree
  measure is also common so it will occasionally make an appearance,
  like it did in Problem~\#\ref{problem:FlightPath2}. } $\theta=\pi/2$
the ball won't move at all. So its acceleration is zero. When
$\theta=0$ the ball accelerates downward freely under the influence of
gravity with no resistance\aside{Or at least, very little.}.  Galileo
measured the acceleration associated with steeper and steeper ramps
(that is for $\theta$ closer and closer to zero) obtaining a table of
values similar to the one at the left.

From the table it is clear that as $\theta$ gets closer and closer to
zero the acceleration is getting closer and closer to $9.8.$ Thus
Galileo  deduced that when there is no ramp (when
$\theta =0$) the velocity will increase each second by
$9.8\frac{\text{meters}}{\text{second}}.$ 

That is, the velocity of an object falling under the influence
of the earth's gravity increases by $9.8$ meters per second, each
second. This is usually abbreviated as $9.8\frac{\text{meters}}{\text{second}^2}$, is commonly
denoted by $g$, and is called the \term{constant of acceleration due
  to gravity}

\begin{ProficiencyDrill}
  With a little Trigonometry you can deduce that
  $g=9.8\frac{\text{meters}}{\text{second}^2}$
  with only one measurement.  Use the diagram and the first line of the
  table above to deduce that $g=9.8.$\\
  \hint{$\cos\left(\pi/3\right)=1/2$.}
\end{ProficiencyDrill}

If we drop the object from some height, then its initial velocity is
zero.  After one second it will be falling at a rate of
$9.8\frac{\text{meters}}{\text{second}}$, after two seconds, its velocity will be
$9.8\times2=19.6\frac{\text{meters}}{\text{second}}$, etc.  That is, as an object falls, its
velocity increases at the constant rate of
\(9.8\, \frac{\text{meters}}{\text{second}}\) every second: $v=9.8t.$

The specific number that Galileo found,
$9.8\frac{\text{meters}}{\text{second}^2}$, is an artifact of the units
we use to measure distance (meters) and time (seconds) and the fact
that we are on the surface of a particular planet.  If we measure
distance in feet instead then at the surface of the earth a falling
object will accelerate at $32 \frac{\text{feet}}{\text{second}^2}$. If
  we go to the surface of the moon, it will accelerate at $1.6
  \frac{\text{meters}}{\text{second}^2}$.


  \begin{ProficiencyDrill-1line} 
    Show that if we measure distance in feet, the acceleration constant
    on the moon is approximately
    $5.2\frac{\text{feet}}{\text{second}^2}.$
  \end{ProficiencyDrill-1line}
  
The general situation is this: If a falling object's velocity, in meters per second
($\frac{\text{meters}}{\text{second}}$), is changing at a constant rate of $r$ meters per second per
second ($\frac{\text{meters}}{\text{second}^2}$), and $t$ is the number of elapsed seconds then
$ v=rt.$ From Galileo's work we know that at the surface of the Earth
$r=g=9.8$ so
<me>

  v=9.8t
 \label{eq:Velocity}

</me>

We can check that this is reasonable by looking at the units of
measurement. Since the acceleration $r,$ is measured in
$\frac{\text{meters}}{\text{seconds}^2}$ and time is measured in
seconds, when they are multiplied a symbolic cancellation gives
$$
\frac{\text{meters}}{\text{second}^2}\cdot \text{second} = \frac{\text{meters}}{\text{second}\cdot \cancel{\text{second}}}\cdot \cancel{\text{second}} = \frac{\text{meters}}{\text{second}}
$$
or meters per second; the units used to measure velocity. Notice that
Equation~\ref{eq:Velocity} is independent of the weight of the falling
object. Under the influence of gravity alone all objects accelerate
downward at the same rate.




Galileo's hypothesis that all objects falling solely under the
influence of Earth's gravity accelerate at the same rate came from
both his experimental evidence and a famous thought experiment he
described in his book \pubtitle{On Motion}~(1590).  The experiment
runs as follows:
\begin{wrapfigure}[]{r}{3in}
\captionsetup{labelformat=empty}
\centerline{\href{https://www.maa.org/press/periodicals/convergence/mathematical-treasure-galileo-s-two-new-sciences}{\includegraphics*[height=3.4in,width=2.7in]{../Figures/GalileoTwoNewSciences}}}
\label{fig:GalileoTwoNewSciences}
\end{wrapfigure}
Imagine that two objects, one light and one heavy,
are connected to each other by a string and we drop them from  a great
height, say the top
of the Tower of Pisa.
If we assume heavier objects do indeed fall
faster than lighter ones the string will soon pull taut as the lighter
object retards the fall of the heavier object.

So, the system  taken as a whole will fall more slowly than the
    heavier object alone.
  But the system as a whole is heavier than either individual object.
 So, the system taken as a whole
  will fall faster than the heavier object.

  This contradiction leads inexorably to the conclusion that our initial
assumption -- that heavier objects accelerate faster -- must be false.

According to legend Galileo tested his hypothesis by dropping balls of
different weights from the top of the Tower of Pisa, but that is
almost certainly pure legend. He never actually did this.  Probably.

Galileo set out his ideas about falling objects in his last book
\foreign{Discorsi e Dimostrazioni Matematiche intorno à due nuoue
  Scienze} (Discourses and Mathematical Demonstrations Concerning Two
New Sciences) (1638). This was the last of Galileo's many scientific
works\aside{Toward the end of his life the Inquisition of the Catholic
  Church placed Galileo under house arrest in his home. His crime what
  that he had openly supported Copernicus's theory that the earth
  revolves around the sun. Rather than remain idle during his
  imprisonment he revisited his unpublished research from when he was
  younger and used that as a foundation for his final opus.}.  The two
sciences referred to in the title were the science of motion, which
became the foundation of modern physics, and the science of materials
and construction, an important contribution to engineering.

Suppose an object falls $56$ meters from the top of the Tower of Pisa to the
ground. Can we determine how fast it is moving when it strikes the ground?

Recall that the formula $v=gt$ tells us the ball's velocity at any
time $t$. So if $t_g$ is the amount of time it takes for the ball to
reach the ground then the velocity at the end would be $v=gt_g$. But
how do we find out exactly when the ball strikes the ground?

To see the difficulty, suppose we dropped the ball from
a height of $9.8$ meters.  Would it take $1$ second for the ball to
hit the ground?

Clearly not.

To reach the ground after $1$ second the ball would have to
average $9.8\frac{\text{meters}}{\text{second}}$ during the entirety of that first second.
But at first it is not moving at all (velocity $=0$). After one second
its velocity has increased to $9.8 \frac{\text{meters}}{\text{second}}$. So for the entire duration of
that first second the ball's velocity is less than $9.8
\frac{\text{meters}}{\text{second}}$. Thus after $1$ second it has not yet hit the ground because it
was never going fast enough to do so.  Exactly how far it has fallen
isn't clear.

Reasoning similarly, at the beginning of the next second the ball is
already falling at $9.8\frac{\text{meters}}{\text{second}}$ and thereafter it's velocity increases,
so it falls at least $9.8$ meters during the next second, in addition
to the distance it fell during the first. So, while we cannot yet tell
exactly how far it falls during either second, we can say that,
(1) it will not hit the ground during the first  second, and (2)  it
definitely  will hit the ground sometime during 
the next second.


If we had an expression for the ball's position, $p$, similar
to Equation~(\ref{eq:Velocity}), we would be in much better shape.
Galileo was able to determine the distance the ball fell without the
tools of Calculus, but since learning to use those tools is why we're
here, we will use them.


\section*{Bringing in Calculus}

Let $p(t)$ represent the position at time $t$ of a ball under the
influence of gravity. That is, $p(t)$
tells us how far the ball has moved from its starting position,
$p(0)$, after $t$ seconds.  Our goal is to use Galileo's discovery
that $g=9.8\frac{m}{s^2}$ to find a formula for $p(t)$.

During an (infinitesimal) instant of time $\dx{t}$, the velocity is
virtually constant so during that instant of time, $\dx{t}$, the
infinitesimal change in position, $\dx{p}$ is given by
$$\dx{p}=\text{velocity }\times\text{ change in time} =v\dx{t}.$$
But from Equation~(\ref{eq:Velocity}) we also know that $v=9.8t$, so
$ \dx{p}=9.8t\dx{t}$.

\pagebreak[4]

\begin{embeddedproblem}
\label{problem:PositionVelocityAcceleration}
Thus finding the position of the ball at any
time reduces to finding an expression for $p(t)$ that satisfies the
differential equation
<me>

\dx{p}=9.8t\dx{t}.
\label{eq:GalileoDiffeq}

</me>


\begin{wrapfigure}[]{r}{2in}
  \captionsetup{labelformat=empty}
  \centerline{\includegraphics*[height=3in,width=2in]{../Figures/Pisa1}}
  \label{fig:Pisa1}
\end{wrapfigure}
We begin with an educated guess.  From the Power Rule the differential of
a quadratic expression like $k t^2$ will be the linear term
$2k t\dx{t}$, so $p(t)=k t^2$ seems like a reasonable guess.
    \begin{enumerate}[label={  (\alph*)}]
\vskip-5mm 
    \item Show that $p(t)=kt^2$ satisfies 
      Equation~(\ref{eq:GalileoDiffeq}) when $$k=4.9=\frac{g}{2}.$$
    \item Earlier we reasoned that a ball dropped from a height of
      $9.8$ meters would strike the ground  between one and two
      seconds after being dropped. Use $p(t)$ to find out exactly how long it takes.
    \item How long would it take the ball to hit the ground if dropped
      from the top of the Tower of Pisa (a height of $56$ meters?
    \item Evaluate $\eval{\dfdx{p}{t}}{p}{56}$. What does this represent
      physically? \\\hint{Remember that $\dx{p}$ is a change in position
        and $\dx{t}$ is a change in time.}
    \end{enumerate}
  \end{embeddedproblem}



  To summarize the results of
  Problem~\#\ref{problem:PositionVelocityAcceleration} we see that if
  $p = p(t)=\frac{g}{2}t^2$ denotes the position of a dropped ball at
  time $t$, the following statements are true.
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item  The velocity of the ball is given by $v  =\dfdx{p}{t}(=gt)$, 
  \item The rate of change of the  velocity (acceleration)
    is then.
  <me>

    \label{eq:AccelerationAsSecondDerivative}
    \dfdx{v}{t}=\dfdx{\left(\dfdx{p}{t}\right)}{t}=g.

</me>
  \end{enumerate}

  Notice that in our diagram we also introduced
  the variable $h$ which represents the height of the ball from the
  ground. The way we choose to define our variables can have a
  considerable impact on the way we understand a given problem. Here
  for example both $p$ and $h$ give us the position of the ball but
  if $p(t)=4.9t^2$, then $p=0$ represents the top of the tower and the
  positive direction is down. Conversely, if  $h(t)=56-4.9t^2$, then $h=0$
  represents ground level and the positive direction is up.

  Our examination of Galileo's work affords us the opportunity to
  broaden our understanding of the meaning and use of differentials
  and differential notation.  In
  Problem~\#\ref{problem:PositionVelocityAcceleration} we used $p(t)$
  to represent the distance that the ball has fallen at time $t$. In
  that case it turned out that $\dfdx{p}{t}$ represents the velocity
  with which the ball is falling at time $t$. This is at once mundane
  and profound.

  It is mundane because velocity has always been defined as distance
  ($\dx{p}$) divided by elapsed time ($\dx{t}$), and this remains true
  even when the distance and the time are infinitesimals.

  It is profound because the (instantaneous) velocity $v(t)$, of the
  ball is always some finite quantity, but we compute it using the
  quotient of two differentials, $\dfdx{p}{t}$ in this case.

  This \term{differential ratio} is a fundamental concept.  In general
  if some quantity, say $y$ is changing in time then $\dfdx{y}{t}$
  represents the (instantaneous) rate of change of $y$.
  
  In Problem~\#\ref{problem:PositionVelocityAcceleration} we saw that
  the velocity of the falling ball is also changing in time, just like
  its position.  Thus we can turn around and compute the instantaneous
  change in velocity (the acceleration) by computing the differential
  of the velocity $\dx{\left(\dfdx{p}{t}\right)}$, and dividing by
  $\dx{t}$, giving $\dfdx{\left(\dfdx{p}{t}\right)}{t}$. This very
  awkward notation is often abbreviated as $\dfdxn{p}{t}{2}$. Notice
  that the acceleration is the result of the following set of
  computational steps:
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item Differentiate $p$.
  \item Divide by $\dx{t}$.
  \item Differentiate $\dfdx{p}{t}$.
  \item Divide by $\dx{t}$ again.
  \end{enumerate}

  As you become more fluent with these computations you will
  inevitably begin to combine these steps. Your teacher probably
  already does. However, the computation of a differential ratio
  always involves finding the differential of some \emph{finite}
  quantity and then dividing by another differential. If your
  instructor computes a differential ratio and you don't see how it
  was done, ask them to show you each differentiation and division.

  If we read the  abbreviated notation $\dfdxn{p}{t}{2}$ literally it seems to suggest that
  $\dx^2p=\dx(\dx{p})$ is meaningful but it is not. The notion of
  taking the differential of a differential is fraught with logical
  difficulties which we will address in
  Chapter~\ref{chapt:whats-wrong-with}. For now we can avoid pitfalls
  by recognizing that the expression $\dfdxn{y}{x}{n}$ is the result
  of differentiating and dividing by $\dx{x}$ $n$ times. We will
  explore this bit further in the next section.
  \begin{embeddedproblem-enumerate}

    \item
      In  general the height of an object falling near the surface of
      the earth is given by \\

      \begin{enumerate}[label={  (\roman*)}]

        is $v_0$, and the acceleration is $=-9.8$.
      \item For simplicity, assume $h_0=0$.  How high will the ball go?
      \item Suppose we double our initial velocity.  Would the ball go
        twice as high?  Compare this to your guess in
        Problem~\#\ref{prob:TossedBall1}?
      \end{enumerate}
    \end{enumerate}
  \end{embeddedproblem-enumerate}
  
  Since the graph of $h(t)=h_0+v_0t-4.9t^2$ is a parabola it is tempting to
  conclude that we have shown that an object falling under the influence
  of gravity alone must be a parabola. But this not correct. We have
  consistently assumed that the ball is falling vertically so its flight
  path is a straight vertical line, not a parabola. The graph of $h(t)$
  is not the flight path of the ball.

    

\section{The Derivative}
\label{subsec:Derivative}
\markright{\sc The Derivative}
  \begin{wrapfigure}[18]{r}{2in}

\end{wrapfigure}
Differentials are helpful for learning and using the differentiation
rules, but otherwise they are not very useful. Moreover as we have
frequently pointed out, using differentials brings up certain logical
and philosophical questions (Like, ``What are they?'') that are
very difficult to address. When we come
back to these matters in
Chapter~\ref{chapt:whats-wrong-with} you'll see what we mean. For all
of these reasons and more the concept of differentials should be
regarded as a convenient fiction and nothing more.


On the other hand as we've just seen the \emph{ratio} of
differentials, $\dfdx{y}{x}$, is extremely useful as it can be used to represent
either the slope of a graph or the velocity of a moving object,
depending on the context. Moreover the differential ratio is an
ordinary real number.

Because of concerns regarding the validity of differentials,
mathematicians in the $18$th and $19$th centuries, had a strong
motivation to skip over the differential concept and jump immediately
to the more useful, and finite, differential ratio.

In his $1797$
work
\href{https://www.maa.org/press/periodicals/convergence/mathematical-treasure-lagrange-on-calculus}{\foreign{Th\'{e}orie
    des Fonctions Analytiques}} (\pubtitle{The Theory of Analytic
  Functions}),
\href{https://mathshistory.st-andrews.ac.uk/Biographies/Lagrange/}{Joseph
  Louis Lagrange} ($1736-1813$) attempted to make Calculus more
rigorous.  He even coined a new term for the differential
ratio. He called it the \foreign{fonction d\'{e}riv\'{e}e} (meaning a
function \emph{derived} from another function). He also replaced the
differential ratio $\dfdx{y}{x}$ with the more modern
\term{function} notation $y^\prime(x)$ (read ``$y$ prime of $x$'').

Lagrange's attempt to make Calculus rigorous was very clever, but
ultimately unsuccessful. Full rigor had to wait for another hundred
years, so we will not say much about Lagrange's efforts here.  But we
will adopt his terminology and his notation.

\begin{Digression}[Function Notation, and Prime Notation]
  \label{digress:VarConFun2}
The French phrase \foreign{fonction d\'{e}riv\'{e}e} has come into
English as ``derived function,'' the \term{derivative function}, or
(most commonly)  just the \term{derivative}.

  Suppose that $y=x^3$. It is clear that $y$ depends on
  $x$, so we denote this functional dependence with the notation
  $$
  y(x)=x^3.
  $$

  Lagrange called the differential ratio $\dfdx{y}{x}$, a
  \term{derived function}.
  The ``derived'' part seems clear enough. After all, if $y=x^3$
  them $\dfdx{y}{x}$ is obtained (derived) from $y$ as
  follows:
  \begin{align*}
    y\amp =x^3\\
    \dx{y}\amp =3x^2\dx{x}\\
    \dfdx{y}{x}\amp =3x^2.
  \end{align*}

  Since  $\dfdx{y}{x}$ depends on $3x^2$ as a
  function it would not be wrong  to denote this functional
  dependence as 
  $$
  \dfdx{y}{x}(x) = 3x^2
  $$
  but it would be awkward. Moreover, Lagrange was trying to get away
  from the use of differentials so instead he used
  $$
  y^\prime(x)=3x^2
  $$
  and called $y^\prime(x)$ the  \term{derivative} (derived function) of $y(x)$.

In some contexts Lagrange's prime notation has several advantages over
the differential notation we've been using. Over time it has become
the most common notation for the \term{derivative} in mathematics. But the
fact that it took over $100$ years to develop suggests that something
more than mere notation is in play here.

Our current task is to master the differentiation rules so we will
stick to Leibniz's differential notation as much as possible because
using multiple equivalent notations can be very confusing.  But there
will come a time when Lagrange's prime notation will be much more
convenient.  At that point we will casually use the two expressions
$\dfdx{y}{x}$ and $y^\prime(x)$ interchangeably and we will think of
them both as a function \emph{derived from} the function $y(x)$.

When we do this the differential notation we're currently emphasizing
will take on two distinct ``personalities.''  On the one hand
$\dfdx{y}{x}$ represents a ratio of the differentials $\dx{y}$, and
$\dx{x}$ which are distinct infinitesimal quantities. On the other hand
$\dfdx{y}{x}$ is the name of a function -- it is all one symbol. You
cannot detach the pieces of $\dfdx{y}{x}$ any more than you can delete
the letter ``n'' from $\sin(x)$ because si$(x)$ has no meaning.

Eventually the differentials we've been using so casually will become
a guilty secret. Given $y=y(x)$ we'll use them as a helpful aid while
we \emph{compute}. But as soon as we have $\dfdx{y}{x}$ in hand we
will view it as a single, complete symbol representing the (finite)
derivative function. Often we will simply replace it with
$y^\prime(x)$ as if we are ashamed of having used differentials at
all.

This more advanced viewpoint will become commonplace later,
but to give you a preview, consider the following problem.

\begin{embeddedproblem}[Hudde's Rule:]
  \label{problem:HuddesRule}
  Recall that in Descartes' Method of Normals, we had to find a double
root of a polynomial.  To deal with this problem,
\href{https://mathshistory.st-andrews.ac.uk/Biographies/Hudde/}{Johann
  van Waveren Hudde} ($1628$-$1704$) developed an algebraic tool for
determining such double roots.  Calculus
allows a development of Hudde's Rule that does not require the complex
algebraic reasoning that Hudde used and is much easier
to follow\aside{Actually Hudde did considerably more than this. His
  method for finding double roots was a part of what has been called
  the ``Lost Calculus'' of algebraic functions. If you are interested
  you can read more about this in Jeff Suzuki's award winning article
  \pubtitle{\href{https://www.maa.org/sites/default/files/pdf/upload_library/22/Allendoerfer/suzuki339.pdf}{The
      Lost Calculus (1637-1670): Tangency and Optimization without
      Limits}}}.

  Consider any polynomial
    $p(x)=a_0+a_1 x+\cdots+a_n x^n$. Let $a$ and $b$ be any real
    numbers and form the following ``Hudde Polynomial.''
    $$
H\left (x \right ) =a {a} _ {0} + \left (a+b \right ) {a} _
    {1} x+ \left (a+2b \right ) {a} _ {2} {x} ^ {2} + \left (a+3b \right
    ) {a} _ {3} {x} ^ {3} +\ldots+ \left (a+nb \right ) {a} _ {n} {x} ^
    {n}
    $$
    Hudde showed that if $r$ is a double root of $p(x)$, then $r$ is a root of the Hudde
    polynomial $H(x).$
            \begin{enumerate}[label={  (\alph*)}] 
    \item Show that if $r$ is a double root of the polynomial $p(x)$
      then it is a root of $p^\prime(x)=\dfdx{p}{x}$.  \hint{If $r$ is a
        double root of $p(x)$, then $p(x) = (x-r)^2q(x)$ for some
        polynomial $q(x)$.}
    \item Show that $H(x) = ap(x)+bxp^\prime(x)$ and use this to prove
      Hudde's Rule.
    \end{enumerate}
  \end{embeddedproblem}
  \end{Digression}

  The bottom line is that we will adopt the name \term{derivative} to
  indicate the result of  dividing one differential by another. So the
  expression $\dfdx{y}{x}$ is ``the derivative of $y$ with respect to
  $x$.''

  When computing a derivative you will eventually become sufficiently
  proficient that you will jump directly to the derivatives. But for
  now we urge you to go through the two-step process of
  differentiating to obtain a differential and then dividing by
  another differential to obtain a derivative because the
  computational rules you've learned are differentiation rules, not
  derivative rules.  If you do this, you will avoid some difficulties
  created by trying compute too much too soon. This can be illustrated
  in the following example, where we purposely use prime notation to
  highlight the difficulties involved in the computation.

  \begin{myexample}
    \label{example:DerivVSDiff}
    Given $y(x)=(1+x^2)^\frac12$ we wish to compute
    $y\prime(x)$. Setting $z=1+x^2$ we see that
$$
y(x)=z^\frac12.
      $$ By the Power Rule we have
      <me>

        \label{eq:PrimeVSDiff}
        y^\prime(x)=\frac12z^{-\frac12}.
    
</me>
      This would seem to be correct but it is not. Do you see the
      problem?

      The left side of equation~(\ref{eq:PrimeVSDiff}) indicates that
      the variable is $x$ but there is no $x$ on the right side, only
      $z$. So this can't be right. But what went wrong?

      We can  avoid problems like this by using differentials: 
      <me>

        \label{eq:PrimeVSDiff2}
        \dx{y}=\frac12z^{-\frac12}\dx{z}.
    
</me>
      At this point if we divide by $\dx{z}$ we recover
      equation~(\ref{eq:PrimeVSDiff} in the form:
      $$
      \dfdx{y}{z}=\frac12z^{-\frac12}.
      $$
      Thus we see  the left side of
      equation~(\ref{eq:PrimeVSDiff}) should have been $y^\prime(z)$
      not  $y^\prime(x)$.

      \begin{ProficiencyDrill}
        Starting with equation~(\ref{eq:PrimeVSDiff}) complete the
        computation of $y^\prime(x)$.
      \end{ProficiencyDrill}
          \end{myexample}
  
                      








  \begin{myexample}
    Of course, using differentials does not address all of the
    difficulties.

    For example,
    let $y= x^3$. Then
  $$
  \dx{y}= \dx{(x^3)}= 3x^2\dx{x}
  \left(\text{First Derivative:}\dfdx{y}{x}=3x^2\right)
  $$
  So far, so good. Next we apply the Product Rule,\aside{To see
    why $\dx{(\dx{x})}=0$ we need to know that Leibniz always
    considered the differential $\dx{x}$ to be a constant. And the
    differential of any constant is zero, by the Constant Rule.}
$$
    \dx{(\dx{y})}= \dx(3x^2\dx{x}) = 3x^2\underbrace{\dx{(\dx{x})}}_{=0} +
    6x\dx{x}\dx{x}
$$
  so
  <me>

    \dx{(\dx{y})} =    6x\dx{x}\dx{x} \left(\text{Second Derivative: }\frac{\d(\d{y})}{\d{x}\d{x}}=6x=\dfdxn{y}{x}{2}.\right)
    \label{eq:PRNotation} 
  
</me>

  The glaring question here is why is $\dx(\dx{x})$ equal to zero but
  $\dx(\dx{y})$ is not equal to zero? Or, at a more fundamental level,
  what do we mean by ``the infinitely small change of an infinitely
  small change?'' As we will see in
  Chapter~\ref{chapt:whats-wrong-with} the early critics of Calculus
  cited this question specifically to argue that Calculus was invalid.

  We will address these issues beginning in
  Chapter~\ref{chapt:whats-wrong-with}. For now we will make the
  following compromise: We will only differentiate finite quantities,
  be they functions, or derivatives.  Since our ultimate goal is to
  compute some derivative
  this will suit our needs without getting
  caught up in the very problematic question of the nature of higher
  order differentials.  So for this example we have
  \begin{align*}
    y\amp =x^3\\
    \dx{y}\amp =3x^2\dx{x}\\

\begin{myexample}
  \label{example:HighOrderDerivs} 
  Consider the expression $y=\frac1x =x^{-1}$. Differentiating we have
  \begin{align*}
    \dfdx{y}{x}\amp =(-1)x^{-2},\\
  \dfdxn{y}{x}{2} \amp = (-1)(-2)x^{-3},\\
    \dfdxn{y}{x}{3} \amp = (-1)(-2)(-3)x^{-4},\\
    \intertext{and finally}
    \dfdxn{y}{x}{4} \amp = (-1)(-2)(-3)(-4)x^{-5}
  \end{align*}
  You've probably been taught all of your life to ``simplify'' complex
  looking expressions like $(-1)(-2)(-3)(-4)$ and  you
  probably do it  without thinking. So you may be wondering why
  we left the coefficients above in the form we did.

The reason is simple. We were looking for patterns not numbers.
Writing the above formulas as $\dfdxn{y}{x}{2} = 2x^{-3},$
$\dfdxn{y}{x}{3} = -6x^{-4}$, and $\dfdxn{y}{x}{4} = 24x^{-5}$ 
 obscures the pattern.
Keep this in mind as you proceed.  Algebraic or arithmetical
``simplifications'' often  get in the way of recognizing patterns. Don't do them until
there is a compelling reason to.

Adopting Lagrange's terminology, but not his notation, we see that if
the position of a point moving in a straight line (like the $x$ axis)
is given by $x=x(t)$, then the first derivative, $\dfdx{x}{t}$, will
give its velocity, and its second derivative, $\dfdxn{x}{t}{2}$, will
give its acceleration.

\section{Thinking Dynamically}
\label{sec:newt-flux-dynam}
\markright{\sc The Dynamic Approach}

If $s(t)$ represents the position of an object moving in a straight
line we have seen that its velocity is given by $\dfdx{s}{t}$. When
the object is falling vertically we will use $y(t)$ to represent its
vertical position, so that $\dfdx{y}{t}$ is its vertical
velocity. Similarly if it is moving horizontally we will use $x(t)$
and $\dfdx{x}{t}$.



\begin{wrapfigure}[12]{r}{1.in}
  \vskip-6mm 
  \captionsetup{labelformat=empty}
  \centerline{\includegraphics*[height=1.6in,width=1.2in]{../Figures/Helicopter3}}
  \label{fig:Helicopter3}
\end{wrapfigure}
Recall that in
Problem~\ref{problem:HelicopterFall} we imagined releasing an object from
a helicopter which is flying horizontally horizontally
with a speed of $\dfdx{x}{t}=1\frac{\text{meter}}{\text{second}}$.
From Galileo's work we now know that its vertical velocity will be
$\dfdx{y}{t}=9.8 t\, \frac{\text{meters}}{\text{second}}$.

After its release the ball will fall neither horizontally, nor
vertically. It won't even fall along a straight line. If we ignore air
resistance then combination of the ball's horizontal velocity
(inherited from the helicopter) and its vertical velocity (due to the
force of gravity) will cause the flight path, $s(t)$, to curve into an
arc similar to that shown in the figure at the right.

\begin{ProficiencyDrill}
  Since $\dfdx{x}{t}=1$ we have $x=t$. Since  $\dfdx{y}{t}=-9.8t$ and we know that $y=-4.9t^2.$ Use this to find a formula
  for $y=y(x)$ and confirm that the arc is a parabola.
\end{ProficiencyDrill}

As the ball falls there are three distinct quantities we are
interested in: the horizontal velocity of the ball, $\dfdx{x}{t}$, the vertical
velocity of the ball, $\dfdx{y}{t}$, and its speed in the direction of travel.


We'd like to find the \emph{speed} of the object in the direction it
is moving.  Referring to the differential triangle in our sketch it is
clear that this will be\aside{The absolute value bars here are
  correct.  This has more to do with our vocabulary (speed
  vs. velocity) than with this physical problem. In general speed is
  always a positive number, while velocity can be negative or
  positive. We will discuss this in more depth in
  Chapter~\ref{cha:calc-trig}.} $\abs{\dfdx{s}{t}}$.  But how do we
find $\dfdx{s}{t}$?

Since $\dx{x}$ and $\dx{y}$ are perpendicular (they are displacements
in the horizontal and vertical directions, respectively)  by
the Pythagorean Theorem  we have
$$
(\dx{s})^2=(\dx{x})^2+(\dx{y})^2.
$$
Thus the displacement of $s(t)$, in the direction of travel is
$$
\abs{\dx{s}}=\sqrt{(\dx{x})^2+(\dx{y})^2}.
$$
Dividing by $\abs{\dx{t}}$ we see that the speed in the direction of travel
at any time $t$ is
\begin{align*}
  \abs{\dfdx{s}{t}}\amp =\frac{\sqrt{(\dx{x})^2+(\dx{y})^2}}{\dx{t}}\\
                   \amp =\sqrt{\left(\dfdx{x}{t}\right)^2+\left(\dfdx{y}{t}\right)^2}\\
                   \amp = \sqrt{1+(9.8t)^2}.
\end{align*}

Recall that we stopped analyzing in Problem~\ref{problem:FlightPath1}
because we needed  to be able to account for both the velocity and the
acceleration of the craft. We now have everything we need to finish
the analysis of the flight path of the commercial airliner which we
started in Example~\#\ref{example:FlightPath}.

\begin{embeddedproblem}
  \label{problem:AirlinerSpeed}
  \begin{wrapfigure}[]{r}{2.4in}

    \centerline{\includegraphics*[height=1.2in,width=2.4in]{../Figures/Descent2}}
    \label{fig:Descent2}
  \end{wrapfigure}
  Recall that in Problem~\ref{problem:FlightPath1} we asked  you find the
  equation of this flight path from the data in
  the figure at the
  right.
  You should have found that
  $$
  y=\frac{-2h}{l^3}x^3+\frac{3h}{l^2}x^2.
  $$
  As we said when we suspended our earlier efforts, the problem with
  this picture is that it is static. It is a picture of the path the
  airliner has flown after the flight is finished.  We now have the
  tools we need to address the characteristics of the flight as it
  occurs.

            \begin{enumerate}[label={  (\alph*)}]
                          \item Use the differential triangle in our figure to show that
    airspeed of the airplane in its direction of motion,
    $\abs{\dfdx{s}{t}}$, its horizontal velocity, $\dfdx{x}{t}$, and
    slope of its flight path, $\dfdx{y}{x}$, are related by the
    formula:\\
    <me>

      \label{eq:Descent2}

    \hint{Recall that $\dfdx{x}{t}$, and $\dfdx{y}{t}$ are the
      horizontal and vertical velocities respectively}
  \item Assume that the plane's horizontal velocity is constant.
    \begin{enumerate}[label={  (\roman*)}] 
          \item Use Equation~(\ref{eq:Descent2}) to explain how we know that
      the plane is traveling fastest when it is at the point where
      the curve is steepest (about where the red dot is in our
      sketch\aside{It is possible to find the numerical coordinates of
        this point
        but it is rather difficult to see how to proceed at this
        point. It is worth taking a few minutes  to ponder how this
        might be done.}).
    \item What is the slowest speed attained by the plane, and  where
      on the flight path does this occcur?      
          \end{enumerate}
  \end{enumerate}
\end{embeddedproblem}



\begin{ProficiencyDrill}
  Suppose  $(x,y)$ are  the coordinates of a ball moving

  the following.

 The next problem will complete our analysis of the flight path
 of our commercial airliner.


\begin{embeddedproblem}
  The flight path  obtained in Problem~\#\ref{problem:FlightPath1}
  was $ y=\frac{-2h}{l^3}x^3+\frac{3h}{l^2}x^2 $.
  We need to put some limitations on the vertical acceleration,
  $\dfdxn{y}{t}{2}$, experienced by the passengers in a commercial
  airliner. For simplicity assume that the pilot must maintain a
  constant horizontal speed of $v\frac{\text{
      meters}}{\text{second}}$. (That is, set  $\dfdx{x}{t}=-v$.)
  \begin{enumerate}[label={  (\alph*)}]
  \item Use the above equation to show that the vertical acceleration
    is given by
    $$ \dfdxn{y}{t}{2}=\frac{6hv^2}{l^2}\left(1-\frac{2x}{l}\right).$$
  \item On the interval $0\le x\le l$, what is the largest vertical
    acceleration and what is the smallest vertical acceleration and
    where do they occur?  Does this make sense physically?
  \item Suppose we put a restriction on the vertical acceleration so that
    $$
    -k\frac{\text{ meters}}{\text{second}^2}\le\dfdxn{y}{t}{2}\le k\frac{\text{ meters}}{\text{second}^2}
    $$
    for some constant $k$.  Show that with this restriction,
    $
    l\ge\sqrt{\frac{6Hv^2}{k}}
    $.
  \item Suppose that initially $h=10000$ meters, $v=100\frac{\text{
        meters}}{\text{second}}$,
    $k=0.1\frac{\text{ meters}}{\text{sec}^2}$ (which is approximately $1\%$ of
    the acceleration due to gravity).  Find what $l$ must be (in
    kilometers).% \\
          \end{enumerate}
\end{embeddedproblem}




In Section~\ref{sec:vomit-comet} we mentioned that NASA claims that
the Vomit Comet can make passengers experience weightlessness for
about $25$ seconds.  Let's check on that claim.


To simulate weightlessness (neutral buoyancy) the pilot must
execute a parabolic flight path $y=Ax^2+Bx+C$. In
Problem~\#\ref{problem:FlightPath2} you should have found that $B$
and $C$ were $1$ and $7000$, respectively, so the flight path is
<me>

  \label{eq:ParFlightPath}
  y=Ax^2+x+7000

</me>
with $A$ yet to be determined.


The pilot is climbing at angle of elevations $45^\circ$ to an altitude
of about $7000$ meters and then follows this parabolic path to produce
a vertical acceleration of $\dfdxn{y}{t}{2}=-9.8\,\frac{m}{s^2}$
(matching the acceleration due to gravity) and horizontal acceleration
of $\dfdxn{x}{t}{2}=0$. This will provide neutral buoyancy inside the
plane.  On the way back down the pilot pulls out of this dive when the
altitude returns to $7000$ meters.

For training purposes this is repeated $40$ times.


\begin{embeddedproblem-enumerate}
  \begin{enumerate}[label={  (\alph*)}]
          \item To determine $A$ we need one more fact.  At the beginning of
    the maneuver, the initial airspeed is about $180\frac{\text{ meters}}{\text{second}}$
    (approximately $400$ mph).  Use the initial airspeed to determine
    $\dfdx{x}{t}$. In turn use this result and the fact that $\dfdxn{y}{t}{2}=-9.8$ to
    show that $A=-\frac{9.8}{180^2}\approx -0.0003$.\\
    \comment{Notice that you are not asked to find $A$. The problem is
    to show that the value we've given is correct.}
  \item Now that we've determined all of the coefficients,
    Equation~\ref{eq:ParFlightPath} describes the flight path of the
    Vomit Comet. Use Equation~\ref{eq:ParFlightPath}  to determine
    the value of $x$  when the pilot pulls out of the dive at $7000$
    meters.
  \item Next find the value of  $t$ when the pilot pulls out of the
    dive. How does this compare with the $25$ second claim?\\
    \hint{You may find it helpful to review, part (b) of
      Problem~\#\ref{problem:GeneralFallingBalls}.}
  \item If the pilot wants to maintain a constant horizontal speed
    what must the airspeed of the plane be in terms of $t$ ($t=0$
    representing the start of the maneuver)?
  \end{enumerate}

\section{Newton's Method of Fluxions}
\label{sec:newt-meth-flux}
\mycenterquote{The method of Fluxions is the general key by help
  whereof the modern mathematicians unlock the secrets of Geometry, and
consequently of
Nature.}{\href{https://mathshistory.st-andrews.ac.uk/Biographies/Berkeley/}{George

the surface of the earth. At about the same time
\href{https://mathshistory.st-andrews.ac.uk/Biographies/Kepler/}{Johannes
  Kepler} ($1571-1630$) had accurately described the motion of the
planets by analyzing the vast catalog of astronomical observation made
by
\href{https://mathshistory.st-andrews.ac.uk/Biographies/Brahe/}{Tycho
  Brahe} ($1546-1601$).  But these two descriptions of motion did not
appear to be related.

It was left to Newton to unify them, but the mathematics for this did
not exist at the time. So he invented Calculus, which he called
\pubtitle{\href{https://www.maa.org/press/periodicals/convergence/mathematical-treasure-newtons-method-of-fluxions}{The
    Method of Fluxions}}.  Galileo studied motion on the surface of
the Earth.  Kepler studied the motion of the planets, but the
underlying theme for both was motion.

\begin{wrapfigure}[14]{r}{3in}
  \vskip-4mm 
\captionsetup{labelformat=empty}
\includegraphics*[height=2.25in,width=3in]{../Figures/BraheKepler}
\label{fig:Kepler}
\end{wrapfigure}
Through experimentation Galileo had accurately described the motion of
falling objects near 


For Newton everything was in motion.  When he used the variable $x$ he
thought of it as representing something ``flowing in time''
(moving). Such quantities he called \term{fluents}, from
\foreign{fluere}, the Latin word which means ``to flow.''  As he put
it himself in his book
\href {https://www.maa.org/press/periodicals/convergence/mathematical-treasure-newton-on-quadrature-of-curves}{\foreign{Quadratura
    Curvarum}} (On the Quadrature of Curves),
\emph{    I sought a method of determining quantities from the velocities
    of the motions or [of the] increments, with which they are
    generated; and calling these velocities of the motions, or [of
    the] increments, \emph{fluxions}, and generated quantities
    \emph{fluents}, I fell by degrees, in the years $1665$ and
    $1666$, upon the method of fluxions, which I have made use of
    here in the quadrature of curves.}


  For a given fluent $x$, Newton used the ``dotted letter,''
  $\dot{x}$, to refer to its \emph{instantaneous velocity} or
  \term{fluxion}. Whereas for Leibniz the static differential was the
  fundamental concept, for Newton the dynamic fluxion (velocity) was
  fundamental.  On the surface fluxions seem quite different from
  differentials.

In Newton's view the only independent variable is time. So all
fluxions were velocities, or rates of change with respect to time. To
see how fluxions are connected to the differential ratios we've been
using,  we need only ask ourselves how Leibniz would express the
fluxion, $\dot{x}$, of the fluent, $x$. In Leibniz' notation the rate
of change of $x$ \emph{with respect to} $t$ is the differential ratio
$\dfdx{x}{t}$.  Since Newton \emph{defines} $\dot{x}$ to be the rate
of change of $x$ with respect to ($t$)ime (velocity),
$$
\dot{x} = \dfdx{x}{t}.
$$



From Newton's point of view differentiating the spatial coordinate $y$
with respect to the spatial coordinate $x$ to get $\dfdx{y}{x}$ is
simply not meaningful.  On the
other hand, if $P=(x,y)$ is a point moving along some curve in the
plane then both $x$ and $y$ are fluents with corresponding fluxions
$\dot{y}$ and $\dot{x}$.

What Leibniz's notation expresses as
$\dfdx{y}{x}$ Newton's notation expresses as
$\frac{\dot{y}}{\dot{x}}$. But they are the same thing.
since
$$
\frac{\dot{y}}{\dot{x}} = \frac{\dfdx{y}{t}}{\dfdx{x}{t}}=
\frac{\dx{y}}{\cancel{\dx{t}}}\frac{\cancel{\dx{t}}}{\dx{x}}=\dfdx{y}{x}.
$$

                            
Although the two formulations are equivalent Leibniz' notation has
become dominant in mathematics. But  in fields where velocity is a
fundamental concept, like physics and engineering, Newton's dot
notation is often still used. 
For example, suppose we are considering a point $P$ on the curve
$y=x^2$ and we want
the slope of the curve at $P$.  Using our
differentiation rules, we have
$$
\dx{y}=2x\dx{x}.
$$
To get the slope, we divide by $d{x}$ to get
$$
\dfdx{y}{x}=2x.
$$

Using his Method of Fluxions, Newton would have considered both $x$
and $y$ to be fluents and $P=(x,y)$ to be a point moving along a
curve.  His version of Calculus would have started with the same
governing equation $y=x^2$ and determined that their fluxions were
related by the equation
$$
\dot{y}=2x\dot{x}.
$$

To get the slope of the curve $y=x^2$, we simply  need to recognize
that this is the same as
$$\frac{\dot{y}}{\dot{x}}=2x=\frac{\dfdx{y}{t}}{\dfdx{x}{t}}=\dfdx{y}{x}.$$


Although Newton's dot notation has fallen out of favor in
mathematics you
will likely see it being used in your physics or engineering courses
(if you take any). We would be remiss if we failed to recognize this
fact. 
So when appropriate, we will sometimes couch our problems in the 
dynamical language and dot notation of Newton. We will even
sometimes refer to the derivatives $\dfdx{y}{t}$, or $\dfdx{x}{t}$ as
fluxions. After all when  $t$
represents time that's what they are. Only the notation has changed.

If you prefer the Leibnizian terms and notation it is easy to
translate between Newton and Leibniz. If $x$ is changing in time then
$\dot{x}=\dfdx{x}{t}$ is the fluxion of $x$.

    Let's check your guess.  The general approach is to find the
    relationships between all of the fluents involved then
    differentiate and divide by $\dx{t}$ to see how their fluxions are
    related.  Below we have redrawn the essential features of the
    problem schematically and labeled all of the fluents.\\
    \centerline{\includegraphics*[height=1.2in,width=3.5in]{../Figures/TetheredCarts}}

  We have the following relationships between the fluents:
  $$
  x^2+10^2=z^2,\hskip3 mm y^2+10^2=w^2,\text{ and } z+w=100.

  $\dfdx{x}{t} = 1 \frac{\text{ unit}}{\text{second}}$.\\

  \item 
   As an alternative approach, we re-label the diagram as follows:\\

 Define $ D=z+w.$ From  this diagram we have
    \begin{align*}

  \item 
    Differentiate each of these equations and use the results to
    show  that
    $$

Problem\#\ref{problem:snell1} demonstrates that you have alternatives
when solve any problem.  Consciously try to avoid getting locked in to
a single solution scheme.  One alternative is to try to determine a
single function of a single variable before differentiating.  At the
other extreme we can just assign variable names to all of the
important quantities in our problem and differentiate the equations
relating these variables.

The best approach will depend upon the problem. In fact, most of the
time you'll find yourself using a mixture of the two. Keep in mind
that it is always good to have alternatives.

\section{Self-intersecting Curves and Parametric Equations}
\label{sec:self-inters-curv}
In Problem~\#\ref{problem:ClassicalCurves1} we asked  you to find the line
tangent to several interesting curves.  However, we were careful to ask
only about relatively simple curves. In particular, none of the curves
in Problem~\#\ref{problem:ClassicalCurves1} intersected themselves. We
avoided self-intersecting curves earlier because we didn't have the
techniques necessary to address the problem of tangent lines at points
where a curve crosses itself. We do now.

But we need to broaden our thinking a bit.

\pagebreak[4]

\begin{ProficiencyDrill-enumerate}

      \item Locate all of the points $(x,y)\neq (0,0)$ where the line
        tangent to the Folium of Descartes is horizontal.
      \item Locate all of the points $(x,y)\neq (0,0)$ where the line
        tangent to the Folium of Descartes is  vertical.
      \end{enumerate}
    \item The Tschirnhausen cubic:
      $27{y}^{2}=\left(1-x\right){\left(8+x\right)}^{2}$\\\\
      \centerline{\includegraphics*[height=1.5in,width=3in]{../Figures/TschirnhausenCubic3}}
     \begin{enumerate}[label={  (\roman*)}]
            
    \item Show that $\dfdx{y}{x} = \frac{-(8+x)(3x+6)}{54y}.$
    \item Locate all of the points $(x,y)\neq (-8,0)$ where the line
      tangent to the Tschirnhausen cubic is horizontal.
    \item Locate all of the points $(x,y)\neq (-8,0)$ where the line
      tangent to the Tschirnhausen cubic is  vertical.
          \end{enumerate}
  \end{enumerate}
\end{ProficiencyDrill-enumerate}

If we try to compute $\eval{\dfdx{y}{x}}{(x,y)}{(0,0)}$ for the Folium
of Descartes we find that
$\eval{\dfdx{y}{x}}{(x,y)}{(0,0)}=\frac{0}{0}$ which is very strange.
We can see in the graph that at $(0,0)$ there is both a horizontal
and a vertical tangent line, so it seems to make some sort of
sense.

You might be thinking that we have stumbled upon a new rule about tangent
lines: If we ever obtain $\dfdx{y}{x}=\frac{0}{0}$, at some point then
the curve has both a vertical and horizontal tangent at that point.
It would be nice if things were that simple, but they aren't.

But now consider the Tschirnhausen Cubic at the self-intersection
point $(-8,0)$.  As long as we stay away from the self-intersection
point there are no difficulties. But from the graph we can see that
any sort of tangent line at the point of self-intersection would be
neither vertical nor horizontal despite the fact that once again we
have $$\eval{\dfdx{y}{x}}{(x,y)}{(-8,0)}=\frac{0}{0}.$$

If nothing else, these examples illustrate that using Calculus is much
more subtle than simply computing a derivative. A cavalier attitude
can lead to some very strange anomalies.  As is true of any powerful
tool, to avoid disaster we must be careful.

The safest approach is to avoid points of self-intersection and
fractions such as $\frac00$. But we won't be able to avoid them
forever so we might as well address the issue now.  Adopting Newton's
dynamic approach will give us the crucial insight.  Think of the
horizontal and vertical coordinates as Newton's fluents; things
changing in time.


Using the static approach to find a tangent line at a
self-intersection point is very much like standing in the center of
the intersection of two roads and trying to decide if the road goes
north-south or east-west. Obviously the road doesn't go anywhere. It
just sits there. Likewise, a curve is not dynamic. It just sits there,
like a road.

It is the travelers on the road and the point that traces a curve
which move.

If instead we ask, ``Which way are we going as we
  \emph{pass through the intersection}?'' there is only one answer. We're
going in the direction we were traveling when we entered the
intersection.  If we think about the situation dynamically rather than
statically, we always have both a position on the curve and a
direction we are traveling.

So if we adopt Newton's viewpoint and think of the curve as being
generated by the motion of a point things change.

If we are traveling along a curve our direction of travel is always
tangent to the curve. By changing our question from ``What is the
tangent line at this point?'' to ``What is the tangent line at this
time?'' the concept of two (or more) tangent lines at a single point
in space becomes meaningful. Each tangent is obtained by passing
through the point of tangency at distinct moments in time.

\begin{embeddedproblem}
  \label{problem:FoliumOfDescartes1}
  Recall that the Folium of Descartes, $x^3+y^3=3xy$,  crosses itself at the origin.
    \begin{enumerate}[label={  (\alph*)}]
  \item Show that if $ x(t)=\frac{3t}{1+t^3}$ and

  \item For which values of $t$ is $y\ge0$?
  \item Find the value of $t$ for which $(x(t), y(t)) = (0,0)$. use
    the result of part (b) to  compute
    $\dfdx{y}{x}=\frac{\dot{y}}{\dot{x}}$ at this time. Is
    this consistent with the graph?
  \item Can you explain why we only found one tangent line at $(0,0)$
    when it is quite clear from the graph that there must be two?
  \end{enumerate}
\end{embeddedproblem}

What comes along with this change in interpretation is this: We no
longer want to think of a differential ratio \emph{only} as a
slope.  If $y$ and $x$ happen to represent the vertical
and horizontal coordinates of a graph, then the change of $y$ with
respect to $x$, $\dfdx{y}{x}$, will be the slope of the curve
$y=y(x)$. 

If $y$ represents the vertical position of an object and $t$
represents the time when the object is at position $y(t)$, then the
change of $y$ with respect to $t$, $\dfdx{y}{t}=\dot{y}$, is the
vertical velocity of the object as it passes through $y$.  Likewise,
if $x(t)$ represents the horizontal position of an object then
$\dfdx{x}{t}=\dot{x}$ is the horizontal velocity of the object as it
passes through $x$.

In general, if $\alpha$ and $\beta$ are two related quantities  then
$\dfdx{\alpha}{\beta}$ is the \term{rate of change of $\alpha$ with respect to
  $\beta$.} The physical (or geometric) interpretation of
$\dfdx{\alpha}{\beta}$ will necessarily depend on what $\alpha$ and
$\beta$ represent physically (or geometrically).

\subsection*{Parametric Functions}
When we switched to Newton's dynamical viewpoint, we changed the nature of
our representations of the curves. For example the Folium of Descartes
can be represented by the formula as
$$x^3+y^3=3xy.$$
This formula is complex and can be hard to work with, mainly because
the relationship between $x$ and $y$ is difficult to see and understand.

In the representation
$$
  x(t)=\frac{3t}{1+t^3}, \ \  \  
  y(t)=\frac{3t^2}{1+t^3}
  $$
  the relationship between $x$ and $y$ is still difficult but since
  $x(t)$ and $y(t)$ are both functions the relationship between $x$
  and $t$ and between $y$ and $t$ is a bit simpler. We know how to
  work with functions.
    
This second representation is usually called the \term{parametric
  functions} or \term{parametric equation} representation, because the
$x$ and $y$ coordinates are given in terms of a parameter. In this
case the parameter $t$ represents time. This is common but by no means
required. The parameter might represent anything, just as any variable 
might.

In fact, you might be wondering where we got the parameterization for
the Folium.  It may not seem obvious, but as long as $(x,y)\neq(0,0)$, the
parameter $t$ actually represents the slope of the line joining the
origin to the point $(x,y)$ on the Folium.


\begin{embeddedproblem}
  Let $(x,y)$ represent any point on the Folium $x^3+y^3=3xy$ which is
  not the origin.  Let $t$ represent the slope of the line joining the
  origin to $(x,y)$; that is, $\frac{y}{x}=t$ or $y=tx$.  Use this to
  show\aside{The difference between this problem and
  Problem~\ref{problem:FoliumOfDescartes1} is this: In
  Problem~\ref{problem:FoliumOfDescartes1} we gave you $x(t)$ and
  $y(t)$ and asked you to show that it satisfies the equation of the
  Folium. Here we start with the equation of the Folium and you need
  to find $x(t)$ and $y(t)$. } that
  $$
  x=\frac{3t}{1+t^3},\text{ and } y=\frac{3t^2}{1+t^3}.
  $$
  \end{embeddedproblem}
  Of course, it is not wrong to also think of this parameter as time.
  We are just stipulating that the point is moving so that its
  position at time $t$ is such that the slope of the line joining the
  origin to the point matches $t$.  Mathematically, what the parameter
  represents is usually not at issue. It is just a parameter.


    Recall that when we looked at Roberval's treatment of the conic
    sections in Section~\ref{sec:roberv-conic-sect} we found it handy
    to think of our curves as being traced out by the motion of a
    point and we created the notation
    $
    \begin{ParamEq}
      {x(t)}{y(t)} 
    \end{ParamEq}
    $ to reflect that point of view. With one slight modification this notation suits our current
    needs as well.

    First, since the coordinates of our point are, individually,
    functions of $t$ it follows that the position of the point $P$
    itself depends on (is a function of) $t$ as well:
    $$P(t)= 
    \begin{ParamEq}
      {x(t)}{y(t)} .
    \end{ParamEq}
    $$ 

    Second, it is useful for us to have a convenient way to specify
    the domain of the function. So we add a third component to do
    that. For example, if the domain of our function is all
    values of $t$ strictly between zero and one we would write.
    $$
    P(t)=
    \begin{ParamEq}
      {x(t)}{y(t)}{0\lt t\lt1}.
    \end{ParamEq}

``static'' are only words we use to describe the way we're thinking
about a problem. There is nothing inherently dynamic or static in either representation
so there is no \foreign{a priori} reason to prefer one over the
other. They describe the same set of points in the plane. 

For example if $y=x^2$ then $\dx{y}=2x\dx{x}$. Time ($t$) does not
appear in these formulas so we tend to think of them
statically. However if we want to think of them dynamically we divide
by $\dx{t}$ to get $\dfdx{y}{t}=2x\dfdx{x}{t}$ and interpret this to
say that at any given time $t$, the position of a point is
$
\begin{ParamEq}
  {x(t)}
{y(t)}
 
\end{ParamEq}
$ and the vertical velocity, $\dfdx{y}{t}$ is twice the
value of the $x$ coordinate times the horizontal velocity,
$\dfdx{x}{t}$.

\begin{myexample}
  Moving between the equation and parametric forms can be very hard to
  do depending on the complexity of the equation.  The simplest
  situation is when you have $y$ as a function of $x$; for example
  $y(x)=x^2$. To find a parametric representation we observe that we
  need to specify both $x$ and $y$ as functions of a third parameter,
  $t$. This can be puzzling until we realize that $x$ is completely
  free. All we need to do is ensure that $y=x^2$.  So if we take
  $x(t)=t$ and $y=x^2=t^2$ we \emph{almost} have our
  parameterization.
  
  When faced with a formula like $y=x^2$ you have learned to always
  assume that $x$ could be any real number that makes sense in the
  formula. But with parametric equations this assumption can lead to
  problems. We'll need to specify the allowable values of the
  parameter $t$ explicitly. This is why we said we \emph{almost} have
  our parameterization. A complete parameterization must specify the
  values of $t$ that are available to us, so in this case
  $$ P(t)= \begin{ParamEq} { x(t)= t} { y(t)= t^2} {
      -\infty\lt t\lt \infty}.
  \end{ParamEq}
  $$

  We can \emph{always} parameterize the graph of a function the same
  way we just parameterized $y=x^2$. A parameterization of $y=y(x)$,
  with domain $a\le x\le b$ is
$$
P(t)=
\begin{ParamEq}
{  x(t)=t}
{  y(t)=y(t)}
{  t\in [a,b]}
\end{ParamEq}.
$$

This parameterization is  equivalent to working with the function
$y=y(x)$ so it may or may not be particularly useful, but
it can always be done.

As we've seen we can always parameterize the graph of a function, but
the reverse is not true.  A parameterized curve will not always be the
graph of some function.  For example the curves in
Problem~\#\ref{problem:ClassicalCurves1} are not  graphs of  functions,
but all of these curves can be parameterized.

Because  it can't always be accomplished there is no general strategy for
expressing a parameterized curve as the graph of a function. One
strategy that sometimes works\aside{Not necessarily the best.  In general there is no best
  way.} is to find $\dfdx{y}{x}$ and ``undifferentiate''  as in the
following example.

\section{Bridges, Chains, Domes, and Telescopes}
\label{sec:bridg-chains-telesc}
\markright{\sc Bridges, Chains, Domes, and Telescopes}

\subsection*{Bridges}


In the previous section all of the quantities we were looking at were
time dependent -- they were in motion -- so it was useful to think of
the derivative, $\dfdx{y}{t}$, as a velocity (fluxion). In other
applications, where the quantities involved are not time dependent,
the derivative is still a useful tool but thinking of it as a velocity
may not be as useful.

For example, consider the shape of the support cable on a stable
suspension bridge as seen in the picture below. % A \emph{stable} bridge
The shape of the suspension cable appears to be parabolic, but how can
we be sure of this?\\
\centerline{\includegraphics*[height=2.3in,width=4in]{../Figures/GoldenGatebyModestosUrbanos1.png}}

At any given moment there are a lot of forces acting on a bridge, but
most  are insignificant most of the time. The mantra of
mathematical modeling is to keep things as simple as possible (at
least in the beginning) by focusing on the dominant parameter
first\aside{Or, equivalently, we set the secondary parameters equal to
  zero.} In this case the dominant force involved is clearly
the weight of the bridge itself.

We assume that the weight density of the deck of the bridge is $W$
newtons/meter\aside{A \emph{newton} is a unit of force, named
  after Isaac Newton.}. The cable adds to the weight of the bridge as
well, but  it is relatively small compared to the weight of the
deck. So we will ignore it to keep the model simple.  Assuming the deck
is horizontal, we can take it to be the $x$ axis

Now suppose the graph of $y=y(x)$ represents the cable between two
upright towers located at $x=-U$ and $x=U.$ Remember, though we
suspect that $y(x)$ is a parabola we don't yet know if this
is true.\\\\
\centerline{\includegraphics*[height=1in,width=5in]{../Figures/Bridge1}}
We choose an arbitrary point $(x,y)$ on the curve with
$0\lt x\lt U$ and
focus on the portion of the bridge between $(-x,y)$ and $(x,y)$.\\\\
\centerline{\includegraphics*[height=1in,width=5in]{../Figures/Bridge2}}
These are the two points that are holding up the section of the bridge
on the interval from $-x$ to $x$.  The arrows represent the tangential
forces felt on the cable at the points.

We'll examine the the horizontal and vertical components of the
tangential force at various points on the bridge.\\
\centerline{\includegraphics*[height=1.7in,width=6in]{../Figures/Bridge6}}
Since the curve is symmetric, we only draw the half where $x\ge
0$.

Notice the tangential force at $x=0$, which we have labeled $-T$, is
horizontal. This reflects the fact that at that point the vertical
force would be the weight for the deck from $x=0$ to $x=0$ which is
zero\aside{This is why it’s the lowest point, there is no vertical
  pull.}. (You’ll see why we used negatives momentarily.)
Hence the tangential force is equal to the horizontal tension, $-H$.

As we move away from the center of the cable to some point $x_1$, there is more
of the deck to support. Since we are ignoring the weight of the cable,
the vertical force is equal to the weight of the deck from $x=0$ to
$x_1$ so the tangential tension gets larger as we move to the
right. The horizontal tension at every single point will be the same as
the tension at the origin. What varies is the vertical component of
the force. 



The cumulative effect can also be thought of this way. The point on
the cable at $x = 20$ meters must not only support the weight of the deck
from $x = 10$ meters to $x = 20$ meters, but must bear the brunt of the load at the
point $x = 10$ meters as well. This leads to the vertical force at $x
= 20$ meters
being $-10W \text{ newtons }- 10W \text{ newtons }= -20W$ newtons. The
point at $x = 30$ meters must support whatever
weight there is at $x = 20$ meters along with the extra weight from $x
= 20$ meters 
to $x = 30$ meters which totals $-20W \text{ newtons }- 10W \text{
  newtons }= -30W$ newtons. If you were hoisting a
person carrying a bucket of sand, then you would be bearing the weight
of both the person and the sand even though that person is only bearing
the weight of the sand. This is the same idea.

\begin{wrapfigure}[]{r}{2in}
  \vskip-8mm 
\captionsetup{labelformat=empty}
\centerline{\includegraphics*[height=1in,width=2in]{../Figures/Bridge7}}
\label{fig:Bridge7}
\end{wrapfigure}
The conclusion of this analysis is that at any point $(x, y)$ on the
curve, the tangential force pulling against the cable has a horizontal
component of $-H$ and a vertical component of $-Wx$. To stabilize the
bridge, we need the cable to be pulling with the same force in exactly
the opposite direction. This leads to the sketch at the right. (Now
you see why we used negatives before.)

\begin{embeddedproblem-enumerate}
  \begin{enumerate}[label={  (\alph*)}]
  \item Use the above analysis and schematic drawing of the forces
    involved to show that the curve  representing the cable must
    satisfy the differential equation
    $$\dfdx{y}{x}=\frac{Wx}{H}.$$
    \hint{Notice that $T$ is pulling in the direction tangent to the
      cable.}
  \item Show that the parabola $y=\frac{W}{2H} x^2+b,$ where $b$ is an
    arbitrary constant, satisfies this differential equation
  \item Let $W = 1$, $b = 0$ and plot the parabola for $H = 1, 2,
    3$. Does this agree with the idea that $H$ indicates how tightly we
    are winching the cable?
  \end{enumerate}
\end{embeddedproblem-enumerate}

With our simplifying assumptions in place it appears that  the cable on a
suspension bridge does indeed  hang in the shape of a parabola. But the
suspension bridge has to hold up the deck beneath it. After all,
that is its purpose.


\subsection*{Chains}

What shape do you think a chain takes on if it is pinned at both ends,
and allowed to hang freely in between? Take your best guess and don’t
worry about guessing correctly. We'll solve this problem shortly.


If you guessed that the curve is a parabola, then you are in good
company.  Galileo also believed that a hanging chain assumed a
parabolic shape as we see in the following passage from
his book
\href{https://www.maa.org/press/periodicals/convergence/mathematical-treasure-galileos-two-new-sciences}{Dialogue
  Concerning Two New Sciences} ($1638$).

    \it  ``Drive two nails into a wall at a convenient height and at

    length that the depth of its sag (curve or \foreign{sacca}) is
    equal to the length of the prism. This chain will assume the form
    of a parabola, so that if this form be marked by points on the
    wall we shall have described a complete parabola which can be
    divided into two equal parts by drawing a vertical line through a
    point midway between the two nails .\ .\ .\ Any ordinary mechanic

            \centerline{\includegraphics*[height=1.3in,width=3in]{../Figures/HangingChainSchematic}}
      \label{fig:HangingChainSchematic}
    \end{wrapfigure}
    This problem is very similar to finding the shape of the
    suspension bridge cable.  The difference here is that since there
    is no deck to support, the only vertical force will be the weight
    of the chain itself, so we can't ignore the weight of the chain
    the way we ignored the weight of the cable in the suspension
    bridge.

    Let $w$ represent the weight density of the chain in newtons per
    meter and $s$ represent the length of the chain from the lowest
    point to a point $P=(x,y)$ on the chain.  Show that the curve
    represented by the chain must satisfy the differential equation
    <me>

      \dfdx{y}{x}=\frac{ws}{H}.\label{eq:Catenary1}
    
</me>
  \end{embeddedproblem}
  
  OK, but so what? All Equation~(\ref{eq:Catenary1}) says is that the
  proportion $\dfdx{y}{x}$ is equal to the proportion $\frac{ws}{H}$.
  
  If we could \emph{solve} this equation for $y(x)$ then the graph of
  $y$ would be the shape of the chain, but sadly we don't have the
  tools to do that (yet).

  So why did we bother writing down
  Equation~(\ref{eq:Catenary1}) at all? Does this tell us anything
  about the shape of the hanging chain?
  
  Yes. Actually it does.

  The fact is that in our attempts to describe the world around us
  using mathematics we can't actually solve \emph{most} of the
  equations we write down. Real world phenomena are just too
  complex. But just writing them down is a step forward.  
  Although we can't (yet) solve Equation~(\ref{eq:Catenary1}), and
  thereby find the shape of a hanging chain, we can use it to
  eliminate some shapes.  In particular, we can now show that Galileo
  was wrong about the shape of a hanging chain.


\begin{embeddedproblem}[Galileo was wrong!]
  \label{PIC:catenary}
  
  The difficulty is that we have the wrong variable on the right side
  of Equation~\ref{eq:Catenary1}. Since $y$ depends on $x$ we'd like
  to have only the variables $x$ and $y$, appearing in our
  equation. Instead we have $x$, $y$, and $s$. And we really don't
  know anything about $s$.

  However, recall that we do know something about $\dx{s}$.

  \begin{enumerate}[label={  (\alph*)}] 
  \item Use a differential triangle to show that the hanging chain
    curve must satisfy the differential equation
    <me>

    \dfdxn{y}{x}{2}=\frac{w}{H}  \dfdx{s}{x}=\frac{w}{H}
    \sqrt{1+\left(\dfdx{y}{x}\right)^2 }.\label{eq:CatenaryDiffeq}
  
</me>
  \hint{Recall the $\d{s}$ represents a differential along the
    direction of the curve. How is it related to $\d{x}$ and $\d{y}$?}
  \item Show that the general parabola $y=ax^2+bx+c$ does \emph{not} satisfy this
    differential equation (and so Galileo was mistaken!)  .
  \item Show that, in fact no nonzero polynomial
    $y=a_0+a_1x+a_2x^2+\ldots+a_nx^n$ satisfies  Equation~\ref{eq:CatenaryDiffeq}. \\
    \hint{Suppose it did satisfy the equation.  If we were
      to square both sides of the equation, what would be the degree of
      each side?}
  \end{enumerate}
\end{embeddedproblem}



Galileo's brilliance is not at all diminished  by this error.
As we said in Chapter~\ref{cha:problem-solving}, smart people make
mistakes!  This is how they get to be smart. You should follow the
example of Galileo (and Newton, and Leibniz) by making and embracing
lots of mistakes. But don't forget to learn from them as well.
Also, in fairness to Galileo, he did not have access to  the Calculus tools that
make this problem tractable. We do.


\subsection*{Domes}
 In Problem~\#\ref{PIC:catenary} we saw that the shape of a hanging chain is not a
parabola as Gal\-i\-le\-o believed. But it actually shows much more than
that. It shows that the shape of a hanging chain is not the graph of
any polynomial regardless of its degree. (A parabola is the
graph of
a polynomial of degree $2$.) This result tell us   that the set of
polynomials is too small to model all of the phenomena we observe in
the world. The solution of the hanging chain problem  will require a larger class of
functions.

The curve which \emph{does} satisfy
equation~(\ref{eq:Catenary1}), and thus is the shape of a hanging
chain is called the catenary. This is
not especially illuminating since
the word ``catenary'' is derived from the Latin word {\it catena}
which simply means chain.

ancient times
The Pantheon in Rome was completed during the reign of Hadrian and
de\-di\-ca\-ted a\-round $126$~AD. It is not known who designed it, but there
is evidence\aside{For example, its shape.} which suggests that a
catenary design was employed.

The
architect
\href{https://www.britannica.com/biography/Filippo-Brunelleschi}{Filippo
  Brunelleschi} ($1377-1446$) used a hanging chain to develop the
shape of the dome of the
\href{http://www.museumsinflorence.com/musei/cathedral_of_florence.html}{Cathedral
  of Santa Maria del Fiore}  in Florence, Italy in the Middle Ages.

A number of modern architects and masons have used the catenary to design
arches and domes (a rotated
arch) as well.

 \end{wrapfigure}
 For example, the mathematician and architect
 \href{https://mathshistory.st-andrews.ac.uk/Biographies/Wren/}{Sir
   Christopher Wren} ($1632-1723$) used the shape of the catenary arch
 in the  design
 and construction of the structural part of the dome on
 \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St_Paul%27s_Cathedral}{St Paul's
   Cathedral in London.}

 Wren was assisted in designing St.  by his good
 friend
 \href{https://mathshistory.st-andrews.ac.uk/Biographies/Hooke/}{Robert
   Hooke} ($1635-1703$), who\aside{Hooke is also famous for showing
   that the contracting force of a stretched spring is proportional to
   the amount of stretching. This is known as ``Hooke's Law.'' We will
   examine this in more depth in
   Section~\ref{sec:simple-harm-oscill}. } advised him that the cross
 section of the dome should be an inverted catenary: ``As hangs a
 flexible cable so, inverted, stand the touching pieces of an arch.''

     The idea to use catenaries in building design was most likely
     originally motivated by experimentation and intuition. But, after
     Calculus was invented, it became possible to explain why they are so
     stable.
     When the forces involved in causing a hanging chain to fall
     into the shape of a catenary are inverted (turned upside down) then
     the weight of the catenary arch is 
     directed tangentially along the arch toward the base.
     Catenary arches are still in use today in part because they
     have this property.

     Because of its inherent strength and stability the catenary
     arch is still a common choice for arches and domes today. For
     example, the roof of the East Rail Station in Budapest, Hungary
     is also a catenary.
     We've seen that a catenary is not a parabola, but we do not
     yet have a formula for the catenary curve.  
     We will address, this  question in
     Problem~\#\ref{problem:HangingChain}.

     \subsection*{Telescopes}
     Though he didn't invent the telescope, Galileo is usually cited
     as the first
     person\aside{\href{https://mathshistory.st-andrews.ac.uk/Biographies/Harriot/}{Thomas
         Harriot} did it before Galileo but Harriot didn't publish his
       observations.} to use a telescope to discover, for example,
     craters and mountains on the surface of the Moon, the phases
     Venus, and the moons of Jupiter. This work helped convince
     Galileo of the validity
     of
     \href{https://mathshistory.st-andrews.ac.uk/Biographies/Copernicus/}
     {Nicolaus Copernicus}'s heliocentric (sun-centered) model of the
     solar system, for which he (Galileo) was eventually condemned by
     the Inquisition.
     
     All telescopes follow one of two basic designs, refractive and
     reflective. Refractive telescopes us the refractive property of
     light described by Snell's Law (see
     Section~\ref{sec:snells-law-refr}) to reduce the large image
     entering the telescope to a smaller area, thus focusing the image
     for the observer. Galileo used a refractive telescope

  Refractive telescopes work well for relatively close objects, but
  since refraction separates light into its various color components
  (think of light passing through a prism) it tends to create little
  rainbows (usually called chromatic aberrations) in the image.

    \begin{wrapfigure}[11]{r}{1.85in}
    \vskip-2mm 
    \captionsetup{labelformat=empty}
    \href{https://www.lbto.org/}{\includegraphics*[height=1.2in,width=1.85in]{../Figures/MountGraham}}
        \caption{\textcolor{black}{{\centerline{The Large Binocular Telescope}}\\ \centerline{Mt. Graham, Arizona}}}
    \label{fig:MountGraham}
  \end{wrapfigure}
  
  Because of his work in optics, Newton realized that he could use the
  reflective properties of the parabola to achieve greater
  magnification with a smaller physical device while simultaneously
  avoiding the chromatic aberrations.  All modern research telescopes
  are built on Newton's 
  original design, which uses parabolic mirrors
  to reflect light toward the focus of the par\-a\-bo\-la, where a
  secondary mirror reflects it to the eyepiece.

  For example the each mirror of the two large mirrors required by the
  Large Binocular Telescope at Mt. Graham, Arizona is $8.4$ meters in
  diameter.  The image below
  gives a sense of the size of one of these mirrors. \\
        \centerline{\includegraphics*[height=1.2in,width=2.5in]{../Figures/SpinCasting1}}


  To produce a large, perfectly parabolic mirror
  the \href{https://mirrorlab.arizona.edu/}{Richard F. Caris Mirror
    Laboratory} uses a process called spin casting, where 
   high quality borosilicate glass is place into a revolving furnace.  As
  the furnace spins the glass liquefies and the rotational forces push
  the surface of the glass into a parabolic shape.

  
  As  the molten glass spins the middle goes down and the
  sides go up. As we will see momentarily the surface generated must
  be a parabola.  The shape of the mirror, and hence
its focal
  length, will be affected by the rotational speed of the glass. The
  question is, how fast must we spin the furnace to produce a
  particular focal length?

  To begin to answer that question we will need to think about a typical point
  mass at a point on the surface of the molten glass as shown below.
  Suppose the glass is spinning at an angular
velocity of $\omega$~$\frac{\text{radians}}{\text{second}}$.  Our task
is to find the function $y=y(x)$ whose graph is shape of a
cross-section of the surface of the liquid glass.\\
  \centerline{\includegraphics*[height=1.8in,width=4.2in]{../Figures/Spincasting8}}
  

The red arrow in the diagram depicts the force keeping
the point mass elevated and spinning in a circle. It will be
perpendicular to the surface of the liquid, as shown.  (Think about a
hose with a hole in it.  The water sprays out in a stream
perpendicular to the hose.)

If we separate that force into its vertical and horizontal components,
as shown in the diagram, the magnitude of the vertical component of the
force is $mg$, where $g$ is the acceleration due to gravity.  This is
the force needed to counter the weight of the particle.  The only
horizontal force is the centripetal force due to the spinning of the
furnace, which is $mx\omega^2$.  (We will derive this formula
analytically in Chapter\ref{cha:calc-trig} when we have extended the
scope of our differentiation rules.  For now we will assume this is
correct and proceed.)

     \label{PIC:SpinCast1} 
    \begin{enumerate}[label={  (\alph*)}]
    \item
      Use the diagram above to show that the curve $y=y(x)$ must satisfy the
      differential equation
      $$
      \dfdx{y}{x}=\frac{\omega^2}{g} x.
      $$
      \hint{The slope of the line tangent to the parabola at $(x,y)$
        will be $\dfdx{y}{x}$. This will be perpendicular to the force
      acting at that point,  represented by the red arrow.}
    \item Show that  $y(x)$ must be a parabola to satisfy this
      differential equation.
    \item Using the value
      $g=9.8\frac{\text{meters}}{\text{second}^2}$, graph the parabola
      from part (b).  for $\omega =1, 2, 3$.  Do these graphs
      coincide with your intuition about what should happen as the
      liquid rotates faster?
    \end{enumerate}
  \end{embeddedproblem-enumerate}

  In antiquity the reflective properties of all of the conic sections
  (parabola, ellipse and hyperbola) were worked out via very laborious
  geometric arguments. In Chapter~\ref{chapter:ScienceBeforeCalc} we
  saw that Roberval reestablished these properties using his more
  dynamic (if somewhat questionable) approach.  The next two problems
  will reestablish the reflective property of the parabola once more
  using a combination of Geometry and Calculus.

  Recall from Chapter~\ref{chapter:ScienceBeforeCalc} that any light
  ray  parallel to the axis of a parabola will reflect to a
  single point (the focus of the parabola).

     A parabola may be defined geometrically as the set of points
     equidistant from a given point, the focus, and a given line, the
     directrix as shown below.\\

    \item In Problem~\#\ref{PIC:SpinCast1}, show that in order to spin

        the correct focal length) is of paramount importance in the
        performance of the telescope.  To give you a notion of the

        of one of the primary mirrors in the Large Binocular Telescope
        to a precision of $30$ nanometers ($3,000$ times
        thinner than a human hair).} at $(0,p)$ the angular velocity
