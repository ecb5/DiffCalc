  <p>
    For many years we (the authors) taught Differential Calculus in what
    has become in the last century or so, the traditional format. Limit
    definitions and theorems came first (presented formally when we were
    young; less so as we gained experience). From there we built up the
    necessary logical structure piece by piece until we had, after much
    effort, constructed the tools our students would need to solve the
    traditional problems of Calculus. It usually took a significant
    fraction of the semester to reach this point and we often found that
    for many of our students any bright eyed enthusiasm they might have
    brought to the course had been washed away in a cascade of unmotivated
    definitions (limit), apparently obvious statements made unnecessarily
    obscure (the limit of a constant is the constant), and rote
    computations utterly divorced from anything in the real world. We
    expect that you have encountered similar difficulties.
  </p>
  <p>
    Even a cursory look at history shows us that new mathematics is almost
    never created by building it up logically from first principles in
    this fashion. New mathematics is created to solve a particular
    problem. It may or may not be a real-world problem, but always some
    specific problem is the focal point of our efforts. If new methods are
    needed then we invent, we try, we discard, invent again, try again,
    and discard again, <foreign>ad nauseum</foreign> until a viable approach is
    finally uncovered. Then, and only then, is a rigorous, logical
    foundation sought.
  </p>
  <p>
    Think for a moment about how you do your research. First you identify
    a problem. Are the foundational issues at the front of your mind?
    Probably not. At first you're just curious. You kick ideas around,
    trying to find some workable approach. In short, you play with the
    problem. You have fun with it as a means to understanding it. When you
    solve your problem you probably <em>believe</em> your result long before
    you prove it.  Foundational issues, proofs, come later when you need
    to show that your results are valid. This is usually less fun.
  </p>
  <p>
    Creating new mathematics and learning new mathematics are very similar
    activities.  Think about how you learn new mathematics. When reading a
    journal article do you plod from definition, to lemma, to proof, to
    theorem, to proof, entirely absorbing each before moving on to the
    next?  Probably not. Most likely you read ahead to get an overall
    sense of the result. Then you backtrack, skip forward, play with the
    ideas, generate your own examples and counterexamples. When your
    example is inconsistent with a theorem in the article you examine it
    closely in order to resolve the discrepancy and better understand the
    ideas in the article. In short, you begin by playing with the ideas
    and having fun with them.
  </p>
  <p>
    We rarely focus on rigor when we start to learn new mathematics
    ourselves because experience has taught us that rigor usually proceeds
    from a deep intuitive understanding. And as a result of training. It
    does not come easily, but with effort rigor emerges.  If we force our
    students to plow through formal definitions, theorems, lemmas, and
    proofs before showing them the intuitive beauty and usefulness of our
    topic, before they can see the need for formal definitions, theorems,
    lemmas, and proofs, then we are demanding of them what we rarely ask
    of ourselves.  The first job of the teacher is to foster enthusiasm in
    the student, to pique their curiosity and to show them, in Descartes'
    phrase, "the pleasure of discovery."  For those who need it there is
    time later for the hard work of rigor.
  </p>

    <aside><p>Presumably we have nothing to teach the instructor,
    although we flatter ourselves that we might, occasionally, do so
    anyway.</p>
    </aside>
  <p>
    In the first part ("From Practice  . . . ")  of this text our
    audience is the usual mix of students in a typical first semester,
    college level, Calculus class. <em>All</em> of the students, not just
    the budding mathematicians, and certainly not the
    instructor.  We begin in part one as Leibniz did, with the highly
    intuitive -- if questionable -- notion of the differential.  We do not
    hide the problems inherent in this approach. We simply don't dwell on
    them. We point out the logical problems that accompany the use of
    differentials whenever we can without breaking up the flow of the
    text. We do this because it is important for students, <em>all</em>
    students, to be aware of these issues. But we defer their resolution
    until part two ("\  . . .  to Theory") when, hopefully, they will
    have gained an appreciation of the need for rigor.
  </p>
  <p>
    In part two our purpose is to put a solid, rigorous foundation under
    the differentiation techniques derived in part one. Thus our style and
    approach changes. We become more formal, more "mathematical." We
    define and prove limit theorems and use these to derive the
    differentiation rules. But in contrast with the traditional approach
    we are not deriving the differentiation techniques in order to use
    them. In part two the point is to formally, rigorously justify rules
    with which the student should already be quite conversant.
  </p>
  <p>
    In part one we address the question, "How can we use Calculus to
    explore, and explain, our world?"  In part two the question is "Why
    does Calculus work?"
  </p>
  <p>
    In this we follow our history. Calculus existed as an intuitive set of
    computational tools for approximately <m>200</m> years before the limit
    theory made it rigorous. Surely there is no harm in allowing our
    students to view it the same way for a few weeks.
  </p>
  <p>
    Moreover proceeding in this way allows us to present the need for
    rigor itself as a problem to be solved, rather than an abstract theory
    untethered from reality. For example we do not pretend that the proof
    of the statement, "If <m>\limit{x}{a}{f(x)}</m> and <m>\limit{x}{a}{g(x)}</m>
    both exist then <m>\limit{x}{a}{\left(f(x)+g(x)\right)}</m> also exists and
    is equal to the obvious sum," is useful for anything other than
    establishing with full rigor what we already believe, intuitively, to
    be true. We make no such pretense because the history of our topic
    shows that this is in fact the truth. Limits were not invented to
    create Calculus, they were invented to justify it after the fact, to
    make it rigorous.

    <title>What Do Students Need From Calculus?</title>
    <p>
      A mechanical engineer who designs cars for a living must necessarily
      have a deep understanding of the inner workings of the propulsion,
      braking, cooling, and other systems built into every automobile.
    </p>
    <p>
      A race car driver will understand some, but not necessarily all, of
      the mechanical principles underlying those systems. But the racer will
      have a much more comprehensive, and deeply intuitive, understanding of
      the physics of motion that keep the car on the road under the extreme
      conditions of a race.
    </p>
    <p>
      A mathematician who merely drives to and from their workplace while
      daydreaming about mathematics needs to understand no more about the
      car than how to make it move, stop, and change direction.
    </p>
    <aside><p>We may
    understand more than that, and many of us do, but this is all we
    need.</p>
    </aside>

    <p>
      But all of these people start at the same point: They learn how to
      drive the car.
    </p>
    <p>
      Much the same can be said of any tool. Some need to understand it
      thoroughly at every level. Some need a deep intuitive grasp of its
      extreme capabilities. And some need only know enough to keep from
      hurting themselves with it. But all begin by learning how to use the
      tool properly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Calculus is a tool. It was invented to solve real world problems in
      science and engineering.  The racers in our metaphor are scientists,
      engineers, and businessfolk. They need, and many frequently have, a
      deep intuitive feel for the kinds of problems Calculus can be used to
      solve, and their intuitive understanding enables them to adapt
      Calculus techniques to novel problems. But their understanding is
      necessarily qualitatively different from that of a mathematician.
    </p>
    <p>
      As mathematicians we have (indeed we must have) a deep understanding
      of what Calculus is, what it does, and what it can not do. We see and
      understand the purpose of every nuance in phrasing, the role of every
      lemma and theorem, every small change in notation. We understand the
      immense need to state our assumptions, to formulate careful, precise
      definitions and to rigorously prove our theorems.
    </p>
      <aside><p>The ordinary drivers in our metaphor are the,
      sadly rare, students in the liberal arts who take Calculus out of
simple curiosity.</p>
</aside>    <p>
      Because most college level Calculus courses contain students with a
      wide variety of interests and goals a Calculus textbook must meet the
      needs of students with a wide variety of interests and goals. This
      seems like it must be nearly impossible until we think about it for a
      bit. Just as we can begin the education of engineers, racers, and
      ordinary drivers
 at the same point -- the location and use of the
controls of a car -- we can begin the education of engineers,
scientists, and mathematicians at the same point -- with the
computational techniques from Calculus that are most useful and
universal, with examples displaying how these techniques can be used
to solve technical problems, and with problems and drills designed to
develop skill with them. This is what we've tried to do in this
textbook.
</p>
<p>
  After learning to drive racers will go on to become more skillful at
  using the car, and there is no point in bludgeoning them with the
  details of say, the compressibility characteristics of steering
  fluid. Certainly they must be familiar with the need for steering
  fluid, and they should have a passing familiarity with the role of
  steering fluid in the overall steering system. In short, they need to
  know that the tools they are using have been carefully designed and
  that they work. But no more than that is necessary until and unless
  they need to help design a new steering system for their car.
</p>
<p>
  In the same way science, engineering and business students need to be
  aware of the need for rigor, even if it never impinges on their daily
  lives.  They should be familiar with the need for limits as a means of
  providing rigor and they should have a passing familiarity with the
  role of epsilons and deltas. In short, they need to know that the
  tools they are using have been carefully designed and that they
  work. But no more than that is necessary until and unless there is
  some specific need.
</p>
<p>
  On the other hand mathematics students do need a nuanced understanding
  of both the practice and theory of Calculus if they are to
  successfully continue their studies. In addition to the ability to use
  Calculus, they need to understand limits and they need to understand the
  role of epsilons and deltas
</p>
<p>
  Calculus was invented as a problem solving tool, and in our opinion,
  this is how it is most easily and intuitively understood by the
  beginning student.  So part one of this text is aimed at all of the
  students in a typical first year college class. As a result our
  approach is intuitive and problem oriented.
</p>
<p>
  While the audience for part two is still all of the students in the
  class, it is aimed, primarily, at the budding mathematicians. You will
  see that in part two our language and presentation become more formal,
  more mathematical. This is deliberate. A young mathematician needs to
  be exposed to the formalisms of our discipline and this is an
  appropriate place to begin.
</p>
<p>
  But this does not mean that part two should be reserved only for
  honors classes full of mathematics majors. The budding engineer,
  scientist, or financial analyst will most likely never need to use
  epsilons and deltas, or even limits, in their daily work. But, like
  the racer who should understand the need for steering fluid, but does
  not need a detailed understanding of its essential characteristics,
  these students should understand the need for rigor, even if they do
  not understand it in the same detail that a mathematician must. Many
  of these students will probably view this as an unnecessary burden,
  and will complain about it. But an education should provide students
  with what they need, not what they enjoy.
</p>
<p>
  And sometimes, every now and then, some of them will find, much to
  their surprise, that the beauty and intricacy of a rigorous, well
  formed argument is as captivating to them as it is to us. We should
  provide our students with the opportunity to be captivated.

<paragraphs xml:id="StartlingChoices">
<title>Some (Possibly Startling) Choices We've Made</title>
<p>
  You will very likely find some of the choices we've made quite
  startling. We describe some of them here and explain our rationale.
</p>
<p>
<dl width="wide">
<li>
<title>Leibniz' Differentials </title>
<p>
  We use Leibniz' differentials almost exclusively throughout part one
  of the text.  We state the differentiation rules in their
  differential form (as apposed to their derivative form), and we
  think of the expression <m>\dfdx{y}{x}</m> as the ratio of the
  differentials <m>\dx{y}</m> and <m>\dx{x}</m>, just as Leibniz
  did. We do this for several reasons.
</p>
<p>
  Of all the various notations for the derivative we believe that the
  differential ratio <m>\dfdx{y}{x}</m> to be the most intuitively
  expressive for the beginner. For Leibniz, the Bernoullis, Euler, and
  and their peers <m>\dfdx{y}{x}</m> was a fraction. They thought of
  it as a fraction and they worked with it as a fraction. And this
  worked for them. They got correct results thinking this way, and the
  results they obtained have come down to us with the name "Calculus."
  There is no reason not to teach our students to use this highly
  intuitive (albeit questionable) approach to computations.
</p>
<p>
  Indeed, most teachers already do this. If you doubt the truth of the
  previous statement give a moment's thought to how you teach students
  to do integration by substitution, integration by parts, or line and
  path integrals.
</p>
  <p>
    We believe that the best pedagogy is one which meets the
    students where they are. In our experience students at this level
    have only the most tenuous grasp of the function concept
    but they understand slopes, as fractions, very well. So they will
    naturally interpret the symbol <m>\dfdx{y}{x}</m> as a slope, just as
    Leibniz did. Admittedly this is not a mathematically mature
    understanding, but mathematical maturity is a goal of the first
    course in Calculus, not its starting point.
</p>

  <p>
    Calling the derivative a "derived function" is not as helpful as
    it would be to a mature mathematician.  In our experience students
    will generally see <m>f(x)</m> and <m>f(a)</m> as the same thing,
    even if they are explicitly told that <m>x</m> is a variable and
    <m>a</m> is a constant. Function notation is not the cause of this
    misinterpretation, but it doesn't prevent it either. If you ask a
    student at this level "If <m>g(x) = f(a)</m>, is <m>g^\prime(x) =
    f^\prime(x)?</m>" an alarming number will say yes.
</p>

  <p>
    The formula <m>y=</m>(some expression in <m>x</m>) appears frequently and
    we will refer to it variously as a graph, an equation, or a
    function. We realize how annoying this lack of precision will be to
    you, a mature mathematician. But remember that this text is not
    written for you. Except in the section you are reading now we speak
    directly to the student, not to you. In our experience most students
    have only the most tenuous grasp of the distinctions between an
    equation, its graph, and the underlying function (or functions).
  For that simple reason we don't distinguish between them either, at first.
</p>
<p>
  You will, no doubt, argue that these distinctions need to be
  taught. And you are right of course. But taught by whom?
</p>
<p>
  We do not believe that deep abstractions, the notion of a function
  for example, are best explained in a written textbook. Teaching an
  abstract concept requires many examples, drawings, verbal
  explanations and even, occasionally, vigorous hand waving.
</p>
<p>
  In short, we believe this is the purview of the instructor who is
  physically in the classroom with the student -- you. If it helps to
  give the students an impassioned, wild-eyed rant about these lazy,
  or incompetent authors who aren't using mathematical terminology
  correctly then by all means do that. We won't mind. We think of
  ourselves as your partners, or co-teachers. In that role we've tried
  to we create teachable moments for you to exploit. This is one such.
</p>
<p>
  But, as a mature mathematician, you will surely find this very
  grating. Please know that our decision is not an oversight, and
  certainly not laziness. It is a deliberate pedagogical choice. When
  you find yourself being irritated by our choices we suggest you look
  for ways to use them effectively.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<title>Rigor, and the (Apparent) Lack Thereof</title>
<p>
  There are places where we will seem to be playing very fast and loose
  with definitions and concepts, and this choice will also grate on the
  sensibilities of a mature mathematician. This will be more pronounced
  in the beginning, but it will occur throughout. %  Even in part two
  % where we claim (above) to be focusing on rigor we do not, for example,
  % define continuity before we use it.
  As we observed before, this is the
  nature of doing mathematics. Definitions and concepts emerge from our
  attempts to solve specific problems and there is nothing wrong with
  letting the student see this process in action.
</p>
<p>
  But some students will surely find this apparent lack of precision
  upsetting. That can be be counterproductive if it is ignored. We've
  tried to anticipate this as much as possible by explicitly pointing
  out for example, that we are computing slopes of tangent lines before
  actually defining a tangent line and assuring them that a definition
  is coming (see <xref ref="SECdefin-tang-line">Section</xref>). Essentially we ask
  the student to be patient. We will eventually circle back with the
  rigorous definitions necessary to clarify concept.
</p>
<p>
  But we cannot anticipate all possible questions. When a student
  displays frustration with say, the lack of a definition, you may well
  have a fledgling mathematician on your hands. Point them to a place
  (either in this text or elsewhere) where their question is
  answered. Or answer it yourself.
</p>
<p>
  Then invite them to major in mathematics.  Tell them that in the
  mathematical community their detail-oriented predisposition for
  precision will make them welcome, not weird.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<title>Fluxions, Fluents, and Newton's Dot Notation</title>
<p>
  When we have taught Calculus in the traditional format we have found
  that students come away believing that slope~<m>=</m>~derivative with
  distressing regularity. In order to stress that this is not always the
  right way to understand the symbol <m>\dfdx{y}{x}</m> we sometimes use the
  dot notation when the derivative represents a velocity, a change of
  position with respect to time.  We are also careful to point out that
  if <m>y=y(x)</m> then <m>\dfdx{y}{x}</m> is properly interpreted as "the rate
of change of <m>y</m> with respect to <m>x</m>" and that it is only when <m>x</m>
and <m>y</m> represent coordinates in the plane that this should be
understood as a slope. % When <m>x</m>
% represents time <m>\dfdx{y}{x}</m> should be understood as a velocity or,
% in Newton's phrase, a "fluxion."
</p>
<p>
  For Newton the only independent variable was time, and his dot
  notation reflects that assumption. If <m>x</m> represents a "flowing
  quantity" (Newton's phrase) then <m>\dot{x}</m> indicates the velocity
  with which it flows.  For Leibniz (and most of us) this is represented
  by <m>\dfdx{x}{t}</m>. Although the dot notation has fallen out of favor in
  mathematics, it is still widely used in the sciences and
  engineering. We believe it is a disservice to students in those majors
  to pretend that Newton's dot notation does not exist in the modern
  world. Worse, since many of our students take introductory physics
  (where they see dotted derivatives daily) and Calculus at the same
  time we only make ourselves look insular and dogmatic by pretending
  that the dot notation doesn't exist.
</p>
<p>
  Not only do we use Newton's notation, but in
  <xref ref="SECnewt-meth-flux">Section</xref> we sometimes also his language. When
  time is the variable we call <m>\dot{x}=\dfdx{x}{t}</m> the "fluxion" of
  <m>x</m>, just as Newton did.
</p>
<p>
  We did not originally intend to go this far because "fluxion" (and
  its counterpart "fluent") are very decidedly archaic words. No one
  uses them any more. But having decided to use the dot notation we soon
  realized that we could also use Newton's language to emphasize that
  the derivative should not always be interpreted as a slope. And no one
  is harmed by learning more words.
</p>
</li>
<li>
  <title>{Polar Coordinates and Parametric Equations</title>
  <p>
    Traditionally parametric equations and polar coordinates have been
    taught in the second Calculus course. But we've brought them, lightly,
    into the this first course.
  </p>
  <p>
    We have done this for a couple of reasons. First, we believe it is
    pedagogically advantageous to introduce new concepts, and the
    associated notation, in the simplest possible context first. Thus, in
    this text we go no further than to observe that if <m>t</m> represents time
    then the parametric function <me>P(t)=
    \begin{ParamEq} {x(t)} {y(t)} {}
    \end{ParamEq}=
    \begin{ParamEq} {t^2} {t^3-t} {}
    \end{ParamEq}</me> can be thought of as representing the motion of a
    point in the plane.
  </p>
  <p>
    A second impetus was our desire to address the derivative~<m>=</m>~slope
    problem we mentioned above. When working with the formula
    <m>r(\theta)=\sin(3\theta)</m> in polar coordinates it is not at all
    helpful to think of the function <m>\dfdx{r}{\theta} = -3\cos(3\theta)</m>
    as the slope of anything. A broader understanding of the symbolism is
    necessary.
  </p>
  <p>
    Similarly if <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> coordinates are given by the parametric
    function <m>P(t)</m> above then <m>\dfdx{y}{x}</m> is still the slope but
    <m>\dfdx{x}{t}=\dot{x}</m> and <m>\dfdx{y}{t}=\dot{y}</m> are velocities (or
    "fluxions" in Newton's phrase).
  </p>
</li>
<li>
  <title>Problems in Context</title>
  <p>
    You will notice that the problems do not appear all-in-a-lump at the
    ends of sections.  They are embedded in the text at the point where we
    discuss the methods needed to solve them. This seems to us a much
    better practice than lumping them all together in "Problem Sections"
    and forcing students to search backward through each section for the
    appropriate discussion.
  </p>
  <p>
    We find that it also encourages the students to actually read the
    text, since they know that the exposition near to their problem will
    be relevant to the problem. We suggest that you explicitly point out
    this aspect of our text to your students, since by the time they get
    to college many students have concluded that the only relevant parts
    of the textbook are the problems and the examples and they habitually
    skip everything else.
  </p>
</li>
<li>
  <title>There is No Solution Manual</title>
  <p>
    We have not written a solution manual for this text. Nor do we intend
    to. There are several reasons for this.
  </p>
  <p>
    First, in an age when every college student can open a web browser and
    type in, for example,
    Differentiate <m>y=x^2*cos(x)</m>
    and instantly
    get back not only the correct derivative, but also a step-by-step
    guide for how to do the computation, the point of spending any part of
    our lives providing the solution to such drill problems is completely
    lost on us. We have better things to do.
</p>

<p>
  Second, many Calculus problems can be checked by an appropriately
  drawn graph. For example, if the problem is to find an equation of the
  line tangent to the graph of <m>y=3\sqrt{x} -x^2</m> at <m>x=5</m> the student
  need only graph the function and their solution to see if they have
  found the correct line. Until now it would have been unreasonable to
  ask students to check their work by graphing but modern students have
  access to a dizzying array of graphing tools at the click of a
  mouse. And this will most likely always be true. In our opinion they
  should be encouraged to use the resources available to them.
</p>
<p>

  Third, as much as possible we have written the problems in such a way
  that the results of any computations needed are part of the problem
  statement. For example, one problem asks the student to show that if
  <m>x^2+y^2=1</m> then <m>\dfdxn{y}{x}{2}=-\frac{1}{y^3}</m>. Notice that the
  value of the second derivative is given in the problem. As much as
  possible we want to keep the students focused on understanding the
  problem, rather than rote computations.

  <title>Some Practical Advice</title>
  <p>
    <dl>
      <li>
        <title>{Precalculus vs. Pre-Calculus</title>
        <p>
          <xref ref="CHAPTERScienceBeforeCalc">Chapter</xref> is about both precalculus
          (meaning that it uses only the tools students learn before taking
          Calculus) and pre-Calculus (meaning that it is about the mathematical
          tools that were the historical precursors of Calculus).
        </p>
        <p>
          It is about precalculus because in this chapter we attempt to solve a
          number of Calculus-like problems using precalculus techniques (and
          clever tricks).  As such, this chapter fulfills the customary purpose
          of the introductory chapter of a Calculus text. It reinforces the idea
          that the students already have many very powerful tools in hand that
          are supplemented, not replaced, by Calculus. And it gives them a quick
          reminder of how to use some of these.
        </p>
    <p>
      Yes, we understand that many students have not sufficiently
      mastered this material. That is irrelevant. They have
      <em>seen</em> it, sometimes over and over, and they believe they
      understand it.
    </p>
<p>
  <xref ref="CHAPTERScienceBeforeCalc">Chapter</xref> is about pre-Calculus because
  we use it to set the stage for the "new method" (Leibniz' phrase) of
  Differential Calculus.  It is, after all, difficult to understand the
  point of a new method if the methods being replaced are unknown. In
  <xref ref="CHAPTERScienceBeforeCalc">Chapter</xref> we examine a few of the very
  clever tools invented by Fermat, Descartes, and Roberval which
  anticipated the Calculus of Newton and Leibniz. These ideas were very
  influential and helped shape the form that modern Calculus has taken,
  and they can be understood, with effort, by anyone reasonably skillful
  with the tools of precalculus.
</p>
<p>
  When we've taught in the traditional format we've tended to skip the
  introductory, or "review" chapter that appears in every Calculus
  text. Or, at least, we've given it very short shrift. We've done this
  because for the student it is frequently little more than a short
  recitation of previously studied algebraic, geometric, and
  trigonometric formulas. As faculty we of course see and understand the
  need for facility with of these formulas in the upcoming material. But
  the student does not.  From the point of view of the student this is
  simply a dull rehashing of known material. We serve
  neither our students nor ourselves if we start the semester out by
  boring them.
</p>

  <aside>
    <p>
      Particularly Fermat's <em>Method of Adequality</em>.</p>
  </aside>
<p>
  However we advise you very strongly to <em>not</em> give
  <xref ref="CHAPTERScienceBeforeCalc">Chapter</xref> short shrift. We have not
  simply rehashed a set of algebraic and trigonometric facts. Instead we
  use some basic Algebra and Geometry to study and discuss a few of the
  optimization and slope finding techniques that were precursors of
  Calculus. These techniques
 are very Calculus-like so they foreshadow the ideas
to come.  And the student has most likely never seen them before. Thus
they are inherently interesting (or at least not mind-numbingly
dull). It is useful to examine them, to see where they fall short,
before diving into Calculus itself. Also later in the text, we return
to some of the problems and examples from this chapter in order to
compare and contrast the Calculus and pre-Calculus methods.
</p>

<!-- <aside><p>Or at least not mind-numbingly -->
<!-- dull.</p> -->
<!-- </aside> -->
<p>
  But be warned: The techniques developed by the pre-Calculus pioneers
  are very clever. They are so genuinely appealing that it is easy to
  get caught up in them and spend too much time on them. We speak from
  experience. Be careful.
</p>

<title>Inquiry Based Learning (IBL)</title>
<p>

  We did not specifically design this to be an IBL text. However we are
  strong proponents of the idea that interesting and illuminative
  problems should drive any math course. We therefore believe that this
  text will work well in an IBL, as well as a more traditional,
  environment.
</p>
<p>

  Even if you do not teach in a 100\% IBL style, there is nothing wrong
  with coming in to class and telling your students, “Let’s look at some
  of your homework in class and see if we can figure out how to do it.”
  Of course, you will want to build a lesson around it and judge
  carefully how much of the solution to reveal.
</p>
<p>

  There is also nothing wrong with using some of the problems as
  possible test questions and putting a subset of them on tests,
  verbatim. You can also let students know that you might do this. Our
  experience says that if this doesn’t make them pay attention, then
  nothing will.
</p>
<p>

  Finally, there is also nothing wrong with saying, "I didn’t assign
  Problem \#(whatever), but it looks kind of interesting. Let's take a
  look at it anyway."
</p>
<p>

  That is how this book is written.  The problems really are the
  course. We tried very hard to let the problems drive the presentation,
  and we recommend that you do the same. If you don't like our problems
  use your own. We won't mind. In fact, if you have better problems
  please share them with us (see "A Plea For Help" below).

    The TRIUMPHS project
    consists of a collection
    of over <m>80</m> Primary Source Projects (PSPs) on a wide range of topics
    from courses across the undergraduate mathematics curriculum and all
    are freely available for download at the 
<url href="https://blogs.ursinus.edu/triumphs/" visual="https://blogs.ursinus.edu/triumphs/">TRIUMPHS website</url>
<!-- TRIUMPHS website: -->
<!--     \centerline{\href{https://blogs.ursinus.edu/triumphs/}{https://blogs.ursinus.edu/triumphs/}.} -->
  </p>
  <p>

    We quote from the project website:
  </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>      The TRIUMPHS project creates materials for use in the
    undergraduate mathematics classroom which teaches content based
    around original mathematical sources such as the writings of
    Poincaré, Euclid, Lobachevsky, Hausdorff, and many others. These
    materials are freely available and downloadable for use in the
    clasroom. The goal of the project is to write, develop,
    disseminate, and test these curricular materials.
    </p>    
</blockquote>
  <p>

    The TRIUMPHS project was ongoing at the same time we were writing this
    textbook. Since both projects proceed from the premise that history is
    a useful organizing strategy for teaching mathematics, and both are
    published under a Creative Commons license it seemed to us that our
    text could be enhanced by including (in
    <xref ref="CHAtriumphs:-prim-sourc">Appendix</xref>) those TRIUMPHS PSPs which
    were relevant to Calculus.
  </p>
  <p>

    At those points in the text which correspond to particular PSP a
    reference (and link) is provided.<!--  For example, at the beginning of -->
    <!-- <xref ref="SECcurvature">Section</xref> the following link appears: -->
    <!-- \TLogo{appendix:radi-curv-accord} -->
  </p>
  <p>

    We are grateful for the work of the specific TRIUMPHS authors we have
    included in this text, but we are also grateful for the TRIUMPHS
    project in general. There are TRIUMPHS PSPs for many, many more topics
    than we are able to include here and we highly recommend that you take
    a look at them and consider incorporating any appropriate PSPs into
    every course you teach. The TRIUMPHS project is described more fully
    in <xref ref="CHAtriumphs:-prim-sourc">Appendix</xref>.

  <title>Rantings From the Cranky Old Guys in the Back of the Room</title>
  <p>

    We (the authors of this text) have watched the following scene play
    out over and over again at professional meetings. The actors change
    but the script is surprisingly stable.
  </p>
  <p>

    A speaker is introduced, rises, and talks briefly about a problem
    they have encountered while teaching Calculus  . . .  or Basic
    Algebra  . . .  or Trigonometry  . . .  or whatever.  At some point
    the talk is shanghaied by a <alert>Cranky Old Guy</alert> (it is usually a
    guy) in the back of the room. He has identified the solution to
    <alert>The Problem</alert> with teaching Calculus  . . . or Basic Algebra
    . . .  or Trigonometry  . . . or whatever, and in order to fix
    <alert>The Problem</alert> all we have to do is follow his recipe. The
    audience is then treated to a sincere, vehement, wild-eyed, and often
    spittle-spewn description of his recipe that clearly emanates from the
    fervor of divine inspiration.
  </p>
  <p>

    We do not criticize the <alert>Cranky Old Guy</alert>.  We recognize that
    when you believe you have found a lighted path in a darkening forest
    it is hard to contain your excitement. Also we fear we may have more
    in common with him than we are entirely comfortable with.
  </p>
  <p>

    This text grew from our conviction that an historical approach to
    Calculus, particularly the use of the highly intuitive notion of the
    differential, which was used to excellent effect by the likes of
    Leibniz, the Bernoullis, L'Hopital, and the master, Euler, to name
    just a few, provides a viable, interesting, and useful framework for
    teaching Calculus.
  </p>
  <p>

    As we complete our text we are more convinced than ever that this is
    true.
  </p>

    <aside><p>Well, OK, sure. We actually do believe this is
    the best way. Without that conviction we'd never have finished. But
    we haven't completely lost touch with reality. As far-fetched as it
    seems to us, we recognize the possibility that we might be wrong.</p>
    </aside>
  <p>
    But if we're being honest we must admit the possibility that we're
    wrong.  We don't believe we've found the only way to teach Calculus,
    or even the best,
    or that everyone should teach this way. What we do have is a way to
    teach Calculus that is very <em>different</em> from what has been done
    for the past century or so. You will have to decide for yourself
    whether or not it works for you.
  </p>
  <p>

    It is also possible that in our conviction we may be edging into
    <alert>Cranky Old Guy</alert> territory. But we will leave that judgment to
    you. We don't really want to know.

  <title>A Plea For Help</title>
  <p>

    This text is not finished. No textbook ever is. Eventually the authors
    simply stop writing.
  </p>
  <p>

    But always there a very illuminating problem, a nice turn of phrase, a
    revealing metaphor, or a tangential subject which wasn't known at the
    time of writing that should have been included. And typos. Always,
    there are typos.
  </p>
  <p>

    A nice feature of
    publishing an online Open Educational Resource (OER) text like this
    one is that it can be revised more-or-less continuously as
    needed.
  </p>
    <aside><p>Obviously some care must be taken. We would not, for
    example, want to insert a new problem -- thereby changing the
    numbers of all subsequent problems -- during a semester while the
    text is being used. But spelling errors and typos can be addressed
    at any time.</p>
    </aside>
  <p>

    Even better, we are not limited to only using the work of the original
    authors. If you have a favorite problem that you use in your classroom
    and that you'd be willing to share please share it with us. If yours
    works better than a problem we already have, we'll happily swap it in.
    If yours simply fills a need that we've left unaddressed we'll be
    happy to include your problem. Naturally, we will give you credit for
    your work if you want.
  </p>
  <p>

    If you think we have a good approach but don't think we've really
    pulled it off you are free to obtain the source and
    re-write any part of it, or all of it, to suit your needs.
  </p>
  <aside><p>As of this
  writing the only way to do that is to ask us for it. Eventually
  (meaning, as soon as Boman figures out how to do it), the source
  files will be available in at least one online repository.</p>
