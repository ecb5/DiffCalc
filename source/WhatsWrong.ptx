<p>
To see what's wrong with differentials consider the circle and the
differential triangle below.
</p>
<image source="images/WrongWithDiff2.png" width="50%">

<p>

Suppose that <m>\dx{s}</m> is one of the differentials that makes up
the circle. Since <m>\dx{s}</m> is a non-zero increment it has two distinct
endpoints so we can draw the two radii shown. Because the two
(distinct) endpoints that lie on the circle are <em>infinitely</em>
close together the two lines have the same slope. But all of the radii
of a circle pass through the center of the circle so these two in
particular must also intersect at the center, and we conclude that we
have two parallel lines that intersect.</p>

<p>But the only way that can happen is if they are actually the same
line, and if they are the same line then the points on the circle are
not really distinct as we've drawn them. But if they are not distinct
then <m>\dx{x}</m>, <m>\dx{y}</m>, and <m>\dx{s}</m> are all actually <em>equal</em> to
zero. If <m>\dx{x}</m> =0 then <m>\dfdx{y}{x}</m> is meaningless (why?).</p>

<p>This simple argument appears to completely destroy the differential
foundation upon which we've based everything we've done up until
now. Try as we might we can't escape the contradictions inherent in
the very notion of infinitely small numbers.</p>

<p>This is very troubling.</p>

<p>
Berkeley's critique was both fierce and correct. Fortunately, it
was also (mostly) ignored in its time. Just as we have been so far,
mathematicians of the time were too busy <em>using</em> Calculus to
concern themselves much with the underlying foundational issues he
illuminated so well.  But these foundational issues are real and the
time has come for us to address the profound logical difficulties
inherent in the notion of an infinitely small quantity.
</p>
<p>
You may well wonder why a Bishop in the Church of England and a
philosopher would concern himself with the methods of scientific
analysis and investigation. The fact is that Berkeley didn't really
have any quarrel with the use of differentials (or fluxions) in
science at all. He was, in fact, a great admirer of Newton and he
understood very well that the techniques Newton and Leibniz had
introduced actually worked, at least most of the time. He says as much
himself in <pubtitle>The Analyst</pubtitle>
</p>
<historical> 
<title>Historical Note</title>
  <p>
    In the eighteenth century English nouns were frequently
    capitalized, and spelling was not as standardized as it is today,
    so Berkeley's work looks a little odd to modern
    eyes. Nevertheless, it is quite readable. Stretch yourself a bit.
    </p>
  </historical>
  <blockquote>
    <p><q>I have no Controversy about your Conclusions, but only about your
    Logic and Method . .  .  It must be remembered that I am not
    concerned about the truth of your Theorems, but only about the way
    of coming at them; . . . it may perhaps seem an unaccountable
    Paradox, that Mathematicians should deduce true Propositions from
    false Principles, be right in the Conclusion, and yet err in the
    Premises . . . </q>     (Section XX)</p>
  </blockquote>
<p>
Berkeley might not have bothered publishing his criticisms of Calculus
but during the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries a religious
movement known as <url href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/Deism" visual="https://www.britannica.com/topic/Deism">Deism</url>
(called
<q>Free-Thinking</q> in England) was very strong throughout Europe. Many
of the scientists of the age were supportive of the Deistic movement
because, while Deism itself is not a form of atheism, many of its
adherents were atheists. Moreover the Free-Thinkers in England
explicitly espoused the questioning and criticism of religious tenets
and attitudes.  Christianity was attacked by some Deists on the
grounds that it was not logical and contained too many mysteries.
</p>

<p>
As a member of the clergy Berkeley felt compelled to answer these
criticisms. Speaking directly to the English scientific community he
said, 
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>    
<q>Whereas then it is supposed, that you apprehend more
    distinctly, consider more closely, infer more justly, conclude
    more accurately than other Men, and that you are therefore less
    religious because more judicious, I shall claim the privilege of a
    Free-Thinker; and take the Liberty to inquire into the Object,
    Principles, and Method of Demonstration admitted by the
    Mathematicians of the present Age, with the same freedom that you
    presume to treat the Principles and Mysteries of Religion; to the
    end, that all Men may see what right you have to lead, or what
    Encouragement others have to follow you.</q>
    (Section II)
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
He made his purpose clear from the outset by including a biblical
verse (Mathew, chapter 7, verse 5) on the title page of <pubtitle>The
  Analyst</pubtitle>:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
<q>First cast out the beam out of thine own Eye; and then
shalt thou see clearly to cast out the mote out of thy brother<rsq/>s eye.</q>
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
So Berkeley's purpose in writing \pubtitle{The Analyst} was to defend
his religion rather than to attack mathematics. But he was well
acquainted with the adage, <q>The best defense is a good offense</q> and
he mounted a very good defense.
</p>
<p>
Some of Berkeley's specific criticisms will be illuminating.
</p>
<aside>
<p>The
  language of Calculus wasn't entirely established yet so when
  Berkeley says <q>Differences</q> he means what we've been calling
  differentials.</p></aside>
<blockquote>
<p>     <q> . . .  they consider the Increments or Decrements
    themselves, which they call Differences, and which are supposed to
    be infinitely small  . . . . Now to conceive a Quantity infinitely
    small, that is, infinitely less than any sensible or imaginable
    Quantity, or than any the least finite Magnitude, is, I confess,
    above my Capacity.  . . .  But to conceive a Part of such
    infinitely small Quantity, that shall be still infinitely less
    than it, and consequently though multipliy'd infinitely shall
    never equal the minutest finite Quantity is, I suspect, an
    infinite Difficulty to any Man whatsoever . . .</q> (Section V)
</p>
</blockquote>


<p>
Do you see what he's complaining about? Berkeley is questioning the
very existence of the differentials we have been relying on
since we began. And he has a point. As we've seen our differentials have
to satisfy two mutually exclusive properties. They can't be zero but
they must be smaller than <q>the least finite Magnitude.</q> On its face
this seems to be impossible.
</p>
 
<p>
But Berkeley goes further. He says that:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p> 
    <q> . . .  our modern Analysts are not content to consider
    only the Differences of finite Quantities: they also consider the
    the Differences of those Differences, and the Differences of the
    Differences of the first Differences. And so on<em>{ad
      infinitum.</em> That is, they consider Quantities infinitely less
    than the least discernible Quantity; and others infinitely less
    than those infinitely small ones; and still others infinitely less
    than the preceding Infinitesimals, and so on without end or limit
     . . .  And (which is most strange) although you should take a
    Million of Millions of these Infinitesimals, each whereof is
    supposed infinitely greater than some other real Magnitude, and
    add them to the least given Quantity, it shall be never the
    bigger. For this is one of the modest <em>postulata</em> of our
    modern Mathematicians, and it is a Corner-stone or Ground-work of
    their Speculations.</q>    (Section VI)
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Clearly Berkeley is contemptuous of the reasoning we've used to
justify our differentiation rules. And, again, he has a point. We have
pushed aside issues like this until now because we knew we were
showing you the correct techniques, even if our justifications would
not bear close examination. In the beginning it was more important
that you learn to <em>use</em> Calculus than that you understand
all of the logical subtleties that have been used to justify it
rigorously.
</p>
<p>
But wait a second. We <em>know</em> Calculus works. We've been
successfully solving abstruse and difficult problems with it for some
time. Throughout the first part of this text we've seen ample, even
overwhelming, evidence of this fact.  Isn't that sufficient?  Can't we
conclude from the fact that it <em>does</em> seem to work that the
notion of the differential is tenable after all?
</p>
<p>
Sadly, no. Berkeley thought of that too:
</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>
    <q>But this inverted way of demonstrating your Principles by your
    Conclusions . . .  is contrary to the Rules of Logic. The truth of
    a Conclusion will not prove either the Form or the Matter . . .
    to be true . . . I say that in every other Science Men prove their
    Conclusions by their Principles, and not their Principles by their
    Conclusions.</q>  (Section XX)
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
In order to have confidence in our knowledge, we must begin with
simple, clear ideas and build on them logically. Nothing else will do.
</p>

<p>


However, the path to simple, clear ideas is neither simple nor
clear. As we've mentioned before, it took about two hundred years for
the mathematical community to find and fully understand how to make
Calculus rigorous. We introduced the essential idea, the limit,
intuitively in <xref ref="SECTIONhoriz-asympt-as"></xref>.
</p>


<aside>
<title>Comment</title>
<p>
For us
      rigorous means that we can provide an argument that even Bishop
      Berkeley would accept.
</p>
</aside>


<p>

It would be possible to introduce the limit concept formally  and then
proceed to develop all of Calculus from it. Logically, there is
nothing wrong with this approach, and indeed, this is exactly how most
Calculus books present the topic. But the limit concept is  very
subtle. Unless you understand exactly what issues it is meant to
address it is very difficult to understand why it takes the form that
it does.
</p>
<p>

So, we will continue to build on our intuitive approach. However, our
focus has changed. In Part I we worked intuitively to build confidence
in the tools we were building. Here in Part II, our intention is to
highlight how and where our intuition falls short, so that when we
finally define the limit concept rigorously in
<xref ref="DEFINITIONlimits-at-real"></xref> it will be clear why it must
have the form that it does. What this means is that while our
intention is to finally  provide the rigor we've been lacking  we will
not actually achieve that until the end of
<xref ref="CHAPTERformal-limits"></xref>

In <xref ref="FromPractice"></xref>  we  defined the derivative of <m>y=y(x)</m> to be the differential
ratio <m>\dfdx{y}{x}</m>, but Berkeley shows in <pubtitle>The Analyst</pubtitle> that there
are considerable difficulties with this approach. How else might we
define the derivative? This is our next puzzle.
</p>
<p>

If we want to construct the line tangent at  a particular point, <m>(x_0, y(x_0))</m>
 on a given  curve we immediately have this problem: We only have one
point, but there are (infinitely) many lines through that point.  A
few of them are shown at the right.
How could we possibly pick the tangent line out of this mess?
</p>
<p>

The only distinguishing feature that the  tangent line has  is that it is in
fact tangent to our curve. That is not much to go on. But it is not
nothing either.
</p>

<image source="images/TangentLineCluster4.png" width="50%"/>
<!-- \begin{wrapfigure}[5]{l}{1in} -->

<!-- \label{fig:TangentLineCluster4} -->
<!-- \end{wrapfigure} -->
<p>

To form a line we desperately need another point. But where to find
one? The only other points we have to work with are points on the
curve itself.
</p>
<p>

 Choose a new point, say <m>(x_1, y(x_1)),</m> on our curve but a
little to the right of <m>(x_0,y(x_0))</m> and draw the line between
<m>(x_0,y(x_0))</m> and <m>(x_1,y(x_1))</m> as shown in  the sketch at the left.
Recall from <xref ref="CHAPTERcalc-trig"></xref> that the trigonometric secant
function is so called because it is the length of a line segment which
cuts the circle. The brown line in this sketch cuts the curve so it is
called a <term>secant line</term>.
</p>

<image source="images/TangentLineCluster3.png" width="50%"/>
<!-- \begin{wrapfigure}[]{r}{1.4in} -->

<!-- \centerline{\includegraphics*[height=1.1in,width=1.4in]{../Figures/TangentLineCluster3}} -->
<!-- \label{fig:x-yofx3} -->
<!-- \end{wrapfigure} -->
<p>

Similarly, if we choose a point a little to the left of <m>(x_0,y(x_0))</m>
and draw another secant line (shown in purple) it should be clear that
the   tangent line will be between the two
secant lines in the sketch at the right.
</p>
<p>



We have eliminated a lot of potential tangent lines, but we haven't
eliminated all of them.  Is there a way we could refine our search to
reduce the set of possible tangent lines even further?
</p>

<image source="images/TangentLineCluster.png" width="50%"/>
<!-- \begin{wrapfigure}[8]{l}{1.4in} -->
<!--   \vskip-4mm{} -->
<!--   \captionsetup{labelformat=empty} -->
<!-- \centerline{\includegraphics*[height=1.2in,width=1.4in]{../Figures/TangentLineCluster}} -->
<!-- \label{fig:TangentLineCluster} -->
<!-- \end{wrapfigure} -->

<p>
Sure. Choose <m>x_3</m> between <m>x_0</m> and <m>x_1</m> and draw the (blue) secant
line from <m>x_0</m> to <m>x_3,</m> and then choose <m>x_4</m> between <m>x_0</m> and
<m>x_2</m> and draw the (green) secant line through them to get the sketch
at the left.  It is clear that we have eliminated more potential
tangent lines, and that by continuing to choose points even closer to
<m>x_0</m> we can eliminate even more of them.
</p>
<p>
This approach seems to have some potential but there are at least two
difficulties:

<ol>
<li>
<p>
 So far we've relied heavily on diagrams to motivate our
  approach, and we know that diagrams can be misleading. 
  However this is not as serious as it seems to be because we are only
  using the diagrams to motivate a new definition for the
  derivative. Once that definition is in place we can disregard the
  diagrams and work directly with the definition
  regardless of the shape of the graph.
</p>
<p>
  You should generate a few graphs of your own, different from ours
  and from each other, to confirm that our arguments work for them as
  well.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
 We've been drawing the tangent lines but we need to keep in mind
  that the line tangent to the graph of our function at a point is not
  the derivative of the function.  The derivative is the slope of the
  tangent line. And slope is a number. The pictures we've drawn so far
  are very suggestive but they don't give us numbers.
</p>
</li>
</ol>

</p>

<image source="images/TangentLineCluster2.png" width="50%"/>
<!-- \begin{wrapfigure}[]{r}{2in} -->
<!--   \captionsetup{labelformat=empty} -->
<!--   \vskip-4mm{} -->
<!-- \centerline{\includegraphics*[height=1.4in,width=2in]{../Figures/TangentLineCluster2}} -->
<!-- \label{fig:TangentLineCluster2} -->
<!-- \end{wrapfigure} -->
<p>
For the time being, we will handle the first difficulty by ignoring
it. That is, we will continue to use diagrams to motivate our ideas,
but when we are done we will have circle back and ask ourselves if our
reliance on those diagrams has caused us to miss any special cases
which need to be addressed.
</p>
<p>
To handle the second difficulty consider the sketch at the right.
It is clear that if the tangent line, <m>T</m>, is
caught between lines secant lines <m>S_1</m> and <m>S_2</m>, then the <em>slope</em> of <m>T</m> is
necessarily caught between the <em>slope</em> of <m>S_1</m> and the
<em>slope</em> of <m>S_2.</m> Thus we have
<me>
\text{slope of } S_1=\frac{y(x_1)-y(x_0)}{x_1-x_0}\gt \text{slope of }T\gt
\frac{y(x_2)-y(x_0)}{x_2-x_0}=\text{slope of } S_2.
</me>
A specific example will be helpful.
</p>

<example xml:id="EXAMPLEy=x^2-limits">

  <!-- \label{ex:y=x^2-limits} -->
<p>

  Suppose <m>y=x^2</m>. We would like to compute the derivative (slope of
  the line tangent to the graph) of <m>y</m> at the point <m>x=2</m> by the the
  procedure indicated above.
</p>
<p>

  Before we start, observe that from our work with differentials we
  know what we are expecting to get. It is
  <me>y^\prime(2)=\left.\dfdx{y}{x}\right|_{x=2}=\bigeval{2x}{x}{2}=2\cdot2=4.</me>
</p>
<p>

  Taking <m>x_1=2.1</m> and <m>x_2=1.9,</m> gives
  <md>
<mrow>

    \frac{y(2.1)-y(2)}{2.1-2}\amp{}\gt y^\prime(2)\gt\frac{y(1.9)-y(2)}{1.9-2} \\
</mrow>
<mrow>

    \frac{(2.1)^2-(2)^2}{.1}\amp{}\gt  y^\prime(2)\gt\frac{(1.9)^2-y(2)}{.9}
</mrow>
<mrow>
    4.1\amp{}\gt y^\prime(2)\gt3.9.
</mrow>
</md>

</p>
<p>

  So our proposed procedure seems to be heading us in the right
  direction. If we take <m>x_3=2.01</m> and <m>x_4=1.99</m> we get
  <me>
  4.01\gt y^\prime(2)\gt3.99.
  </me>
  We say that <m>y^\prime(2)</m> is <term>bounded</term>, and that the numbers
  <m>4.01</m> and <m>3.99</m> are the <term>bounds</term>.

<p>
  The results in <xref ref="PROBLEMBounds"></xref> are looking very
  promising indeed. Since they are looking so promising we'll take a few
  minutes to simplify our notation a bit.
</p>

<p>
  It is tedious to have all of these subscripted <m>x</m> variables
  (<m>x_0, x_1, x_2, \cdots</m>) so we will define an equivalent, but more
  useful, notation. The basic idea here is that we move to a new point
  a little bit away from <m>x_0</m> and form the quotient that gives the
  slope of the secant line at that point. To construct the first
  secant line we took <m>x_1</m> to be a number a little to the right of
  <m>x_0</m>. However, if we take <m>h</m> to be a positive number near zero
  then <m>x_0+h</m> expresses the same idea.  Similarly, to construct a
  secant line a little to the left of <m>x_0</m> we take <m>h</m> to be a
  negative number near zero so that <m>x_0+h</m> expresses the same idea.
</p>

<image source="images/Secant-h.png" width="50%"/>
<!-- \begin{wrapfigure}[]{r}{2in} -->
<!--   \captionsetup{labelformat=empty} -->
<!--   \vskip-6mm{} -->
<!-- \centerline{\includegraphics*[height=1.2in,width=2in]{../Figures/Secant-h}} -->
<!-- \label{fig:SecantEps1} -->
<!-- \end{wrapfigure} -->
<p>

We can capture both situations notationally by agreeing that <m>h</m> is a
number (either positive or negative) which is close to zero. Thus
when <m>h</m> is positive the
point <m>x_0+h</m> is to the right, and when <m>h</m> is negative the point
<m>x_0+h</m> is to the left of <m>x_0</m> as shown in the diagram at the right.
</p>
<p>

When we express the idea this way we no longer need to generate all of
the independent variables, <m>x_1, x_2, x_3, \ldots</m>. We can accomplish
the same thing by taking <m>x_h=x_0+h,</m> where <m>h</m> is some arbitrary real
number, which is close to zero. 
Each
value of <m>h</m> gives us a different secant line through the point
<m>(x_0,y(x_0)),</m> and its slope will be

<men  xml:id="EQUATIONDefDeriv">
\frac{y(x_0+h)-y(x_0)}{(x_0+h)-x_0}
=\frac{y(x_0+h)-y(x_0)}{h}
<!-- \label{eq:DefDeriv} -->
</men>

By the Principle of Local Linearity we see that when <m>h</m> is very small
the quotient <m>\frac{y(x_0+h)-y(x_0)}{h}</m> will be very close to the the
slope of the tangent line.
</p>
<p>

There is also a small technical matter we need to think about: Do we
really need to consider secant lines on either side of <m>x_0</m> (for both
positive and negative values of <m>h</m>)? Would it not be sufficient to
consider just the secant lines on the right formed from the sequence
<m>x_1=2.1, x_1=2.01, x_1=2.001,\ \ldots?</m> It seems pretty clear that
the slopes we get, <m>4.1, 4.01, 4.001, \ldots</m> are getting closer to
<m>4</m>. Isn't that enough?
</p>
<p>

No, it is not. But not because there is any inherent logical flaw in
doing so. This has more to do with the properties we want the
derivative to have than any purely logical consideration, so we'll
hold off  further discussion until
<xref ref="SECTIONfirst-deriv-test"></xref>.

<p>
Returning to the example  <m>y=x^2</m> at <m>x=2</m>,
we let <m>h</m> be any number except zero and find of the secant line
through <m>(2,4)</m> and <m>(2+h,(2+h)^2)</m>. We can't let <m>h</m> be zero because
if it is zero
then <m>(2,4)</m> and <m>(2+h,(2+h)^2)</m> are the same point and
we can't construct the secant line. We 
<em>must</em> have <m>h\neq0</m> just to
get started. In that case we have

<p>
This is interesting. Do you recognize this computation? It should be
familiar to you. This is precisely the same computation you did when
you used Fermat's adaptation of the Method of Adequality to find
tangent lines in <xref ref="PROBLEMferm-meth-x2"></xref> of
<xref ref="CHAPTERScienceBeforeCalc"></xref>. The only difference, really,
is that at this point Fermat would simply set <m>h=0</m> and move on.  We
can't do that because we need two distinct points to specify a
(secant) line. If <m>h=0</m> we only have one. This is frustrating because
we can see that setting <m>h=0</m> will give us <m>y^\prime(2)=4</m> which we
know to be the correct value.
</p>
<p>
Berkeley pointed out the problem of setting <m>h=0</m> in <pubtitle>The
  Analyst</pubtitle> (his Increments are what we've called <m>h</m>):
</p>
  <blockquote>
<p>    
 .  .  . this reasoning is not fair or conclusive. For
    when it is said, let the Increments vanish, i.e. let the
    Increments be nothing, or let there be no Increments, the former
    Supposition that the Increments were something, or that there were
    Increments is destroyed, and yet as a Consequence of that
    Supposition, i.e. an Expression got by virtue thereof, is
    retained. Which  .  .  . is a false way of reasoning. Certainly
    when we suppose the Increments to vanish, we must suppose their
    Proportions, their Expressions, and every thing else derived from
    the Supposition of their Existence to vanish with them.
</p>
</blockquote>


<p>
Requiring <m>h</m> to be non-zero at the beginning of our argument, and
zero at the end is tantamount to requiring <m>h</m> to be zero and not zero
simultaneously which is not possible.  So <m>h</m> can't be zero. But it
can be very close to zero. Moreover as it gets closer to zero
(<m>h\rightarrow0</m>) it is clear that <m>4+h\rightarrow4</m>.

This should also feel very familiar to you. Do you see that we're
talking about a limit? From <xref ref="EQUATIONsqrslope1">equation</xref> we see that
as  <m>h\rightarrow0</m>, 
<me>
\frac{y(2+h)-y(2)}{h} =  4+h \rightarrow4.
</me>
Moreover, by the Principle of Local Linearity as <m>h\rightarrow0</m> the
secant and tangent lines become indistinguishable.
Thus it appears that  the limit
<me>
\limit{h}{0}{\frac{y(2+h)-y(2)}{h}} =
\limit{h}{0}{\frac{4+4h+h^2-4}{h}} = \limit{h}{0}{4+h}= 4
</me>
will be the value of the derivative, <m>y^\prime(2)</m>, of <m>y(x)</m> at <m>x=2</m>.
</p>


<p>

Our discussion in <xref ref="EXAMPLEy=x^2-limits"></xref> suggests that we can
use the limit concept to finally resolve the logical difficulties
inherent in a naive use of the differential as a foundation for Calculus,
and that is exactly our present goal.
</p>



<aside>
<title>Historical Background</title>

<p>
We say <q>naive</q> because the fact is that
  the differential concept actually can be made fully rigorous and
  thus can serve as a foundation for Calculus just as well as the
  limit theory we are currently pursuing.  Such a foundation was built
  by the
  mathematician
<url href="https://mathshistory.st-andrews.ac.uk/Biographies/Robinson/" visual="https://mathshistory.st-andrews.ac.uk/Biographies/Robinson/">Abraham
    Robinson</url> is his <m>1966</m> book <pubtitle>Non-Standard
    Analysis</pubtitle>. However Robinson used ideas and techniques from modern
  mathematical logic which were not available to mathematicians of the
  seventeenth century. Because they are they are not available to us
  either, we will justify our methods using the older, slightly simpler,
  limit theory.
</p>
</aside>



<p>

In this second part
of this text we will finally build a viable theory  to support
Calculus which even Bishop Berkeley would have to accept. We begin
with the following definition. This is the modern definition of the
derivative.
</p>



<definition xml:id="DEFINITIONDerivative">
<title>The Derivative</title>
<statement>
<p>
  <!-- \label{def:Derivative} -->
  Suppose <m>f</m> is a function, and that <m>x</m> is a real number. If
  <m>\limit{h}{0}{\frac{f(x+h{})-f(x)}{h}}</m> exists then we say that <m>f</m>
  is <term>differentiable</term> at <m>x</m> and that the derivative of <m>f</m> at
  <m>x</m> is given by:

<men  xml:id="EQUATIONDefDerivative">
    f^\prime(x)=\dfdx{f}{x}=\limit{h}{0}{\frac{f(x+h{})-f(x)}{h}}
</men>

  if this limit exists. If the limit does not exist then the
  derivative also  does not exist at <m>x</m>.

</p>
</statement>
</definition>

<p>
<xref ref="DEFINITIONDerivative"></xref> defines the derivative locally, <q>at
<m>x</m>.</q> This may seem to be a mere formality but it is not. When we
write <m>f(x)</m> it is easy to fall into the habit of thinking of <m>x</m> as
representing all of the points in the domain of <m>f</m>.  But that is
fundamentally wrong. The variable <m>x</m> always represents a single point
in the domain of <m>f</m>. Always. No exceptions.  When its value is
unknown we call it  <m>x</m> because this is simpler than saying <q>whatever
point we're interested in.</q>  This is why the symbol <m>f(x)</m> is
pronounced <q><m>f</m> of <m>x</m>,</q> or <q><m>f</m> at <m>x</m>.</q>
</p>


<aside>
<title>Comment</title>

<p>
Or <m>y</m>, or <m>z</m>, or Fred, Ethel, Ricky,
  or Lucy. These are all just names we give to a specific quantity
  which is unknown.
</p>
</aside>


<p>

In  <xref ref="EXAMPLEy=x^2-limits"></xref> we evaluated the
derivative of <m>f(x)=x^2</m> at the single point <m>x=2</m>.  It appears that
if we want to evaluate the derivative of <m>f(x)=x^2</m> at <m>x=3</m> and <m>x=4</m>
we need to compute <m> \tlimit{h}{0}{\frac{f(3+h)-f(3)}{h}}</m>, and
<m> \tlimit{h}{0}{\frac{f(4+h)-f(4)}{h}}</m>.
</p>
<p>

But it is tedious to compute the derivative of a function one specific
point at a time. If we leave <m>x</m> unspecified and compute
<m> f^\prime(x)=\limit{h}{0}{\frac{f(x+h)-f(x)}{h}} </m> we obtain the
value of the derivative of <m>f</m> at the single, but unspecified point
<m>x</m>. We can then find the
derivative of <m>f</m> at any point by replacing <m>x</m> with whatever point we are
interested in.

 If you look closely at <xref ref="DEFINITIONDerivative"></xref> you can see
 Leibniz' differentials lurking in the background\aside{Newton's
   fluxions are nowhere to be seen, however.}. If we let
 <m>\Delta{}y=f(x+h{})-f(x)</m> and <m>\Delta x = h</m> then for values of <m>h</m>
 very close to zero we have.
 <me>
  f^\prime(x) \approx \frac{\Delta y}{\Delta x} =
  \frac{f(x+h{})-f(x)}{h}.
  </me>
  The approximation gets better as <m>\Delta x\rightarrow0</m>
  (equivalently, as <m>h\rightarrow0</m>) so you can see that
  <xref ref="DEFINITIONDerivative"></xref> avoids the infinitely small by
  replacing differentials with <m>\Delta x</m> (equivalently <m>h</m>) which is
  a small, but finite, number which is only considered in the limit as
  <m>\Delta x\rightarrow0</m>. In particular, <m>\Delta x</m> is not an
  infinitesimal. But it is allowed to become as close to zero as
  needed while remaining finite in size.  Needless to say, limits are
  much harder to work with than differentials. Their saving grace is
  if they can be made logically unassailable with a proper
  definition. Bishop Berkeley would approve.
</p>
<p>

  For the rest of this text we pursue two over--arching goals.  The
  first is to rigorously recapture from
  <xref ref="DEFINITIONDerivative"></xref> all of the differentiation rules
  we are already familiar with.  We will address that in the first
  section of the next chapter. Keep in mind that we are not developing
  the differentiation rules. We already know them, and by now you
  should be quite skillful at their use. Our goal now is to show
  rigorously that by using <xref ref="DEFINITIONDerivative"></xref> we
  can recapture all of the properties that we found so useful before.
</p>
<p>

  To do this we will need several properties of limits which we will
  state <mdash/> without proof <mdash/> in the next section. Then we will prove
  that our differentiation rules and the First Derivative Test are
  valid using <xref ref="DEFINITIONDerivative"></xref>. However all of this
  will be done under the assumption that the limit properties in the
  next section are actually true.
</p>
<p>

  Our second goal is to prove, rigorously that the limit properties in
  the next section are actually true. We will do this in
  <xref ref="SECTIONLimitLaws"></xref>.
