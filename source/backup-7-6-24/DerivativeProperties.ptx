      <p>
        Geometry has always been considered as an
        exact science, and indeed as the source of the exactness which is
        widespread among other parts of mathematics. . . But it seems that
        this feature of exactness does not reign anymore in geometry since
        the new system of infinitely small quantities has been mixed to
        it. I do not see that this system has produced anything for the
        truth and it would seem to me that it often conceals
        mistakes.

      Assuming that all of the properties of limits we talked about in
      <xref ref="SECTIONlimit-theorems-laws">Section</xref> can be proved, we have seen that
      all of the differentiation rules we developed intuitively using
      differentials in <xref ref="CHAPTERdifferentials">Chapter</xref> can be made
      rigorous using limits.
    </p>
    <p>

      The question we need to address now is this: Does the need for rigor,
      which prompted our 
      <xref ref="DEFINITIONDerivative">definition of the derivative</xref>),
      get in the way of practical applications such as, say, the First
      Derivative Test? We will show that such a practical result can still
      be achieved while maintaining rigor. To do this, we will need a
      theorem that allows us to relate instantaneous changes to finite
      changes. The French name for this theorem is <q>le théorème des
      accroissements finis</q> (translated literally as <q>the Theorem of
      Finite Increments</q>). In English it is called the the Mean Value
      Theorem. We will see how this powerful theorem can be used to
      transition from theoretical to practical.

      It is actually a little surprising how much effort it takes to prove
      the First Derivative Test.  We will start by proving some
      preliminary results that will make it a little easier to follow the
      logic behind the proof of the First Derivative Test.  We<rsq/>ll begin
      with  (<xref
      ref="THEOREMFermatsTheorem">Fermat<rsq/>s Theorem</xref>) which says that if
      <m>f</m> attains a maximum (or minimum) at <m>x=a</m> then
      <m>f^\prime(a)=0.</m> More formally:
    </p>

    <theorem xml:id="THEOREMFermatsTheorem2">
      <title>Fermat<rsq/>s Theorem</title>
      <idx><h>Theorem</h><h>Fermat<rsq/>s Theorem</h></idx>
      <p>
        If <m>f(a)</m> is a local extremum (either a maximum or a minimum) of
        <m>f(x)</m> at <m>x=a</m>, and <m>f(x)</m> is differentiable at <m>x=a</m> then
        <m>f^\prime(a)=0</m>.
      </p>
    </theorem>
    <p>


      Recall that Fermat<rsq/>gs Theorem does not say that if <m>f^\prime(a)=0</m> then
      <m>f(a)</m> is an extremum. In fact, we know that this is not true.
      Rather, it states the converse: If we know that <m>f(a)</m> is an extremum
      and <m>f^\prime(a)</m> exists, then <m>f^\prime(a) =0</m>.
    </p>
    <p>

      It is very rare that we can develop a proof of a theorem by directly
      writing down the logical steps in order.  Usually the process takes a
      lot of trying, backtracking, trying again, and so on much as we
      described in our analogy in <xref ref="CHAPTERproblem-solving">Chapter</xref> about
      finding your way out of a forest.
    </p>
    <p>

      Of course, in a textbook it is not practical to list all of the bad
      ideas we might have just to see that they are, in fact, bad ideas. So
      we will use the following <alert>Scrapwork</alert> construct when we
      are just <q>thinking about</q> a problem. The scrapwork is not the
      proof. The purpose of scrapwork is to engage our intuition and to
      begin organizing our intuitive understanding so that a rigorous proof
      will emerge. So, not every statement we make inside a scrapwork
      construct will necessarily be fully rigorous. If you see a gap in the
      logic inside a scrapwork construct watch to see how it gets filled in
      the proof.

        Notice that in <xref ref="DEFINITIONDerivative">Definition</xref> the quantity
        <m>\frac{f(a+h)-f(a)}{h}</m> is the slope of a particular secant line, as
        in the sketch below.   
      </p>
      <image source="images/FermatThm1.png" width="50%"/>
      <p>

        If <m>(a,f(a))</m> is a (local) maximum then the slope of the secant
        line in our diagram, <m>\frac{f(a+h)-f(a)}{h}</m>, must be negative
        when <m>h\gt 0</m>. Since the slope is less than zero it follows
        that
        <me>
          f^\prime(a)=\limit{h}{0}{\frac{f(a+h)-f(a)}{h}}\le0.

      We can now rigorously prove Fermat<rsq/>s Theorem.

    <proof>
      <title>Proof of Fermat<rsq/>s Theorem</title>

      <p>
        We will only prove the case when <m>f(a)</m> is a local maximum. The case
        of a local minimum is very similar.
        
        Since <m>f(a)</m> is a local maximum there is an interval containing <m>a</m>
        such that for any <m>h</m> (sufficiently small that <m>a+h</m> is also in the
        interval), <m>f(a+h)\leq f(a)</m>. Thus <m>f(a+h)-f(a)\leq0</m> as seen in the
        sketch above. If <m>h\lt0</m> then <m>\frac{f(a+h)-f(a)}{h}\geq 0</m> and so
        <men  xml:id="EQUATIONRolle1">
          f^\prime(a)=\limit{h}{0}{\frac{f(a+h)-f(a)}{h}}\ge0.
          <!-- \label{eq:Rolle1} -->
        </men>
        However if <m>h\gt0</m> then
        <men xml:id="EQUATIONRolle2">
          f^\prime(a)=\limit{h}{0}{\frac{f(a+h)-f(a)}{h}}\le0.
          <!-- \label{eq:Rolle2} -->
        </men>
        The only way that inequalities in <xref ref="EQUATIONRolle1">Formulas</xref> and <xref ref="EQUATIONRolle2"></xref>) can 
        be both true is if <m>f^\prime(a)=0.</m>

      When Rolle<rsq/>s Lemma is visualized, as in the sketch above, it is
      clear what is going on. If <m>f(a)=f(b)</m> then between the points
      <m>(a,f(a))</m> and <m>(b,f(b))</m> the graph of <m>f(x)</m> will either rise to a maximum
      or drop to a minimum (not shown) at some point <m>c</m>. In either case, by
      Fermat<rsq/>s Theorem, the derivative of <m>f</m> at <m>c</m> will be zero. Notice
      that the slope of the line through <m>(a,f(a))</m> and <m>(b,f(b))</m> is also
      zero. Thus these two lines are parallel.

    <p>

      Despite the clarity of our sketch, an analytic proof is still
      required because our sketch does not capture all of the possible ways
      that Rolle<rsq/>s Lemma  can manifest. This is demonstrated in

    <proof>
      <title>Proof of Roll<rsq/>s Lemma</title>
      <p>
        By the <xref ref="THEOREMmax-min"> Extreme Value Theorem</xref> there are points 
        <m>\alpha</m> and <m>\beta</m> in the interval <m>[a,b]</m>, such that  <m>f(\alpha)</m> is a global
        maximum, and  <m>f(\beta)</m> is a global minimum.
        
        There are two possibilities for <m>\alpha</m> and <m>\beta</m>:
        
        <dl>
          <li>
            <title>Case 1:</title>
            <p>
              <alert>Both <m>\alpha</m> and <m>\beta</m> are endpoints of the
              interval.</alert>
            </p>
            <p>
              In this case since <m>f(a)=f(b)</m> the global maximum
              and the global minimum are equal. The only way that can happen is
              if the function is constant on the interval <m>[a,b]</m>, and if <m>f</m> is
              constant then <m>f^\prime(x)=0</m> for every <m>x</m> in the interval
              <m>(a,b)</m>. So we take
              <m>c</m> to be any point in <m>(a,b)</m>.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <title> Case 2:</title>
            <p>
              <alert>At least one of <m>\alpha</m> or <m>\beta</m> is not an
              endpoint of the interval.</alert>
            </p>
            <p>
              In this case by Fermat<rsq/>s Theorem,
              either <m>f^\prime(\alpha)=0</m>, or <m>f^\prime(\beta)=0</m>. So we take
              <m>c=\alpha</m> or <m>c=\beta</m> as appropriate.
            </p>
          </li>
        </dl>

        In either case the existence of <m>c</m> in the interval <m>(a,b)</m>, with
        <m>f^\prime(c)=0</m> is guaranteed.

          Technically
          speaking, a statement is not a theorem until it has actually been
          proved. Until then it is a conjecture.

      <p>
        The distinction between a theorem and a lemma is very slight and
        rather arbitrary. Typically we call a statement a theorem if it is important
        and requires proof. We call it a lemma if it requires proof itself,
        and is used to simply the proof of a theorem.  This is not a
        hard-and-fast rule by any means. Sometimes we first prove a lemma as
        an aid to proving a theorem, only to find that the lemma is actually
        more important. However, having been originally dubbed a lemma the
        result is known ever after as a lemma.  For example, in the present
        instance we will be using the Extreme Value, and Fermat<rsq/>s <em>Theorems</em> to prove
        what often called Rolle<rsq/>s <em>Lemma</em>, and then use use Rolle<rsq/>s
        <em>Lemma</em> to prove the Mean Value <em>Theorem</em>.  Then we will use
        the Mean Value <em>Theorem</em> to prove the First Derivative <em>Test</em>. It is all
        very chaotic.

          We will not be
          proving the Extreme Value Theorem in this text. Although it appears
          to be obviously true (read it again and see), it is remarkably hard
          to prove in a fully rigorous fashion. If you feel that you must see
          the proof you should change your major to mathematics and take a
          course in Real Analysis.

        The Mean Value Theorem (visualized below) says that there is a
        point <m>c</m>, in the interval <m>(a,b)</m> such that the tangent line at <m>c</m>
        and the line through <m>(a,f(a)</m> and <m>(b,f(b))</m> are parallel. Thus in
        the special case where <m>f(a)=f(b)</m> the Mean Value Theorem reduces to
        Rolle<rsq/>s Lemma.  In other words the Mean Value Theorem is a
        generalization of Rolle<rsq/>s Lemma.

      As we mentioned at the beginning of this chapter in French the Mean
      Value Theorem is known as the <foreign>théorème des accroissements
      finis</foreign> or literally the <q>theorem of the finite increments.</q>
    </p>
    <p>

      To see why this is an accurate description let <m>y=f(x)</m>. Then
      <m>f(b)-f(a) = \Delta y</m> and <m>b-a=\Delta x</m>. So we can re-express
      <xref ref="EQUATIONMVT">equation</xref>) as <m>\Delta y=f^\prime(c)\Delta x</m>. In this
      form it is clear that the Mean Value Theorem relates the finite
      increments <m>\Delta y</m> and <m>\Delta x</m> to the instantaneous rate of
      change <m>f^\prime(c)</m>.
    </p>
    <p>

      The English name, <q>Mean Value Theorem</q> comes from interpreting the
      derivative as an instantaneous velocity. If <m>t</m> represents time and
      <m>p(t)</m> represents position at time <m>t</m>, then <m>\frac{p(b)-p(a)}{b-a}</m>
      is the average velocity in the time interval <m>[a,b]</m>. Since
      <m>p^\prime(c)</m> is instantaneous velocity at time <m>c</m>, the conclusion of
      the Mean Value Theorem is that at some point in that interval,
      instantaneous velocity must match average (mean) velocity. For
      example, if you travel <m>50</m> miles in one hour then your average
      velocity is <m>50\frac{\text{miles}}{\text{hour}}</m>. But it is unlikely
      that you traveled at exactly <m>50\frac{\text{miles}}{\text{hour}}</m> for
      the entire hour. However, at one instant (possibly more) you had to have
      been traveling at exactly <m>50\frac{\text{miles}}{\text{hour}}</m>. This
      is the Mean Value Theorem. It provides the bridge we need to get from
      infinitesimals to finite intervals.

        We want to use the Mean Value Theorem  on the interval <m>[a,b]</m> so we begin by
        verifying that the conditions of the Mean Value Theorem  are
        satisfied on that interval.  
        Observe that <m>[a,b]</m> is a subinterval of <m>[\alpha,\beta]</m> so <m>f(x)</m>
        is continuous on <m>[a,b]</m> and differentiable on <m>(a,b)</m>.
        
        By the Mean Value Theorem there is a number, <m>c</m>, in the interval <m>(a,b)</m> such that
        <md>
          <mrow>
            \frac{f(b)-f(a)}{b-a} \amp= f^\prime(c)
          </mrow>
          <mrow>
            f(b)-f(a) \amp= f^\prime(c)(b-a).
          </mrow>
        </md>

        Since both  <m>b-a\gt 0</m> and <m>f^\prime(c)\gt 0</m> are
        positive, <m>f(b)-f(a)</m> must be positive as well. Therefore
        <me>f(b)-f(a) \gt  0 \text{ or } 
        f(b)\gt f(a).</me>

      While we are in this frame of mind, we<rsq/>ll take a moment to notice that
      we can use the Mean Value Theorem  to prove, rigorously, something that we have
      alluded to a few times but have never addressed directly.  It is clear
      from our differentiation rules that if two functions differ by a
      constant, then they have the same derivative.  We<rsq/>ve mentioned that
      the converse is true, namely if two functions have the same derivative
      on an interval then they must differ by a constant. %  For example, see
      This can be proved in a
      manner similar to the proof above.
