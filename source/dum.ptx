Another optimization problem that we can solve without Calculus (this
time we'll use Algebra) is the following.


\begin{myexample}[Maximizing Area]
  \label{ex:fixed-perimeter}
  Out of all rectangles with a given fixed perimeter, which one
  encompasses the greatest area?
  
  A reasonable guess is that the correct shape is a square. But a
  guess, no matter how much it feels right, is just a guess. We need a
  convincing demonstration.
  
  To see that this actually is the correct shape, consider a square
  whose side is $s.$ If $s$ is the length of one side then the
  perimeter of our square is (the fixed value) $4s$ and the area is
  $s^2$ (also fixed). Suppose we now increase of two opposite sides
  the length by $x.$ To maintain the same perimeter, we must now
  decrease the width by the same $x.$ The area of this new rectangle
  is $(s-x) \times (s+x)$ is $(s-x)(s+x)=s^2-x^2\lt{}s^2$ but its
  perimeter is still $4s.$
  
  Thus the square has a larger area than this rectangle with the same
  perimeter. Moreover, since we didn't specify a value for $x$ our
  conclusion holds for all possible values of $x$. That is, every
  rectangle with perimeter $4s$ has a smaller area than the square
  with perimeter $4s$.
\end{myexample}

\pagebreak[4]
\begin{Digression}[Variables, Constants, and Functions]
  \label{digress:VarConFun}{}
  It is easy to have the impression that using a letter, like $s$, to
  represent quantity automatically means that the quantity can vary --
  that it is ``variable.'' This is not true.  There are three
  situations in which which a letter is used to represent a given
  quantity.
  
  \begin{description}
  \item [Variables:] For example, the area of a square is given by
    $A=x^2,$ where $x$ is the length of one side.  If we think of $x$
    as a \term{variable} --- if it can take on any positive value ---
    then this expression gives us the area of all possible squares.
  \item[Constants:] Sometimes letters are used to designate unchanging
    quantities --- \term{constants} (also called \term{parameters})
    --- when the actual value of the constant is irrelevant. For
    example, the area of all rectangles where one side is some fixed
    value, say $c$, but the other varies is given by $A = c\cdot x,$
    where $x$ is variable as before. Since we don't care what the size
    of the fixed side is we don't choose a specific length for it. We
    just let $c$ represent that fixed size, whatever it is.  The
    crucial fact here is that we have a rectangle, not what size the
    rectangle is.
    
    The difference between \term{variables} and \term{constants} is
    mostly in the way we think about them. Constants are fixed, but
    unknown. Variables are not fixed.
  \item[Functions:] Sometimes a varying quantity depends on the values
    of one or more other varying quantities. In that case the
    dependent variable is said to be a \term{function} of the
    independent variable. We saw this above when we said the area of a
    rectangle with a fixed side length, $c$, was
    $$
    A=c\cdot x.
    $$
    Most often we would write this as
    $$
    A(x)=c\cdot x.
    $$
    The ``$(x)$'' part of ``$A(x)$'' just tells us that what the
    dependent variable $A$ depends on is the independent
    variable\aside{If you are inclined to be persnickety, you can make
      a reasonable argument that if $A(x)=cx$ then $A$ depends on both
      $c$ and $x$. And you'd be right. But the tradition is to only
      put variables inside the parentheses, not parameters.} $x$.
    % The name we give to the dependent variable ( $A$ in this case)
    % usually serves double duty as both the name of the dependent
    % variable, and the name of are also sometimes called
    % functions. In this example $A$ is a \emph{function} of $x$.
    
  \end{description}
  These are simple distinctions now, but it will be useful for you to
  get in the habit of making sure it is clear in your mind what is
  variable, what is constant, and which variables are functions of
  other variables. As the problems get more complex and we need
  several variables, parameters, and functions, just untangling all of
  this can become problematic. Keep in mind that the distinction is
  purely in how we choose to ``think about'' a given symbol, not in
  how we manipulate it algebraically.

The following problem is a variation on
Example~\#\ref{ex:fixed-perimeter} and can be solved similarly.

<problem xml:id="prob:science-before-calc-1">

  <!-- \label{prob:science-before-calc-1} -->
  Out of all rectangles with a fixed perimeter, which one has the
  shortest diagonal?  Justify your answer.
\end{embeddedproblem-1line}

As we mentioned above, Problem~\ref{prob:science-before-calc-1} can be
done in a manner similar to Example~\ref{ex:fixed-perimeter}.  But
what about the following?

\begin{myexample}
  \label{prob:science-before-calc-2}
  Consider all square based boxes with a fixed surface area $S.$ Does
  the cube enclose the largest volume?
  
  To do this problem in the same manner as
  Example~\ref{ex:fixed-perimeter}, observe that a cube with side $s$
  would have a volume of $s^3$ and a surface area of $6s^2$. Suppose
  we change the lengths on the base from $s$ to $s+x$.  Notice that if
  $x\gt0$ then we will be increasing the lengths on the base and if
  $x\lt0$ then we will be decreasing the lengths.  The only
  restriction is that $0\lt s+x$ so as to be a length.  This says that
  $-s\lt x\lt\infty$. (In theory, we can make the lengths of the base
  as long as we wish.)  To maintain a surface area of $6s^2$, we will
  need to adjust our height appropriately.  Let’s call this new height
  $h$.
  
  \begin{embeddedproblem}
    \label{problem:MaximalCube1}
    Proceed as in Example~\ref{prob:science-before-calc-2} to show
    that in order to maintain a surface area of $6s^2$, $h$ must be
    $ h=\frac{s^2-sx-\frac{x^2}{2}}{s+x}$. Use this to show that the
    volume of this new box is
    $$
    V=s^3-x^2\left(s+\frac{s+x}{2}\right).
    $$
    How does this address the original question about the cube having
    the largest volume? \\
    \hint{ Why did we write $V$ in this rather peculiar way.}
  </p>
</statement>
</problem>
\end{myexample}

Problem~\ref{problem:MaximalCube1} shows that proceeding in this
\foreign{ad hoc} manner is becoming more difficult.  Difficulties of
this kind are what prompted mathematicians in the seventeenth century
to search for more systematic methods for handling such optimization.
These techniques ultimately led to the invention of Calculus.  We’ll
come back to the this problem later in this chapter.

In its simplest form an \term{Optimization Problem} can be described
as follows: Given that $y$ depends on $x$, find the value of $x$ that
makes $y$ as large (or as small) as it can possibly be.

For example, if $y=x^2-\frac{29}{21}x+\frac{10}{21}$ then $y$ will be
as small as it can possibly be when $x=\frac{29}{42}$. The question
is, how did we find $x=\frac{29}{42}$?

One of the mathematicians who developed techniques for solving
optimization problems
was
\href{https://mathshistory.st-andrews.ac.uk/Biographies/Fermat/}{Pierre
  de Fermat} ($1601-1665$) who created what has been called the
\emph{Method of Adequalty}. Fermat's\aside{His name is pronounced
  ``fair mah'', not ``fur mat''.} method was based on the simple
observation that if the maximum value of $y$ occurs when $x$ is equal
to say, $6$, then when $x$ is very near $6$, $y$ will almost be equal
to its maximum value.

\begin{wrapfigure}[14]{r}{3.5in}

  \label{fig:SantaBarbaraDaylight1}
\end{wrapfigure}
You can see this in the graph at the right\aside{Since there is only
  one number associated with each day of the year this should be a
  discrete graph. Since we'll be more interested in continuous
  functions we connect the dots to create a continuous
  approximation.}.  Notice that the maximum number of daylight hours
(about $14.5$) occurs just after $169$ days (in fact, at day $172$)
and that for several days before or after we have about the same
number of hours of daylight.  This is also true near the minimum which
occurs at day $356.$ Regardless of what the variables represent if the
graph of a function, $f(x)$, is continuous the near a maximum or
minimum: $f(x+h)\approx f(x)$ as long as $h$ is not too big.

Fermat's simple idea was to purposely make the mistake of setting
$f(x+h)$ actually equal\aside{The Latin root \foreign{adaequ\={a}re}
  means to equalize.  When something is adequate, then it is equal to
  the need.} to $f(x)$.  He then rearranged the formulas algebraically
and at the crucial point he would set $h=0$ to ``make it correct.''
An example will make this clearer.

\pagebreak[4]

\begin{myexample}
  \label{example:SquareMinimalPerimeter}
  % \vskip-.3in{}
  \begin{wrapfigure}[5]{r}{1.6in}
    \vskip-5mm{} \captionsetup{labelformat=empty}

  \end{wrapfigure}
  In Example~\ref{ex:fixed-perimeter}, we showed that out of all
  rectangles with a fixed perimeter, the one with the largest area is
  a square. Next we will use Fermat's Method of Adequality to examine
  the related question: Out of all rectangles with a fixed area, does
  a square have the smallest perimeter?
  
  Consider a rectangle whose length is given by $x$ and width is given
  by $y.$ The area of the rectangle is given by $A=xy$ and the
  perimeter is given by $P=2x+2y.$
  
  The problem is to minimize $P$ while holding $A$ constant. More
  precisely, our objective is to minimize the function $P=2x+2y$,
  subject to the constraint that the area, $A=xy$, is fixed. First, we
  will use our constraint $A=xy$ to eliminate one of the variables and
  substitute into $P$. Solving for $y,$ we get $y=A/x.$ Then,
  $$
  P=P(x) = 2x+\frac{2A}{x}.
  $$
  We have used function notation for $P(x)$ to emphasize that $P$ is a
  function of $x$ alone.  (Remember that $A$ is constant or
  ``fixed.'')
  
  Fermat's method says to first set
  $$
  P(x+h)=P(x).
  $$
  This gives:
  \begin{align}
    2(\textcolor{red}{x}+h)+\frac{2A}{x+h}=2\textcolor{red}{x}+\frac{2A}{x}.\label{equation:FermAd1}\\
    \intertext{  Rearranging a bit, we get}
    \nonumber
    \textcolor{red}{2x}+\textcolor{blue}{2}h+\frac{\textcolor{blue}{2}A}{x+h}&=\textcolor{red}{2x}+\frac{\textcolor{blue}{2}A}{x}
    \\
    \intertext{so that}
    \nonumber h&=\frac{A}{x}-\frac{A}{x+h}. \\
    \intertext{Adding the fractions gives}
    h&=\frac{A(x+h)-Ax}{x(x+h)}=\frac{Ah}{x(x+h)}. \label{equation:FermAd6}\\
    \intertext{Finally, and crucially, dividing both sides   by $h,$ gives}   
    1&=\frac{A}{x(x+h)}.\label{equation:FermAd7}
  \end{align}
  
  Earlier we had made the ``mistake'' of setting $P(x+h)=P(x)$
  (knowing that this is not true). Now we ``make it correct'' by
  setting $h=0$. This gives: $ 1=\frac{A}{x^2}, \text{ or } x^2=A.  $
  Substituting this into $y=\frac{A}{x},$ we get
  $y=\frac{A}{x}=\frac{x^2}{x}=x.$
  
  Thus $P$ is minimum when $y=x,$ which is to say, when the rectangle
  is actually a square. A moment's thought should make it clear that
  there is no maximum value for $P.$
  
  
  Fermat's method is very slick.  However it contains an inherent
  logical flaw.  We begin by setting $P(x+h)$ equal to $P(x)$, even
  though we know we are making an error. This seems like it might be a
  flaw but it really isn't. When we set $P(x+h)=P(x)$ we are asking,
  ``What happens if they are equal?'' The computations leading up to
  equation~(\ref{equation:FermAd7}) are the answer to that question.
  
  But notice that we got from equation~(\ref{equation:FermAd6}) to
  equation~(\ref{equation:FermAd7}) by dividing by $h.$ From
  arithmetic you know that you can only divide by $h$ if $h$ is not
  zero. Fortunately it is clear that $h\ne0$ since the whole point of
  introducing $h$ is for $x+h$ and $x$ to be two different values.
  However, in the final step, after Equation~(\ref{equation:FermAd7}),
  we took $h=0$ to ``make it correct'' but if $h$ is zero then we
  couldn't have divided by $h$. We seem to be chasing our tails. We
  need for $h$ to be equal to zero and not be equal to zero at the
  same time!
  
  This is the logical flaw.
  
  Since we began with the assumption that $h\neq0$ we can't just
  change our minds later. We can't have both $h=0$ and $h\neq0$.
\end{myexample}

Despite this logical flaw, Fermat's technique does seem to produce the
correct answer. So let's explore it and see what happens.

\begin{ProficiencyDrill}
  \label{drill:MethAdeq}
  Apply Fermat's Method of Adequality to find all maxima or minima of
  the following functions.  In each case examine a graph the function
  to see if Fermat's Method provides the correct answer.
  \begin{enumerate}[label={\bf{}(\alph*)}]
    \begin{multicols}{3}
    \item $f(x)=x(100-x)$
    \item $q(x) = x^2-2x+4$
    \item $g(x)=x^4-4x^3+6x^2-4x$
    \end{multicols}
  \end{enumerate}
\end{ProficiencyDrill}
Drill~\#\ref{drill:MethAdeq} shows that Fermat's method does not
indicate whether the computed value of $x$ is at a maximum or a
minimum. Often the context of the problem provides the additional
information needed to make that
determination. Example~\#\ref{example:SquareMinimalPerimeter} and
Problem~\#\ref{problem:RectSolid} both provide such a context.

\begin{embeddedproblem}{}
  \label{problem:RectSolid}
  \begin{wrapfigure}[]{r}{1in}

    constraint? Use Fermat's Method of Adequality to find the
    dimensions of the box that solves this problem. Is the minimal box
    a cube?
  \end{enumerate}
\end{embeddedproblem}


A few minutes of thought should convince you that what makes Fermat's
method work is the fact that near a maximum or minimum, the curve is
practically horizontal. That is, its slope is nearly zero.

Fermat recognized that finding a maximum or minimum by his method was
a special case of finding the slope of (the line tangent to) the curve
and he modified his method to determine the slope of a curve even when
it is not horizontal.

Before we pursue Fermat's modification, it might be a good time to
brush up on some basics regarding the slopes of lines.  No doubt you
are already familiar with all of the following formulas for the
equation of a line:
\begin{center}
  \begin{minipage}{.85\linewidth}
    \begin{description}
    \item[\bf Slope-Intercept formula:] $y=mx+b$
    \item[\bf Point-Slope formula:] $y-y_0=m(x-x_0)$
    \item[\bf Two-Point, or Point-Point formula:]
      $y-y_0=\dfrac{y_1-y_0}{x_1-x_0}(x-x_0)$
    \end{description}
  \end{minipage}
\end{center}

These formulas are all really just rearrangements of one another. We
use three different rearrangements because in different contexts one
of them is usually simpler to use than the others. Through most of
Calculus you will probably find the Point-Slope version to be the most
convenient to use.

Now that you've had a chance to brush up on slopes, let's see how
Fermat modified his method to determine the slope of a
curve\aside{That is to say, the slope of the line tangent to the
  curve.}.  We will start by determining the slope of the graph of
$y=x^2$ at the point $(1,1).$

We need two points to determine the slope of a line, so with Fermat's
method in mind, we choose another point on the curve $y=x^2$ very
close to $(1,1).$ Since we don't really care which point we take as
long as it is close to $(1,1)$ we introduce the parameter, $h,$ which
we think of as very small. The points $(1,1)$ and $(1+h,(1+h)^2)$ are
thus very close together. This is represented in the sketch at the
right.

The slope of secant line joining $(1,1)$ and $(1+h,(1+h)^2)$ is given
by

As before we set $h=0$. Thus the slope of the line tangent to the

  \label{fig:Descartes}
  \caption{\centerline{Ren\'e{} Descartes}\\ \centerline{1596-1650}}
\end{wrapfigure}
As we noted earlier, while Fermat's Method of Adequality seems to work
it has a fundamental logical flaw. Fermat's
contemporary,
\href{https://mathshistory.st-andrews.ac.uk/Biographies/Descartes/}{Ren\'e{}
  Descartes} $(1596-1650)$, provided an alternative method in his
book
\href{https://www.maa.org/press/periodicals/convergence/mathematical-treasures-rene-descartes-treatise-on-method}{\pubtitle{Discourse
    on Method}} which is free of logical issues.  Unfortunately
Descartes' technique is also very difficult to use and as we will see
is of limited applicability.

Descartes's method is often called the Method of Normals\aside{The
  English word, ``normal'' comes from the Latin word \foreign{norma}
  which literally means a carpenter's square. In construction, it is
  important that vertical posts be perpendicular to the horizontal
  ground, so a vertical post is normal.}  because what he actually
finds is the line normal to (perpendicular to) a curve.  Once the line
normal to the curve at a point is obtained, the line perpendicular to
the normal line will be tangent to the curve.  Descartes' Method
relies solely on the fact (from Greek Geometry) that at each point of
a circle the radius and tangent line through the point are
perpendicular.  We'll illustrate Descartes' idea with the following
example.

\begin{wrapfigure}[12]{r}{2.3in}
  \vskip-4mm{} \captionsetup{labelformat=empty}
  \centerline{\includegraphics*[height=2in,width=2.3in]{../Figures/DescartesCircle}}
  % \centerline{\includegraphics*[height=2.75in,width=3.16in]{../Figures/DescartesCircle}}
  \label{fig:DescartesCircle2}
\end{wrapfigure}
\begin{myexample}
  \label{ex:DescartesNormal1}
  To find the slope of the normal (and, eventually the tangent) line
  to the graph of the curve $y=\sqrt{2x}$ at the point $(2,2)$
  Descartes' approach was to look at the family of circles with
  centers on the $x$-axis and passing through the point $(2,2).$ The
  sketch at the right displays several members of of that family of
  circles.  Notice that each circle crosses the parabola at the point
  $(2,2)$. We are searching for the center of the solid black circle
  which touches (is tangent to) the parabola at $(2,2)$. If we can
  find the center of the black circle then the radial line through the
  point $(2,2)$ will be normal to the parabola at $(2,2)$ and the
  slope of the tangent line will be the negative reciprocal of the
  slope of the normal.
  
  We now want to turn the geometric problem of finding the
  intersection of our circle and parabola into an algebraic problem.
  Let $(a,0)$ denote the coordinates of the center of a circle in that
  family, then the equation of the circle with center $(a,0)$ is
  $(x-a)^2+y^2=r^2$ where $r$ is the length of the radius of the
  circle and $a$ is a parameter. Since we require our circle to pass
  through the point $(2,2)$ the length of this radius will be the
  distance from $(2,2)$ to $(a,0)$, $r=\sqrt{(2-a)^2+2^2}.$ Thus we
  have
  \begin{equation}
    (x-a)^2+y^2=(2-a)^2+2^2.\label{eq:Descartes1}
  \end{equation}
  
  Since we are looking for the point where $y=\sqrt{2x}$ and the
  circle intersect, we substitute $y=\sqrt{2x}$ into
  Equation~(\ref{eq:Descartes1}) to get
  \begin{align}
    \nonumber  (x-a)^2+2x&=(2-a)^2+4\\
    \nonumber  x^2-2ax+a^2+2x&=4-4a+a^2+4\\
    x^2+(2-2a)x+(4a-8)&=0.\label{eq:NormQuad}
  \end{align}
  
  At this point it is tempting to use the Quadratic Formula to solve
  for $x$ and get (typically) two distinct solutions for $x$ in terms
  of $a$. But the fact is we really don't care about the variable
  $x$. We want to find the value of $a$ which ensures that the circle
  and the curve intersect exactly once.
  
  Think about this for a moment. We get a single solution when we use
  the Quadratic Formula to solve this equation precisely when the
  discriminant (the part under the square root) is zero.
  
  
  \begin{ProficiencyDrill}
    \label{drill:HuddeDiscriminant}
    Use the Quadratic Formula to show that the discriminant of
    Equation~(\ref{eq:NormQuad}) is $(2-2a)^2-4(4a-8)$.
  \end{ProficiencyDrill}
  Setting the discriminant in Drill~\ref{drill:HuddeDiscriminant}
  equal to zero and solving, we get
  \begin{align*}
    4-8a+4a^2-16a+32&=0\\
    4(a^2-6a+9)&=0\\
    4(a-3)^2&=0. \\
    a&=3,
  \end{align*}
  So the center of the circle touching the curve only once is at
  $(3, 0)$ and the line segment from $(3,0)$ to $(2,2)$ is normal
  (perpendicular) to the graph of $y=\sqrt{2x}$.
  
  Descartes and Fermat are generally credited with the invention of
  Analytic Geometry which is a technique that allows us to move
  problems from Algebra to Geometry or, as in this problem, from
  Geometry to Algebra.
  
  
  \pagebreak[4]
  \begin{embeddedproblem}
    Descartes would not have approached this problem using the idea of
    a discriminant as we just did.  He knew that the only way the
    circle and the parabola could be tangent at $x=2$ is if $2$ is a
    double root of Equation~(\ref{eq:NormQuad}).  Since a quadratic
    polynomial only has two roots, this means that
    Equation~(\ref{eq:NormQuad}) must be
    \begin{equation}
      (x-2)^2=0=x^2-4x+4.
      \label{eq:DoubleRoot1}
    \end{equation}
    By comparing the coefficients of Equation~(\ref{eq:NormQuad}) and
    the right side of Equation~(\ref{eq:DoubleRoot1}) show that $a=3$.
  \end{embeddedproblem}
  
  Like any powerful tool, Analytic Geometry must be used
  carefully. Sometimes, as in this problem, the transition from
  Geometry to Algebra can generate algebraic solutions that have no
  corresponding geometric solution. An extraneous root is the most
  common example of this.
  
  
  \begin{embeddedproblem}[Extraneous Roots]
    Show that the roots of $ x^2+(2-2a)x+(4a-8)=0$ are $x=2$ and
    $x=2a-4$. Notice that when $a\ge2$ and $a\ne3$ we the parabola and
    circle will have two intersection points (as seen in the graph in
    Example~\ref{ex:DescartesNormal1}).  When $a\lt{}2$ we get one
    positive and one negative root, but the parabola and the circle
    cross only at $(2,2)$. How do we make peace with this
    apparent contradiction?\\
    \hint{Look closely at the equation for the parabola. Can $x$ be
      negative? }
  \end{embeddedproblem}
  
  Example~\ref{ex:DescartesNormal1} illustrates that there is a
  significant difference between curves touching (curves that are
  tangent) and curves crossing (curves that intersect). Finding the
  line tangent to a curve is actually much more subtle than you would
  expect at first. But this is not the appropriate place to start that
  conversation so we will hold off until we reach
  Section~\ref{sec:veloc-slop-tang}.
  
  
  \begin{ProficiencyDrill}
    \label{prob:DescartesNormals2}
    Now that we've found the center of the circle tangent to the curve
    $y=\sqrt{2x}$ at $(2,2)$, use this to find the equation of the
    lines normal and tangent to the curve at that point.  Plot the
    curve and these two lines on the same set of axes to see if they
    really are normal and tangent to the curve.

Descartes' Method, unlike Fermat's, is free of the logical pitfalls.
But it is algebraically cumbersome because it requires that we find
the ``double root'' of a polynomial. Double roots of quadratic
functions like the one in Example~\#\ref{ex:DescartesNormal1} are
relatively easy to find. But for higher degree polynomials this can be
a substantial problem. For transcendental functions like $y=1-\cos(x)$
this problem is almost insurmountable without Calculus.
% Is it obvious to you that $x=0$ is a double root of
% $y(x)=1-\cos(x)$? Is it even clear what that might mean in this
% context?

\label{sec:roberv-conic-sect}
\markright{\sc{}Roberval, Conic Sections, and the Dynamic Approach}

\subsection*{Speed, Velocity, and Rates of Change}
Descartes and Fermat were co-creators of Analytic Geometry -- the use
of Algebra to solve geometric problems -- so their methods are
simultaneously algebraic and geometric in nature. That is, their
methods are static. There is no motion involved.  But at it's heart,
Calculus gives us a way of dealing with the properties of objects as
they change. It is the mathematics of motion. So we will need to think
more dynamically.

If quantity $A$ changes by $\Delta A$ each time quantity $B$ changes
by $\Delta B$ we say that the rate of change of $A$ \term{with respect
  to} $B$ is $\frac{\Delta A}{\Delta B}$.

For example, in a video game if your character gains one hundred hit
points whenever you cast a certain spell we would say that the rate of
change of your hit points is one hundred points per spell, denoted
$100 \frac{\text{points}}{\text{spell}}$. If you gain fifty hit points
every second time you quaff a potion we write
$\frac{50\ \text{points}}{2\ \text{quaffs}}$ or, equivalently,
$25 \frac{\text{points}}{\text{quaff}}$ and we say that the rate of
change of hit points with respect to quaffs is twenty-five. Notice how
naturally the properties of fractions come into play:
$\frac{50\ \text{points}}{2\ \text{quaffs}} = 25
\frac{\text{points}}{\text{quaff}}$.



On the other hand if you lose $15$ hit points each time an enemy
strikes you three times with a sword then your hit points are
decreasing at a rate of
$\frac{15\ \text{points}}{3\ \text{strikes}} = 5
\frac{\text{points}}{\text{strike}}$. % Notice that the number of hit
It is inconvenient to specify whether $A$ is increasing or decreasing
verbally so we adopt the convention that a negative rate of change is
decreasing and a positive rate of change is increasing.

Speed is the rate of change we are most familiar with in daily life.
If you are driving on a flat, straight, road your speed is the
\term{rate of change} of your position, $\Delta x$, \term{with respect
  to} the passage (change) of time, $\Delta t$.  If your speedometer
reads $60$ we say your speed is sixty miles per hour:\aside{At least
  that's what we say in the United States. In most of the rest of the
  world it means your speed is sixty kilometers per hour:
  $60 \frac{\text{kilometers}}{\text{hour}}$, or $60$ kph.}
$60 \frac{\text{miles}}{\text{hour}}$, meaning of course that in one
hour you will travel sixty miles. This is often abbreviated to $60$
mph. We will model a flat, straight, road as the $x$-axis with the
positive direction to the right, as is customary. Of course, on this
flat, straight, road we could be going
$60 \frac{\text{miles}}{\text{hour}}$ to the right or to the
left. Since there are only two directions possible, we can again use
negative numbers to indicate the direction of travel as depicted in
the sketch below.
\centerline{\includegraphics*[height=.8in,width=3in]{../Figures/Vector2}}

However if we are on a broad flat plain, as depicted in the sketch
below:\\
\centerline{\includegraphics*[height=2.9in,width=2.8in]{../Figures/Vector1}}
we can travel in any direction whatsoever. Notice that our sketch
indicates that there are eight cars, all traveling at
$60 \frac{\text{miles}}{\text{hour}}$, but in different
directions. That is, the \term{speed} of each car is
$60 \frac{\text{miles}}{\text{hour}}$. But it should be clear that a
single number is not adequate to fully describe the motion of these
cars. We also need to specify the direction of travel and simply using
plus or minus is no longer sufficient.

When we specify the speed and direction of motion of some object we
are stating its \term{velocity}. This can be difficult at first
because in casual conversation we use the words speed and velocity
interchangeably, so we tend to think of them as synonyms.  But in a
technical setting speed and velocity, while related, have different
meanings. \term{Speed} is how fast we're going. In the sketch at the
left the speed of all of the cars is
$60 \frac{\text{miles}}{\text{hour}}$. But their \term{velocities} are
all different. The velocity of one car is
$60 \frac{\text{miles}}{\text{hour}}$ to the north, the velocity of
another is $60 \frac{\text{miles}}{\text{hour}}$ to the west, the
velocity of a third is $60 \frac{\text{miles}}{\text{hour}}$ to the
southeast, and so on.

\href{https://mathshistory.st-andrews.ac.uk/Biographies/Roberval/}{Gilles
  Personne de Roberval} $(1602-1675)$, a contemporary of Fermat and
Descartes, used arrows to indicate the velocity of moving objects just
as we have. The length of the arrow represents the speed of the object
and the direction of travel is the direction that the arrow
points. This works well in the kind of geometric arguments he used as
it enabled him to develop a method for constructing tangents which is
dynamic in nature.

Suppose you are on a moving sidewalk like those in an airport and the
sidewalk is moving at $3 \frac{\text{feet}}{\text{second}}$.  If you
stand still on the sidewalk then you are still moving at
$3 \frac{\text{feet}}{\text{second}}$.\\
\centerline{\includegraphics*[height=.75in,width=2in]{../Figures/Arrows1}}

If you are walking along the sidewalk at
$4 \frac{\text{feet}}{\text{second}}$ and in the same direction the
sidewalk is moving then it is pretty clear that you
are moving at a rate of $7 \frac{\text{feet}}{\text{second}}$.\\
\centerline{\includegraphics*[height=1.2in,width=3.3in]{../Figures/Arrows2}}
Of course, if you turn around and walk against the sidewalk, then
your speed  would be $1 \frac{\text{foot}}{\text{second}}$.\\
\centerline{\includegraphics*[height=1.2in,width=2.8in]{../Figures/Arrows3}}
If you are walking against the sidewalk but slower than the sidewalk
is moving, say at $2 \frac{\text{feet}}{\text{second}}$, then you are
again moving at
$1 \frac{\text{foot}}{\text{second}}$ but in the other direction.\\
\centerline{\includegraphics*[height=1.2in,width=2.4in]{../Figures/Arrows4}}

Since there are only two possible directions all this could have been
done without arrows by just adding signed numbers where the sign
indicates the direction: $3+ 4=7$, $3+(-4)=-1$, $3+(-2) =1$, but what
if there are more directions available?

Using arrows allows us to bring this discussion into a more general
setting. In the examples above notice that the resulting velocity (the
black arrow) was always obtained by attaching the tail of the green or
red arrow to the head of the blue arrow.


This works equally well if more directions are available, like when we
are moving in a plane instead of a straight line.

For example, suppose we are swimming across a river at a speed of
$ 2 \frac{\text{feet}}{\text{second}} $ and the river is flowing at
$3 \frac{\text{feet}}{\text{second}}$.  Assuming that we are swimming
perpendicular to the current, we have the situation depicted below. \\

\begin{ProficiencyDrill}
  \label{drill:VectorAddition}
  \begin{enumerate}[label={\bf{}(\alph*)}]{}
  \item In the diagram above what does the length of the black arrow
    represent physically?
  \item What is the length of the black arrow?
  \end{enumerate}
\end{ProficiencyDrill}

In general you can think of the velocity of an object moving in a
plane as being compounded of a horizontal velocity (the blue arrow in
Drill~\ref{drill:VectorAddition}) and a vertical velocity (the red
arrow in Drill~\ref{drill:VectorAddition}).  This is easiest to think
about when the component velocities are perpendicular but this isn't
strictly necessary. For example, you don't need to be swimming
perpendicular to the
\begin{wrapfigure}[6]{r}{2in}
  \vskip-5mm{} \captionsetup{labelformat=empty}
  \centerline{\includegraphics*[height=1in,width=2in]{../Figures/Vector5}}
  \label{fig:Vector5}
\end{wrapfigure}
current. As seen in the diagram at the right to find the result of two
non-perpendicular velocities (the solid red and blue arrows) we need
only form the parallelogram as shown. The resulting velocity is then
represented by the black diagonal arrow.

Roberval assumed that a curve in the plane is generated by a point
whose motion is an aggregate of two known motions, which can be
represented as arrows. The arrows are then ``added'' by finding the
diagonal of the parallelogram generated by the two arrows. This
diagonal will point in the direction of motion at that point on the
curve and will point tangent to the curve.

\begin{myexample}
  \label{example:RectilinearMotion}
  Suppose a point is moving in the plane so that its horizontal speed
  is $1$ unit per second and its vertical velocity is $2$ units per
  second as in the diagram at the right. Clearly our point is moving
  along the line $y=2x$.
  
  If $t$ represents time in seconds and if the point starts at the
  origin, then its coordinates are given by $x(t)=t$ and\aside{Observe
    that $x(t) = t$ is the algebraic representation of a horizontal
    arrow with length $t$, and $y(t) = 2t$ is the algebraic
    representation of a vertical arrow with length $2t$. Translating
    statements and concepts between Algebra and Geometry is the
    essence of Analytic Geometry.}  $y(t)=2t$.  Since both $x$ and $y$
  are needed to locate the point we will join them together
  notationally like this:
  $$
  P(t)=
  \begin{Bmatrix}
    x(t)\\
    y(t)
  \end{Bmatrix} =
  \begin{Bmatrix}
    t\\
    2t
  \end{Bmatrix}.
  $$
  
  
  \begin{wrapfigure}[19]{r}{2.3in}
    \vskip-1mm{} \captionsetup{labelformat=empty}
    \centerline{\includegraphics*[height=3.6in,width=2.3in]{../Figures/Roberval8}}
    \label{fig:Roberval4}
  \end{wrapfigure}
  You might quite reasonably ask why we've gone to all this bother
  just to have two different ways to represent a particular line:
  $y=2x$, and $P(t)=
  \begin{Bmatrix}
    t\\
    2t
  \end{Bmatrix}.
  $
  The difference is in how we ``think about'' the
  graph. When we write $y=2x$ we are thinking of the entire
  graph. When we write $
  P(t)=
  \begin{Bmatrix}
    x(t)\\
    y(t)
  \end{Bmatrix}
  $ there is an implicit understanding that ($t$)ime is passing and we
  are thinking about the motion of the point.  Thus when $t=1$ the
  point is at $(1,2)$ when $t=2$ it's at $(2,4)$.
  
  Think of the line as a road. The formula $y=2x$ describes the entire
  road, whereas the expression $ P(t)=
  \begin{Bmatrix}
    t\\
    2t
  \end{Bmatrix}
  $ tells us the point's location on the road at any given time, $t$.
  
  The idea of representing velocities with arrows is quite a powerful
  and common technique for representing non-linear motion. Roberval
  used this technique to find the tangent lines of the conic sections
  (as we will soon see) as well as more general curves. Since
  Roberval's time this idea has been developed considerably beyond
  what Roberval did. In fact we are skirting the edge of some very
  deep ideas here. In modern terms these arrows would be called
  \term{vectors}.  \term{Vector Addition} is then done by the
  \term{Parallelogram Rule}, which is essentially what we did with our
  arrows above: Form the parallelogram and find its diagonal.  The
  full force of vector analysis was not available to Roberval, and we
  won't need it, so we will not take you any further down this path
  but we encourage you visualize velocities, and any other directed
  quantity, as composed of horizontal and vertical components whenever
  you can. You will see this representation in more detail later in
  your education and it will help if you have already begun thinking
  in these terms.

\subsection*{The Tangent Lines of the Conic Sections}

  \centerline{\includegraphics*[height=1.5in,width=2.3in]{../Figures/ConicSections}}
  \label{fig:ConicSections}
\end{wrapfigure}
Parabolas, ellipses, and hyperbolas are called conic sections, or just
conics, because they were originally defined as the intersection of a
cone with planes situated at various angles, as shown in the sketches
at the right.

While interesting, the original geometric definitions won't do for our
purposes\aside{This is primarily because we depend very heavily on our
  modern algebraic notation, not because of any inherent flaw in the
  definition. Without any notation at all ancient Greek scholars
  understood the nature of parabolas at least as well as we do
  today. Possibly better.} because they are entirely static. There is
no motion involved.

The more modern algebraic forms are a bit better:
\begin{center}
  \begin{minipage}{.5\linewidth}
    \begin{description}
    \item[Parabolas:] $y=ax^2+bx+c$,
    \item[Ellipses:] $\frac{x^2}{a^2}+\frac{y^2}{b^2}=1$,
    \item[Hyperbolas:] $\frac{x^2}{a^2}-\frac{y^2}{b^2}=\pm1$.
    \end{description}
  \end{minipage}
\end{center}
but they are also static.

To use Roberval's dynamic approach to constructing tangent lines to
the conic sections we will resort to yet a third equivalent
definition. We start with the parabola.


\subsubsection*{The Tangent to a Parabola}

A parabola can also be thought of as the set of points, $P$, in a
plane which are equidistant from a fixed point, $F$, called the
\term{focus} of the parabola, and a specific line, $d$, called the
\term{directrix} of the parabola. Adopting Roberval's dynamic
viewpoint, we can think of $P$ as tracing out the parabola by moving
so that these distances stay equal to each other.

\begin{embeddedproblem-enumerate}{}
  \label{prob:parall-rhombus}
  \begin{enumerate}[label={\bf{}(\alph*)}]
  \item Explain why it must be that the speed at which $P$ moves away
    from $F$ must equal the speed at which $P$ moves away from
    $d$.\\
    \hint{Suppose these speeds were not equal. What would this say
      about the distances from $P$ to $F$ and from $P$ to $d$?}
  \item Consider the following diagram.\\
    \centerline{\includegraphics*[height=1.7in,width=2.5in]{../Figures/GeometricParabola3}}
    If $PV$ represents the velocity of the motion of $P$ away from
    $F$, and $PU$ represents the velocity of the motion of $P$ away
    from $d$, then according to Roberval, the diagonal, $PR$ of the
    parallelogram $PVRU$ is tangent to the parabola. Use the result of
    part (a) to explain why this parallelogram is a rhombus\aside{A
      \term{rhombus} is a parallelogram where the four sides have
      equal length.}.
  \item In our sketch the angle $\beta$ is between the arrows $PU$ and
    $PR.$ We have also extended the arrow $PR$ downward to form the
    angle $\alpha$ with $FP.$ Given that the parallelogram $PVRU$ in
    the previous figure is a rhombus, show that the two angles,
    $\alpha,$ $\beta$ are congruent.
  \end{enumerate}
\end{embeddedproblem-enumerate}



\begin{wrapfigure}[9]{r}{1.5in}
  \captionsetup{labelformat=empty} \vskip-7mm{}
  \centerline{\includegraphics*[height=1.5in,width=1.5in]{../Figures/Roberval7}}
  \label{fig:NewtonTelescope}
\end{wrapfigure}
That $\alpha$ and $\beta$ in the previous problem are congruent has an
interesting consequence in optics. Imagine that the inside of our
parabola is a mirror, and that a light source has been placed at the
point $F.$ As we have seen when light reflects off of a flat mirror
the angle of incidence is equal to the angle of reflection. Since this
mirror isn't flat the angles of incidence and reflection are measured
from the line tangent to the parabola at the point where the light
strikes the mirror. Thus the angle of incidence of a beam emerging
from $F$ and striking the parabola at $P$ will be $\alpha$ in our
diagram and the angle of reflection will be $\beta (=\alpha).$ It
follows that a light beam emerging from $F$ and reflecting from the
parabola at any point will follow a path parallel to the axis of
symmetry of the parabola after reflecting from the interior of the
parabola.




You can see this in action with your car headlights or a
flashlight. The reflector is cast in the shape of a parabola and the
light emitting filament is place at the focus, so all of the light
which strikes the reflector gets reflected in that direction.

\begin{wrapfigure}[15]{l}{2.3in}
  \captionsetup{labelformat=empty} \vskip-3mm{}
  \centerline{\includegraphics*[height=2.3in,width=2.3in]{../Figures/Satellite1}}
  % \url{https://kids.britannica.com/students assembly/view/67385}}
  \label{fig:Satellite1}
\end{wrapfigure}
Now turn this around. Any light beam coming parallel to axis of
symmetry and striking the parabolic mirror will pass through the focal
point $F$. The light is thus focused and the image appears larger.
This fact was used by Isaac Newton in the seventeenth century to
design a new, and better, telescope than the one used by Galileo a
generation earlier. Galileo's telescope was based on the refraction of
light as it passes through shaped lenses.  Through his study of optics
Newton learned that the magnification effect could also be achieved
via reflection.  It was his invention of the reflecting telescope that
first brought Newton into scientific prominence.

The fundamental optical principle he used, a light beam traveling
parallel to the axis of symmetry, after reflecting from the interior
of a parabolic mirror, will pass through the focus of the parabola, is
the underlying design principle of all reflective telescopes, large
and small, today.



In fact, you use this every day. Since radio waves are a form of
electromagnetic radiation, just like visible light, this is also a
fundamental design point for both radar antennas, satellite cable TV
dishes, and the antennas at the tops of cell phone towers.

\subsubsection*{The Tangent to an Ellipse}
\begin{wrapfigure}[]{r}{2.5in}
  \vskip-9mm{} \captionsetup{labelformat=empty}
  \centerline{\includegraphics*[height=1.8in,width=2.5in]{../Figures/Ellipse}}
  \label{fig:Ellipse}
\end{wrapfigure}
Geometrically, an ellipse is the set of points in a plane, the sum of
where the sum of the distances from two fixed points (foci) is a
constant. Following Roberval we can generate an ellipse by combining
two motions: one away from one focus ($F_1P$) and one toward the other
focus ($PF_2$) as in the sketch at the right.  If we set $d_1$ equal
to the length of $F_1P$ and $d_2$ equal to the length of $PF_2$, then
$d_1+d_2$ is constant.

Because $d_1+d_2$ is constant it should be clear that the rate at
which $d_1$ lengthens is related to the rate at which $d_2$ shortens.
These rates of change are represented by the red arrows in our sketch.

\begin{embeddedproblem}{}
  \label{problem:EllipseRhombus}
  Explain why the parallelogram in the sketch above must be a rhombus
  and use this to show that angle $\alpha$ is congruent to
  angle $\beta.$ \\
  \hint{ An argument very similar to the one used in
    Problem~\#\ref{prob:parall-rhombus} will work.}
\end{embeddedproblem}

From Problem~\#\ref{problem:EllipseRhombus} we see that any light ray,
sound wave, etc., emanating from one focus of an ellipse will reflect
off of the interior of the ellipse to the other focus.



A playful example of the reflective properties of an ellipse are the
so-called ``whisper galleries.''  If you and a friend stand at the
foci of a room in the shape of an ellipse you will be able to converse
in whispers even if you are very far apart. This is because the sound
waves from your friend's voice will spread out to the walls and then
reflect back to the other focus, where you are standing. Naturally,
the volume of sound from any single location in the interior of the
ellipse will have dropped considerably in transit. However, since all
of them travel the same distance to get to you they arrive at the same
time and the volume you hear is the sum of all of the individual
reflected volumes.

\begin{wrapfigure}[11]{l}{2.8in}
  \captionsetup{labelformat=empty} \vskip-3mm{}
  \centerline{\href{https://ephemeralnewyork.wordpress.com/2015/09/07/the-whispering-gallery-in-grand-central-terminal/}{\includegraphics*[height=1.7in,width=2.8in]{../Figures/WhisperGallery1}}}
  \label{fig:WhisperGallery1}
\end{wrapfigure}
The whisper gallery shown at the left is the one in Grand Central
Station in New York City. The young woman on the left and the young
man on the right are standing at the foci and speaking to each other
quietly.

There is another whisper gallery in Statuary Hall in the Capitol
building in Washington DC. This room was originally the meeting hall
for the House of Representatives. It is said that when John Quincy
Adams was a representative he would eavesdrop on his political enemies
by placing himself at one focus of the room whenever he saw them
talking quietly at the other.  A more serious application of this
reflective property is used in modern medicine to treat kidney stones.
The treatment is called Extra-corporeal Shock Wave
Lithotripsy\aside{Lithotripsy literally means ``rock grinding.''}.


\subsubsection*{The Tangent to an Hyperbola}
If an ellipse is the locus of points the sum of whose distances from
two given points is constant it is natural to ask, ``What do we get
when the difference of their distances is constant?'' That is the
shape
called the hyperbola seen in the diagram below.\\
\centerline{\includegraphics*[height=1.8in,width=2in]{../Figures/Hyperbola1}}
As before, we set $d_1$ and $d_2$ equal to the lengths of $F_1P$ and
$F_2P$, respectively. An hyperbola has the property that $d_1-d_2$ is
constant.

\begin{embeddedproblem}{}
  Explain why the parallelogram in the sketch above must be a rhombus
  and use this to show that angle $\alpha$ is congruent to angle
  $\beta.$ As before in our diagram the red arrows represent the
  velocity of $P$
  in the direction from $F_1$ to $P$ and from $F_2$ to $P$.\\
  % \hint{Because the curve is an hyperbola $d_1$-$d_2$ must be
  % constant.}
\end{embeddedproblem}

\begin{wrapfigure}[9]{r}{2.5in}
  \vskip-6mm{} \captionsetup{labelformat=empty}
  \centerline{\includegraphics*[height=1.5in,width=2.5in]{../Figures/CassegrainAntenna}}
  \label{fig:CassegrainAntenna}
\end{wrapfigure}
The hyperbola also has interesting reflective properties. If a beam of
light is aimed at one focus it will reflect off of the hyperbola
toward the other focus. This property can be used to further refine
the design of reflecting telescopes and antennae. The figure at the
right shows the design of Cassegrain antenna. The large, primary
mirror on the left is parabolic and shares a focus with the smaller,
secondary, hyperbolic mirror on the right. Light reflecting off of the
primary mirror is directed at the shared focus on the right where it
is reflected to the other focus at the primary mirror. A detection
device is then placed at the secondary focus to collect the amplified
signal.

Roberval's use of arrows to represent velocities provides an intuitive
way to understand the reflective properties of the conic
sections. Moreover, thinking of curves as being traced out in time it
gives us a dynamical way of looking at curves. This was a viewpoint
that Newton adopted in his version of the Calculus.

\section{Snell's Law and the Limitations of Adequality: }
\label{sec:snells-law-refr}
\markright{\sc{}Snell's Law of Refraction} When light passes from one
medium to another, say from air to water, it bends. This property is
called refraction.  The physical law governing refraction is known as
Snell's Law, named after the Dutch
Astronomer
\href{https://mathshistory.st-andrews.ac.uk/Biographies/Snell/}{Willebrord
  Snell} $(1580-1626)$ though it was accurately described before that
time.  In modern terms, Snell's Law can be stated as follows.


\noindent{\underline{\bf Snell's Law of Refraction}:} Suppose that
light travels with a velocity of $v_1$ in the first medium and
velocity $v_2$ in second medium, and that $\theta_1$ and
$\theta_2$ are as seen in the diagram below.\\
\centerline{\includegraphics*[height=1in,width=2in]{../Figures/Refraction2}}
Then the path that light follows satisfies
$$
\frac{\sin(\theta_1)}{v_1} = \frac{\sin(\theta_2)}{v_2 }.  $$
% \begin{wrapfigure}[]{r}{2.3in}
% %   \vskip-3mm{}
%   \captionsetup{labelformat=empty}
%   %   \centerline{\href{https://mathshistory.st-andrews.ac.uk/Biographies/Snell/}{\includegraphics*[height=1.9in,width=1.8in]{../Figures/Snell.png}}}
%   \centerline{\href{https://mathshistory.st-andrews.ac.uk/Biographies/Snell/}{\includegraphics*[height=2.4in,width=2.3in]{../Figures/Snell.png}}}
%   \label{fig:Snell}
%   \caption{\centerline{Willebrord Snell}\\ \centerline{1580-1626}}
% \end{wrapfigure}
Notice that if $v_1=v_2$ this says that
$\sin(\theta_1)=\sin(\theta_2)$ and the path of the line would be a
straight line.

A number of mathematicians, including both Snell and Fermat, gave
derivations of Snell's Law, but we will focus on Fermat's method.  To
attack this problem, Fermat refined the \emph{Nature is Lazy}
assumption a bit. Instead of assuming that that light would follow the
shortest path, he assumed that light would follow the path that takes
the least time.

Notice that this is consistent with our observations concerning
reflections from a mirror.  In that case, the speed of light was
constant so the shortest path was, in fact, the fastest path. But
refraction occurs because the velocity of light changes when the
surrounding medium changes.

Let's see what happens when we try to use Fermat's Method of
Adequality to find this fastest path.


\begin{embeddedproblem}{}
  \label{PIC:FermatSnell}
  Assuming that the velocity\aside{Is it clear to you that we've used
    velocity here when we really mean speed?  If not, think about it
    for a moment. We're really only interested how fast light travels
    in either medium, not in the direction it is going. This was the
    language used in the seventeenth century so it is accurate
    historically, but not mathematically.  Unfortunately, it is still
    common to use these words interchangeably, even among folks who
    know better. This can be quite confusing for the beginner but
    there isn't much that can be done except be aware of the
    problem. Whenever you encounter either word pause of a moment and
    ask yourself if the speaker or author means speed, or velocity. It
    should always be clear from the context.} of light is $v_1$ in the
  first medium and
  $v_2$ in the second,  use the following  diagram:\\
  \centerline{\includegraphics*[height=1.9in,width=3.5in]{../Figures/Refraction4}}
  to show the time, $t$, for light to travel along the path from $A$
  to $C$ $B$ is
  $ \frac{\sqrt{a^2+x^2}}{v_1}+\frac{\sqrt{b^2+(c-x)^2}}{v_2}.  $
\end{embeddedproblem}


Of course the next step would be to use Fermat's Method of Adequality
to minimize $t$, but the square roots involved make the Algebra
daunting to say the least. Despite these difficulties Fermat was able
to show that $t$ is minimized precisely when Snell's Law holds.

Although it is possible to derive Snell's Law with the tools we now
have it is very difficult so we won't attempt it here. Instead we will
return to this problem in Chapter~\ref{cha:what-deriv-tells} where we
will complete the derivation of Snell's Law using the rules of
Calculus. That will be much simpler.

% Nevertheless you should try this problem. Take it as far as you can
% but don't get discouraged if you can't complete the Algebra. We
% couldn't either.

It seems that our efforts to solve optimization problems using
pre-Calculus techniques has hit an impasse. To be sure those
techniques, and others of a similar nature, were very clever and it
must be admitted that they yielded interesting and correct
results. However for the most part they were \foreign{ad hoc} methods
and quite limited in their applicability. We need a way to overcome
these limitations.

This is exactly what the invention of Calculus in the mid-seventeenth
century did. The title of Leibniz' first published work on Calculus
makes this very clear:

\begin{minipage}[]{.85\linewidth}
  \it A New Method for Maxima and Minima, as Well as Tangents, Which
  is Impeded Neither by Fractional nor Irrational Quantities, and a

\noindent{}It is time for us to learn about this \emph{Remarkable Type
  of Calculus}.
