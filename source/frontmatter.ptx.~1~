The authors wish first and foremost to express our gratitude to the
students who were subjected to various rough drafts of this textbook
in a classroom setting.  Our intention was always to write a
student-centered textbook. To whatever extent we have succeeded in
achieving that goal the insights and suggestions of these students
were an invaluable help and we are very grateful to them for that.
</p>
<p>

Second, we wish to thank Dr. H. Joseph Straight, Distinguished Service
Professor at SUNY, Fredonia for agreeing to use some of the earlier
drafts in his classes. With grace and professionalism, he guided his
students through, and sometimes around, the poor organization, murky
examples, and innumerable typos of these early versions,
simultaneously giving us precious insights and suggestions for
improvement. His comments were always on point and we are deeply
appreciative of all of his efforts.
</p>
<p>

We also wish to thank Allison Brown at Milne Open Textbooks for her
patience with us.  We are sure that she grew very tired of getting
emails from us saying that we were almost done only to find that we
still had a lot more polishing to do. Through it all her support was
unwavering and we are deeply indebted to her for it.
</p>
<p>

Last, but certainly not least, we wish to thank our copy editor, Dr. Margo
Boman, for all of her help in getting us to the current version of
this book.  When we employed her in this capacity, we thought that we
were nearly done.  It turned out that we were sadly mistaken.  Margo's
attention to detail and her pedagogical expertise were instrumental in
transforming a collection of stories and problems into a much more
coherent and polished narrative.  It was more work than both she and
we anticipated, but it was worth it and we are deeply beholden to her.
Future teachers and students using this book will benefit enormously
from her contribution.
</p>
<p>

Finally, any errors that might still appear in this text are the
fault, and sole responsibility, of the authors.

        "Thus, a schism appeared between the theory and the practice
        of the calculus as the level of rigour in the calculus was
        raised: the foundationalists had one set of rules, the
        practitioners another. The situation has persisted to this
        day, with quite the unfortunate and unnecessary confusions for
        students.  It is common experience for them to learn in
        calculus lectures that infinitesimally small differentials do
        not exist, but to use them constantly in the mathematical
        physics lectures. While Eulerian calculus is not rigorous, it
        should be taught for what it is: a powerful tool for the
        analysis of physical and geometric phenomena, which has left
        its considerable mark on the conceptions, terminology, and
        notations of later presentations of the subject. As things
        are, the treatment in textbooks is unsatisfactory. Some
        basically follow Cauchy's practice of notating the derivative
        by <m>f^\prime</m> and defining the differential by some
        equivalent of this, while others notate the derivative by the
        single symbol <m>\dfdx{y}{x}</m> and omit differentials
        altogether; and neither treatment warns the reader of the
        existence of the other. Further, both treatments give a prime
        place to limits without explaining why the standard of rigour
        and generality obtainable from this very difficult concept is
        desirable in the first place, or what kinds of less rigorous
        approaches are being superseded."
